	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. John Major)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Finance Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
On behalf of the Committee, Mr. Crowther, I welcome you to the Chair. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] As you will realise from that roar of acclaim, you were such a success as co-Chairman last year that we are delighted to have you back this year. We welcome also Mr. Cormack, who may take the Chair from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know, Mr. Crowther, although other hon. Members do not, that at this moment you could have been in either Paris or Milan. It is a tribute to your sense of duty that you are here, or perhaps it is because of the compelling oratory that you expect to hear from members of the Committee as they discuss the clauses dealing with Customs and Excise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have some debutants to the Finance Bill Committee this year. I am sure that they will find it an intriguing experience. If they ever see their families again, they will be able to tell them what it is like to serve on a Finance Bill. But sitting on the Opposition Benches are also some battle-scarred veterans of former Finance Bill Committees whose masochistic tendencies have encouraged them to serve again. I hope that their previous experience will lead them to draw the same conclusion as I do about the Bill. It is a long Bill, but it is not especially tendentious. I hope that we shall proceed with maximum peace, harmony and speed and minimum disturbance. But however matters proceed, Mr. Crowther, I have no doubt that you will preside with your customary impartiality and fairness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Chief Secretary for his assurance about the oratory. With the greatest respect to all hon. Members, I hope that we do not have too much of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) cannot be with us today, so it falls to me, on behalf of the Opposition, to welcome you, Mr. Crowther, to the Chair of our proceedings. Lest Conservative Members be in any doubt, my hon. Friend's absence is not an early concession to the Government. He is away making trouble for the Government in Wales, although that seems to be a slightly superfluous exercise as the Government have enough trouble in Wales already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the right hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) said:
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"We must consider carefully whether it will be possible for any Standing Committee to give their Bill the attention that it needs if our financial legislation is to be properly scrutinised."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 25 April 1989; Vol. 151, c.831–832.]</p></blockquote>
I do not have to remind hon. Members that reputations are made and lost on the Finance Bill. The Labour Whip on the Committee last year, my hon. Friend the Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram), was justly rewarded with promotion to the post of PPS to the leader of the Labour party for the part that he played in our affairs. However, terrible retribution was meted out by the Government on their Whip on the Committee last year, the hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Mr. Lennox-Boyd). If events continue in that way, either the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) or my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths)—or perhaps both of them—will be running the country in a few years while the rest of us are herded into Committee Room 9 to hear more from my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) on the subject of amendments to section 20(1)(a) of the Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Whips may have organised their escape, but the rest of the Government and Opposition Front-Bench teams have been sent back to replay the event. The Prime Minister has inadvisedly ignored my suggestions about promotions on the Government side, and, equally, the Social and Liberal Democratic party ignored the advice that I offered during its leadership contest. Therefore, the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) rejoins our deliberations. We are sentenced to each other's company for the next three months, and we shall trawl through the details of yesterday's news—an opportunity that all politicians welcome. However, as in all good penal systems, there is the possibility of remission for good conduct. Under your wise and impartial guidance, Mr. Crowther, the Committee will discharge its duties thoroughly and give the Bill more consideration than parts of it deserve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. J. Beith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick-upon-Tweed)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to add to the welcome that has been given to you, Mr. Crowther. As I look across to the Government Benches, I see that there has been some overkill there. I do not know for how long Conservative Members will keep those Benches so packed or what discontent will eventually surface. I hope that some is expressed before the Committee ends. I have no intention of fighting a party leadership election during the proceedings of the Committee. If someone can find another escape route, I hope that he will tell me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As our proceedings move on, it will become apparent—as it does every year—that the suggestions to which you, Mr. Crowther, and I put our name as members of the Select Committee on Procedure are relevant. There should be more opportunity for the Committees of the House to examine witnesses and not just debate the matter among ourselves. If we listened to those who know about the abstruse and arcane details of what we are about to discuss, our legislation would be better framed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I invite the Chief Secretary to the Treasury to move the motion on the order of consideration, I have some announcements to make. My fellow Chairman or I will repeat them when necessary at a later stage, but it may be for the convenience of the Committee if I make them now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that all right hon. and hon. Members will appreciate that Committee Room 10 is not available on Thursday afternoons until about 7 o'clock. That is because of party meetings. That is why we are in the cramped conditions of Committee Room 9. I propose that when we return after the dinner break we sit in Committee Room 10 in rather more comfortable conditions. On Tuesdays that will not apply. We shall be in Committee Room 10 in any case then because the party meetings do not take place. Boxes are provided for hon. Members who wish to use them. They can be locked away in Room 10. I must stress that hon. Members will be responsible for their own boxes; they cannot be moved from room to room by the staff of the House. If hon. Members wish to use those boxes, they will be in personal charge of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members know, when a division is called in this Committee, it appears on the annuciator, which does not happen with other Standing Committees. I shall allow a maximum of three minutes for the Division after the announcement has appeared on the annunciator. I emphasise that that is a maximum. If it appears that hon. Members are present, we shall take the Division in less than three minutes. As for the dinner break, my general intention will be to suspend the sitting for dinner at around 7 o'clock or at some convenient time thereafter. The dinner break will last for 90 minutes. If there is a Division in the Chamber, 15 minutes will be added for each Division. If Divisions are called in the Chamber while we are sitting, the sitting will be suspended for 15 minutes for each Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Copies of the Ways and Means resolutions are on the table. The Bill is founded on them and if any member of the Committee wishes to have them, they are available. An additional resolution was agreed by the House last night. That will also be available to hon. Members. I have to make the usual announcement that adequate notice must be given of amendments and therefore it will not be my general practice, other than in exceptional circumstances, to select manuscript or starred amendments. That is all that I have to say at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the order in which proceedings on the Finance Bill are to be taken shall be Clauses 2 to 6, Schedule 1, Clause 7, Schedule 2, Clauses 8 to 16, Clause 25, Clauses 55 to 57, Clause 17, Schedule 3, Clauses 18 to 24, Clauses 26 to 31, Clauses 34 to 43, Clauses 46 to 49, Clauses 111 and 112, Clauses 118 and 119, Clause 50, Clauses 52 to 54, Clause 58, Schedule 4, Clause 62, Clause 45, Clauses 59 to 61, Clauses 63 to 71, Schedule 5, Clause 72, Schedule 6, Clauses 73 and 74, Schedule 7, Clauses 75 and 76, Clause 136, Clauses 77 to 80, Schedule 8, Clauses 81 to 86, Schedule 9, Clause 169, Clauses 87 to 89, Schedule 10, Clause 90, Schedule 11, Clauses 91 to 96, Clause 152, Clauses 98 to 108, Schedule 12, Clauses 109 and 110, Clauses 113 to 117, Clauses 120 and 121, Schedule 13; Clauses 122 to 124, Schedule 14, Clauses 125 to 135, Clause 137, Schedule 15, Clauses 139 to 151, Clauses 153 to 156, Clause 97, Clauses 157 to 168, Clauses 170 to 173, Schedule 16, Clauses 174 to 180, new Clauses, new Schedules, Schedule 17.—[	<i>Mr. Major.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Crowther. Conservative Members are clearly in need of a good trade union official, and here I am to help them. The issue that I am about to raise with you was raised on the Finance Bill last year and it is about the working conditions in this Room on Thursdays. It is almost intolerable that we should be shoved in here in close proximity to discuss important matters, without room to spread our papers, or to move much at all. The conditions are not conducive to giving the matters before us the consideration that they, at least in some cases, merit. I urge you, Mr. Crowther, to see whether it is possible to find us a bigger Room before 6 o'clock rather than afterwards. Perhaps you can enlist the Government's assistance in that. We found it very difficult last year and it seems wrong that we should go through it all again this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with the point that the hon. Member makes, but I am sure that all hon. Members who are familiar with these premises are aware that there are only two large Committee Rooms on this Corridor, Committee Rooms 10 and 14, and it happens that they are in use at 6 o'clock every Thursday night for purposes quite unconnected with the Bill. Perhaps I ought to rephrase that. The Bill may be discussed from time to time in those Rooms, so I should say, purposes unconnected with this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If right hon. and hon. Members care to exert their influence on their respective parties, they may have some success, although I doubt it. I understand the hon. Member's point and I agree entirely that these circumstances are not acceptable, but I do not have a solution, unless party meetings can take place elsewhere. I am sure that Ministers have noted the point that the hon. Member has raised and if they wish to pursue it, that is a matter for them. Regrettably, it is not a matter for me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall now proceed to clause 2, and amendment No. 20.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Major</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Too long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It usually takes two or three hours before Conservative Members start shouting, "Too long."

I beg to move amendment No. 20, in page 2, line 28, leave out "cases or".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall consider amendment No. 22, in page 2, line 44, leave out "cases or".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo what the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) said about our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0011">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
business in Committees being very much of an oppositional nature. Ministers have briefs to counter Opposition amendments, which usually have "Resist" written in capital letters at the top. I realise that that is part of the constitutional system and that the raison d'être of a Minister in a Committee is to secure the passage of the Bill without amendment, unless a mistake has been made and a Government amendment has to be tabled. That is always a great pity, but I hope that we can make progress on this Bill on a more co-operative basis, especially as the Chief Secretary said that he did not consider the Bill to be tendentious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, if the Bill is not tendentious and will not divide the Committee too much, we shall try to be co-operative and help the Government. As the Bill has had its Second Reading and as the House of Commons has agreed in principle that it should go into Committee, we shall try to improve it, on a co-operative basis. I hope that we shall be able to proceed quickly and that, contrary to last year when we made much progress in the first sitting and then became stuck on clause 13, we can go steadily on and improve the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that spirit, I shall not make a long statement on the amendments, but amendment No. 20 is important. However, because Opposition Members do not have access to all the expertise and knowledge pertaining to financial legislation, we may be tabling amendments that are wrong—I think that one of our later amendments is wrong. Also, the amendments may be unnecessary, and if so, the Economic Secretary will be able to explain why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried that this provision could result in the regulations making special laws for special and individual cases. That is bad law in principle. Regulations should always cover classes of cases. An amendment may not be necessary to specifically rule out helping Mr. Jones with a particular problem. If that cannot occur, there is no need for the amendment. Clause 2(2)(b) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"provide for relief to be allowed in cases or classes of case set out in the regulations."</p></blockquote>
The commissioners may not intend to deal with individual cases in those regulations, but we must ensure that they cannot even be tempted to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the spirit of co-operation, I shall not expand my case. I have made my point and shall be interested to hear the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Peter Lilley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to be back under your chairmanship, Mr. Crowther, and facing the battle-hardened troops on Opposition Benches. I am encouraged by my own seasoned troops behind me, reinforced by some new talent conscripted from outside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the features of last year's Committee, in which we gained our experience, was the often constructive nature of the amendments. I am glad that we are off to a good start with an amendment proposed in a spirit with which I have much sympathy. I do not intend powers to be created to give individuals preferential treatment, although I
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
agree that to non-lawyers such as myself, the reason for the wording was not immediately apparent. However, I understand that it is a standard legal term; indeed, there are 127 cases in law where the phrase,
	<br><blockquote><p>"in cases or classes of case"</p></blockquote>
is used. It is standard legal drafting in legislation such as the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. To truncate the phrase would cause difficulties and undermine the use of the phrase elsewhere in legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the Minister, I am a non-lawyer, so the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"in cases or classes of case"</p></blockquote>
does not mean much to me. Will the Minister explain the exact reason for keeping the wording as it is, and what would happen if the amendment were adopted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The meaning of the phrase is that it effectively includes a class of one. We may have to deal with a single example and it is, apparently, difficult to phrase a class of one in law. That does not mean that we intend to enable the Government to set up special privileges for named individuals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that an individual case would be unique, or might other individuals have the same case to put to the Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, it means that a case might be unique at the time of framing it, but other virtually identical cases may arise. They would then constitute a class. So although the wording is not satisfactory to non-lawyers such as myself and the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths), I hope that the Committee will recognise that it is standard legal terminology and has no nefarious intent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If none of my hon. Friends wishes to make any further points, and in view of the Economic Secretary's comments about lawyers' strange inability to write down exactly what they mean—that does not happen often—I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 21, in page 2, line 35, after "conditions", insert "imposed by the reglations".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2(2) says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The regulations may include such provision as the Commissioners think fit in connection with allowing reliefs, and in particular may—
	<br><blockquote><p>(e) provide for relief to be allowed subject to such conditions as the Commissioners may impose on the person claiming relief.</p></blockquote></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the spirit in which the amendment has been tabled. It is in line with the purpose of the clause, which seeks to reduce the number of extra-statutory concessions and get all details on a firm legislative basis. None-the-less, although normally we should hope to incorporate any details of legislation in regulations, which would have to be approved by the House, there can be a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0012">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
need for the commissioners to specify administrative details of how those regulations should be implemented—for example, details of record-keeping, submission of returns and retention of records. That would be cumbersome in regulations, and might have to be varied frequently with the changing nature of business. We should not want the House to have to replace all the regulations every time a change was made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a fairly well-established practice to give such discretion to commissioners to introduce conditions for administrative handling of regulations. For example, in the Excise Duties (Hydrocarbon Oils) (Deferred Payment) Regulations 1985, that power exists in virtually identical wording. It is used for such matters as imposing conditions on keeping records on liabilities incurred, and such like. Therefore, having established the meaning of the measure, I hope that we shall be able to do without the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the Economic Secretary has said, it is difficult for the Opposition to insist on the amendment. When we debate amendment No. 24, which is about the commissioners publishing details of their activities, we might seek more information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the Economic Secretary's words, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 23, in page 3, line 9, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"be liable on summary conviction",</p></blockquote>
and insert "on summary conviction pay".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be useful if the Economic Secretary could tell us about the sentencing policy on penalties for those who contravene Customs and Excise rules and who are prosecuted. The amendment perhaps represents a more puritan spirit of the Opposition; it seeks to toughen up the penalties that must be paid when a person contravenes or fails to comply with a regulation made under this measure. Subsection (4)(a) states that a person
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall be liable on summary conviction to a penalty of three times the value of any goods".</p></blockquote>
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not mean that he will be sentenced to a penalty of three times the value of any goods. The amendment simply toughens up the provision. It removes the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"be liable on summary conviction"—</p></blockquote>
the amendment is slightly defective because it does not include the word "to", but never mind that—and provides that a person shall
	<br><blockquote><p>"on summary conviction pay"</p></blockquote>
a penalty of three times the value of any goods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (b) goes on to say that the goods will "be liable to forfeiture". We considered whether any goods should be forfeited, but we believe that that discretion should be given to the judge or magistrates; depending upon the individual circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A reasonable compromise would be to insist on a penalty of three times the value of any goods. I hate
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
to introduce a contentious note, but especially with the Government's insistence on trying to save as much public expenditure as possible and their not properly staffing Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue, people will frequently say, "The chances of getting caught are not great. The maximum penalty is three times, but in practice the judges have been issuing penalties of only one and a half times, so it is worth the risk of not complying with any of the regulations."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is so, this legislation is ineffective and we are defeating its purpose. The Opposition are trying to be helpful. We think that the Government should use more of a stick so that people who may be tempted to be lackadaisical in complying with the regulations will concentrate and spend a little more time making sure that they comply. I shall be interested to hear the Economic Secretary's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) asked about sentencing policy. That is obviously a matter for the courts, and I am afraid that I cannot give him any statistical information on how they have interpreted the discretion that they have been given in parallel cases. However, our policy—which has generally been adopted by Parliament—has always been to give the courts an element of discretion so that, up to the maximum penalty, they can relate the actual penalty to the precise circumstances of the case. That is what the current wording of the clause does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, the proposed wording would deprive a court of that discretion, which the Government would not be in favour of doing because we believe that the courts should be able to adapt the sentence within the range provided to the precise circumstances of the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pontypridd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little perplexed about what the sentences are likely to be. The clause refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"three times the value of any goods".</p></blockquote>
Will the Economic Secretary tell me exactly what is meant by hydrocarbon oil, as we are debating it? I thought that all oil was hydrocarbon. I understand that there is a light hydrocarbon and a heavy hydrocarbon. If it is heavy hydrocarbon, is the hon. Gentleman talking about fuel oil—in which case, there would be very large penalties indeed, would there not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most oils are hydrocarbons, but not all hydrocarbons are oils. I do not know whether that gets us a great deal further. The nature of the clause is fairly general and covers all specific reliefs relating to duties on hydrocarbon oils. Some will be very valuable; some will involve large quantities and some small. That is why the penalty is specified in this way, so that where people are dealing in large quantities of a valuable commodity, the penalty is potentially large. Where they are dealing with only a small amount of a less valuable commodity, the potential penalty is smaller.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Major</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is right. What an extraordinary lack of confidence my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary shows. However, it is a comfort to know that it is right. I hope that the Committee will see the logic of the clause as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nevertheless, will the Economic Secretary look into the sentencing policy to make sure that the intentions are carried out in practice? The Minister nods. In that case, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 24, in page, 3, line 23, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(7) The Commissioners shall publish in each financial year a report relating to the previous financial year showing the reliefs given in the various classes of case and the individual total reliefs of the various classes.".</p></blockquote>
I do not suggest that the Committee should spend much time on the amendment, but it deserves some consideration. It seeks to add a new subsection (7) to section 20AA of the Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979. If the phrase,
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the various classes of case"</p></blockquote>
is not legalistic, the amendment may not have the best wording, but its intention is clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every year we have problems in Finance Bill Committees about which extra-statutory concession has been given by Customs and Excise and to whom. Perhaps there are publications that shed light on such matters, but I have not seen them. It would be useful if Customs and Excise could, in a special report, as a requirement of the Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979, tell the public what it is doing and how it interprets regulations, especially as the Economic Secretary has said that it would be inappropriate to put in all the conditions and that some concessions have to be extra-statutory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will think seriously about accepting the amendment or tabling another on Report if our wording is not acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yesterday, on the Floor of the House, I asked the Financial Secretary whether he would consider publishing monitoring reports of the way that the business expansion scheme is used, for example. The public have a right to know how public money is spent, especially in local government, and where reliefs go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday I drew this analogy. The Department of the Environment instructed local authorities three years ago to publish detailed monitoring reports every year on how they spent their money on the urban programme. So there is no reason why there should not be regular monitoring reports of how public money is spent and how reliefs contribute to that public expenditure. Not only public expenditure but reliefs come from the Treasury. We should know to whom the reliefs go and how much they are.

us, certainly in the spirit, if not in the wording of the amendment, and instruct Customs and Excise to publish what could be described as monitoring reports. Each year it would then be made plain exactly where the money has gone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the points made by the hon. Members for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) and for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle), but there are distinct problems. The amendment refers to reliefs and, in effect, asks for records to be kept of tax that is not paid. That would impose an additional burden on industry, which does not necessarily have those figures; it would be required to keep them, transfer them to Customs and Excise and then have them collated and collected. We do not have those figures at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may give an example of what might be involved. I hope that I get it right. If I do not, no doubt my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary will let me know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a garage washes out a tank that contained mineral oil and recycles some of that filthy oil, it gets certain reliefs because it does not sell that to the public. It does not keep a record of the tax that it has not paid on the oil used for cleaning out tanks. To require that records are kept in such circumstances would impose an added burden on business and I am sure that no one wishes to do that if it can be avoided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Economic Secretary saying that no one keeps the records? The logic of his remarks is that we do not know how much tax relief is involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. A record of the volumes will be kept at the time and a calculation will be made. But, in the end, the company must pay a certain amount of duty. It will be liable to checks and spot checks to ensure that it is acting in the right way. However, it will not separately identify the amount of tax that is not paid for each specific relief in a way that would be convenient for the compilation of the figures that the amendment suggests should be published. It would involve a collating burden of all the figures in the internal accounts and records of those companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give an easy answer to that question. We are talking about a power to translate extra-statutory concessions into legislation. Just how many that will be remains to be seen. There are not many—some six of the 19 Customs and Excise ESCs are accounted for by the hydrocarbon oil ESCs. In total, they amount to less than £10 million, but how many could be translated into law remains to be seen. But given the small sums involved, I hope that the committee will reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Suppose that the price of oil suffered the type of fall that it has suffered over the past three to four years and suddenly it became profitable for oil companies to use residues from the refining process as fuel oil for power stations. In those circumstances, surely they could begin to refine less and to use more of the residue as a source of profit in the future. How will the clause relate to such a movement, because oil prices can be very volatile?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary, the clause will tighten up prices. At present there is an extra-statutory concession. It is one of the ESCs to which I referred in rather vague terms, but I would not expect hon. Members to rely on the details that I gave about its operation; none the less, it operates as an extra-statutory concession. But if circumstances changed, and it became an opportunity for a rip-off instead of a desirable concession, we should have to do something about it. In any case, if it were made a legal provision, the House would have the opportunity to ensure that such a legal provision did not allow the switching of intention of which the hon. Member for Pontypridd (Mr. Howells) spoke. I am informed that a major part of the maximum £10 million relief has not yet even been given on petroleum vapour recovered, and that is one reason why the estimate is vague.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I sympathise with the Minister, because it is clear that he knows about as much about it as I did when I first looked at the amendment. Nevertheless, it highlights the need for
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Departments to be more ready to impart information about what they do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the Minister's comment that to collect information from every industrial user, who is gaining what in most cases will be a fairly small amount, would involve a disproportionate cost. But perhaps we should look at the general picture. This is not exactly within the framework of the amendment; I put the suggestion to the Minister as an alternative that he need not accept, but merely agree to look at. The logical assumption of having penalties is that occasionally people are convicted, and I wonder how many cases there are. It is another example of information that may be held by the Customs and Excise rather than by the hapless users.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about extra-statutory concessions, and as such, no penalties are involved.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 is not too contentious. It is a pity that the Committee did not accept amendment No. 24 because, although the Customs and Excise publishes a list of extra-statutory concessions, not much additional information is available. I hope that the Economic Secretary will at least take into account the spirit of the debate in Committee and see what he can do. It would not increase the administrative burden on industry, and it would be a minor administrative burden to the Customs and Excise, to let the public have any further information about extra-statutory concessions that may easily be obtained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that latter point, we hope that we are dealing with a diminishing problem since the purpose of the clause is to diminish the number of extra-statutory concessions and translate them into law. Should any hon. Member wish to know the revenue forgone on either an extra-statutory concession or the subsequent regulations that replace it, that information can be elicited by a parliamentary question if it is available to us. We would always do our best to provide such information. When this provision is on a firm legislative basis, the information is likely to be more forthcoming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is in line with the spirit of the House, which has always been jealous of its right to tax and does not like the power to alter or raise taxation to pass from its hands. The House accepts the need for the power to introduce extra-statutory concessions, but that power should be used as sparingly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1985, the Government have been committed to reduce the number of extra-statutory concessions whenever the possibility arose. There are 19 extra-statutory concessions relating to customs and excise, six of which relate to hydrocarbon oils, and the measure is designed to reduce that number. We have taken similar measures in other areas of customs duties, and I hope that the Committee will welcome the direction in which we are moving.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>ORIGINAL GRAVITY OF BEER</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 25, in page 3, line 33, at end insert—
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) The Customs and Excise shall publish figures for each brewery showing the amount of duty paid for each financial year beginning with 1989–90.".</p></blockquote>
The Economic Secretary made a helpful reply, and I am sure that the Opposition will table some questions to discover the amount of relief that is given in extra-statutory concessions. I agree that we should try to decrease their number and that we should put them on a regular basis. If the Government want to make further progress on that, the Opposition will support them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Economic Secretary explain what type of people are proper officers within the meaning of the Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979 and why the Government want to change the word "proper officer" to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"brewer in accordance with subsection (2)"?</p></blockquote>
The amendment is more specific. It was tabled because members of the Committee and the public should know how much duty is paid by each brewery. It would be useful to know whether the amount of duty paid will change because of the change in regulations. I read the press release put out by Customs and Excise which explained the changes in estimating duty—whether it is done by distillation analysis or whether it is done using a saccharometer. A full explanation of the changes—perhaps on the clause stand part debate—would be useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is straightforward. It seeks the publication of information, but commercial advantage or commercial secrecy will not be involved. Customs and Excise must know the figures and they should be made publicly available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the long-established policy of revenue Departments not to divulge the tax liabilities and payments of individual taxpayers. This well intentioned amendment would require them to do that. It would be against long established policy and, under clause 174, it would be a criminal offence to reveal the tax position of an individual. Consequently, the Government are reluctant to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was my understanding that a proper officer or a brewer would not be acting in an individual capacity, but would be acting on behalf of a company. Have I got that wrong?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whatever the capacity of the proper officer and the brewer, if Customs and Excise were required to reveal the tax affairs of an individual brewery it would be against previous policy, the provisions of the Bill and criminal law. It would also probably be against the Official Secrets Act at present. The role of proper officers does not alter that position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be pertinent to ask the Economic Secretary whether the clause will be affected by the report from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. There will be great changes throughout the industry and the clause will affect what happens in the industry if it goes through unamended.

	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 26, in page 3, line 37, leave out from "the" to end of Clause and add "1st April 1990".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the spirit of co-operation that has so far prevailed, I shall not take too long with this amendment. We were not sure of the implications of the change from proper officer to brewer. If a brewer measures the volume of alcohol upon which duty is to be paid he could, as a gamekeeper, turn poacher. I do not impugn the integrity of any brewers and I am sure that regulations could be drawn up to allow the brewer, competently and without risk of abuse, to measure and pay proper duty to the Customs and Excise. I just wonder whether proper officers used to be Customs and Excise officers who will now be made redundant and whether brewers will carry this out on their own. We are slightly worried about that. If the new system is introduced—the Government have a majority, and if they want it they will get it—there ought to be a reasonable interval of time before the change is made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fact, the changes made in this clause merely clarify the good and accepted practice of brewers at present. It will not require any significant change in the way they operate. The reason for the reference to proper officers and replacement by brewers is that formerly Customs and Excise officers were stationed in the brewery and carried out the checks themselves. For some while it has been the practice that brewers make the measurements. They are responsible for it and are required to do it correctly. They are subject to spot checks from visiting Customs and Excise officers who check worts that they have measured and see that they have been correctly measured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this clause we merely specify that the hire of the saccharometer and the distillation reading will apply. As I say, that is by and large what brewers are doing, but it is not unambiguously clear from the existing legislation that that is what is required of them. We do not think that they will have any difficulty in adapting to this legislation within the timescale specified prior to the amendment. Brewers have welcomed the clarification and affirmation that they should continue to do what they have been doing. There should be no further delay in that becoming an effective part of the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having listened to the Economic Secretary's explanation and assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While we are considering the proper officers and examining the specific gravity of worts,
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
we should also consider why this clause is the first in the section entitled, "Alcoholic liquor duties". Clauses 3, 4 and 5 are the only clauses dealing with alcoholic liquor duties in the Bill. The Government have confined their proposals to matters such as the definition of the original gravity of beer because they are absolutely terrified of changing the excise duty on alcohol, the vehicle excise duty and the duty on tobacco. They are terrified because the rate of inflation is rising so rapidly that they cannot contemplate adding even a tiny fraction of a percentage point to the retail price index as they would do if the duty paid under the clause were to be increased at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Government consulted widely on clause 3, but did they consult the committee of Ministers, chaired by the Leader of the House—the Lord President of the Council—which considers all matters of alcohol policy? That committee would surely have said that the clause, and the two subsequent clauses, is an inadequate response to the alcohol crisis and to the fact that the real price of alcohol has gone down drastically. It is about 50 per cent. or more cheaper than 30 years ago. The Treasury estimated that increases in duty have a measurable capacity to reduce the consumption of alcohol. The Government owe it to us to explain why the Bill does so little about alcohol problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's policy, which was stated widely, was not to control the outlets and licensing hours, but to use the price and tax system mechanisms. In three out of the past four Budgets, the Government have declined to update the duties on alcohol. Unless they can provide another explanation, that is an extraordinary abandonment of duty. We all know that that has an effect on the retail price index, which is now out of control. It would be remiss of the Committee to pass over this part of the Bill without drawing attention to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to back up fully the points made by the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith). We have an idea of the economic problems facing the Government when they are scared of putting up the excise duties on alcohol and tobacco, despite the advice from the Ministers responsible for health and from others that such a move would help to improve the health of the country. One or two hon. Members in this Committee were on the Licensing Amendment (Scotland) Bill yesterday. That was a small Bill to restrict the sale of alcohol for under-18s. That was trivial compared with what the Chancellor could have done in ensuring that the price of alcohol increased at least in line with inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that Committee yesterday, we examined a series of social engineering measures by the Government that sought to ensure that the taxation system was used for valid social purposes. The problem of alcoholism has been sadly neglected, so that we now have a Considerable alcohol abuse problem in this country. It is a great pity that the Budget was not used to make an impact in areas such as criminality, family troubles that contribute to rent arrears, and problems that contribute substantially to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0017">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
inefficiencies at the work place. The Government have failed this year to consider the social purposes to which excise duties could be put.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That issue has been inadequately covered in our debates so far. I think that the Government are embarrassed by the fact that their own economic difficulties have prevented them from imposing extra excise duties this year. I hope that the Economic Secretary will deal with those issues in a way that other Treasury Ministers have not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) and the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith). The Bill contains no clauses about the rate of duty on tobacco products or alcohol. Clearly, the reason is that the Government are so worried about inflation and the economic problems facing them that they have abandoned the sensible policy of valorising increases in tobacco duty. Unfortunately, they are storing trouble for themselves later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although there are two other clauses on alcoholic liquor duties, it would have been better had the Government included some increase in the duty on alcohol. The public would have understood the reasons for doing so—it would not have been contentious, but simply the result of inflation. To keep the duty the same simply betrays the Government's extreme sensitivity to inflation, the economy and the fact that they have only one club and use interest rates to try to keep the economy under control. At present they are walking on a tightrope and it will take a brave man to forecast whether they will come out of the problem well, or whether the situation will get completely out of control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we do not propose to vote against the clause as we do not object to its contents. It is simply a pity that other provisions could not have been included in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) rightly said that the clause has no bearing on the alcohol problem that exists in this country, or on the level of excise duty on alcohol. Therefore, I shall not risk your wrath, Mr. Crowther, by trying to discuss those matters. Suffice to say that a later clause has a bearing on the measure that the Government took in the previous Budget to try to remove disabilities in marketing low and zero-alcohol drinks. The Government have taken that constructive measure recently and we hope that the trade can build on it. The absolute level of duty on beer in real terms has risen considerably in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) asked whether the clause had a bearing on the MMC report. I am afraid that I see no connection or possible
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
interaction between the two, but we await the decision of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry as to how he proposes to respond to that report. The purpose of the clause is to clarify the law so that it is clearly established that where there is any difference between the Saccharometer reading and the distillation analysis reading, the higher of the two shall apply. That is already largely implemented by the breweries so it will not make much difference to them. It is necessary because of a change in brewing practice whereby the yeast is introduced into the works earlier than used to be the case so that fermentation may begin earlier. It is sensible to recognise these changing practices and the industry largely welcomes the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's refusal to plead the charge put to him and his determination to take refuge in a later clause—I imagine that he is referring to clause 5—underlines the fact that the Government are not facing up to the issue. On clause 5 we can discuss the merits of a single useful proposal. The Government are not taking the issue seriously if they think that they have the answer to the problems of alcohol abuse, which is involved in 50 per cent. of murders, a large proportion of child abuse, suicides, drowning, domestic accidents, serious head injuries and road accidents. This is the first of three clauses that has any bearing on the problem. The Government seem to have abandoned heir duty of keeping up-to-date in tackling this range of problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now come to the second clause on alcohol. Our amendment is simple. I suspect that the clause has been included because of pressure from Spanish sherry producers and that the Government felt that they were in danger of being taken to the European Court, so thought they should introduce legislation to forestall that. I realise that we have a treaty
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0018">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
obligation not only to be in conformity with the rules of the Common Market, but to be so as quickly and conveniently as possible. It could also be that the industry foresaw that something like this would happen, because of similar provisions for other types of alcohol products introduced into Finance Bills in previous years. Nevertheless, I should have thought that we could have given the industry until 1 April 1990, after seeing the clause in the Finance Bill this April.

I accept that the European Commission has a role and has to check that different countries apply the rules fairly, but British sherry always has a much lower strength than French sherry. Ordinary sherry is perhaps 20 deg Gay-Lussac. Will the Economic Secretary tell us what the strength of British sherry is? It is probably something between 12 deg and 15 deg. I wonder whether the rate bands could be changed to overcome the problem and satisfy the sherry producers of Spain. That may be irrelevant to the amendment, but if we cannot discuss it now, we shall have to discuss it under clause stand part.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

Therefore, the trade has been aware for some time that the practice of duty-paid blending would have to come to an end, and it has already taken steps to minimise the impact. By and large, it no longer indulges in duty-paid blending, but produces the wine at 14.9 per cent. or less than the 15 per cent. threshold at which a higher rate of duty becomes applicable. In those circumstances, it does not need a longer period of notice between Budget day and Royal Assent than the amendment proposes.

	<div class='title'>DESCRIPTION AS BEER</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 28, in page 4, line 16, at beginning insert "(1) In".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With amendment No. 28, we shall also consider amendment No. 29, in page 4, line 18, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall cease to have effect"</p></blockquote>
and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"subsection (1), the words 'duty chargeable on beer' shall be replaced by the words 'appropriate rate of duty chargeable.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(2) In subsection 4, the words 'penalty of £100' shall be replaced by the words 'penalty of amount represented by level 3 on the standard scale or a penalty of three times the value of any goods in respect of the contravention or failure, whichever is the greater.'.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments are indeed linked. I must say at the outset that I am not absolutely sure that the Opposition are right in this amendment, but no doubt the Economic Secretary will tell us whether we are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is difficult. It is clearly desirable to encourage the drinking of beer of a lower alcoholic content. However, it is also clearly desirable that the consumer should know exactly what product he or she is buying. I fear that if the clause is passed unamended, it will result in consumers losing rights and being unable easily to perceive whether what they are buying contains any alcohol and whether it is a light ale or lager—what could be known as a light beer—an ordinary British lager with a specific gravity of 1030 to 1033, a stronger ale or bitter of 1040, or even a continental-style lager with a specific gravity of 1048 or 1050.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that there are existing regulations which necessitate the printing of the specific gravity on every bottle of ale or lager that is sold. Often, those figures are small and difficult to see. Sometimes they are easy to see when there is a selling point to them, but often one has to search on a can of lager for a long time before one can discover what type it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the present Act makes an exception for black beer—I do not know whether any of my hon. Friend's can enlighten me on what black beer is—and for ginger beer. I do not quarrel with that, because everyone knows that ginger beer does not contain alcohol. Whatever we may think about the advisability of informing consumers about the level of alcohol, consumers have a right to know and the information should be given. If I buy beer, I know that it contains a certain amount of alcohol, but such information will no longer be given to consumers. We are in a quandary because we want to encourage people to drink liquids containing less alcohol than beers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill provides that section 73 of the Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall cease to have effect."</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 29 attempts to widen the definition to allow anything on which duty is paid to be called "beer". That would include light ales or beer of low specific gravity with only 0.9 per cent. alcohol. Anything with less than 0.1 per cent. alcohol would still not be called "beer". If the Economic Secretary has any suggestions on how to get round that problem, we shall all be prepared to listen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Customs and Excise news release 35/89 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"no excise duty is payable on low alcohol beers with an alcoholic strength not exceeding 1.2 per cent."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
If that is so, the amendment would not be effective and would need to be widened. It would need to insert figures to the effect that anything that has more than a minimal amount of alcohol in it can be called beer. I am worried that by sweeping away section 73 we would open the floodgates to confusion for consumers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am hoping to stimulate the Minister into giving the Committee an explanation, because this area puzzles me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that, under the present regulations, although low-alcohol beers cannot be called beers, they have been marketed as beers. Customs and Excise has not taken exception to that because it collected the duty on them. I can see from the expression on the Minister's face that I have got that wrong. Nevetheless, the brewers charged a price for those low alcohol beers that was pitched as if it included excise duty. Low alcohol beers have been profitable because brewers have taken advantage of the public's ignorance and have charged a price that is not justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, too, that the Minister can explain the implications for section 73 of the Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979. My hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) used the strange term, which none of us recognised, of black beer. From the description, it seems to be a beer with a specific gravity of 1200 deg or more, which is very powerful. I wonder whether it is what is sometimes called barley wine, which is the only beer I know of that strength. That gives rise to another difficulty of terminology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister comment on ginger beer, which is not beer at all but is allowed to be called such. Will that be affected by the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can put the Committee out of its agony. Black beer is, as the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) correctly said, barley wine of more than 1200 deg. I am told by my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mrs. Shephard) that in Norfolk it is known as Norfolk nips. It is a minor product with only limited sales, mainly in the north and Norfolk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) asked how the consumer could know the strength of beers. Probably from July this year, regulations will require the strength of alcoholic drinks to be shown on the bottle. That is already done voluntarily in most cases so that people know the strength of those drinks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie asked me to explain the background to the clause. It is interesting. Section 73 was introduced in 1932 at the Report stage of the Finance Bill. Although it was described as a revenue protection measure, clearly it was a trade protection measure which prohibited traders from selling low alcohol substances of 1.2 per cent. or less in strength and calling them beer. The brewers were worried about unfair competition, as they saw it, from such products which did not bear
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
excise duty prior to that and the sales of which had been rising following the 1931 increase in duties. At the time, the Government supported that provision, presumably in the interests of minimising the erosion of the duty base through consumers substituting such low strength beers for beer of dutiable strength.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Personally, I think that taxation law is no longer appropriate, if it ever was so, as a method of controlling the misdescription of drinks or, in general, as a form of consumer protection. The appropriate vehicle for that is the Trade Descriptions Act which contains provisions to ensure that goods, including drinks, are described in accurate, not misleading terms. Therefore, section 73 is not needed for consumer protection. To require Customs and Excise to enforce it which, as was rightly said, it has actively not done, would involve it in work and regulatory effort that is probably better carried out by trading standards officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 29 refers to a "level 3" penalty. In fact, the penalty has already been raised to £400, which is the level 3 penalty, so the amendment would not make a change in that respect. There is an appropriate penalty when required. Therefore, given the origins of section 73 as well as its present operation, perhaps the Opposition will not wish to associate themselves with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the Economic Secretary said what he did. But the problem is often that when making legislation in Committee it is said that a matter is for trading standards officers, or whoever, and so nothing is done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pertinent to this debate is an article in 	<i>The Guardian</i> of 4 May which caught my eye. I shall read extracts from it because it shows what will happen, unless we are careful:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Food stores and manufacturers are often failing to list the amount of sugar, fat, salt, and other nutrients on packages, more than a year after government guidelines urged companies to supply the information, the Consumers' Association said yesterday.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Marks & Spencer was singled out for criticism in a survey of food labels published in Which? magazine.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>More than half of the St Michael products surveyed contained no nutritional information."</p></blockquote>
It went on to say that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Marks and Spencer did not dispute the survey's findings yesterday. It said packaged food would be fully labelled by the end of 1989, in accordance with EEC guidelines issued in November 1988."</p></blockquote>
The problem is that people have the best of intentions, and in a perfect world the matter could be left to trading standards officers—and may well be left to them. Will the Economic Secretary give an undertaking that he will consult his colleagues in the Department of Trade and Industry to ensure that the regulations insisting on the proper labelling of specific gravity will do so in such a way that the specific gravity of the liquid is obvious to every consumer? If the labelling were clear and big enough for shortsighted people to read, that would be a suitable compromise, and the matter could be left to trading standards officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But Opposition Members remain worried because we know that big chain stores are a law unto themselves in this modern world. They open on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0020">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
Sundays when they should not be open; they do not display nutritional information on their packages when they should; and I fear that if we dispense with section 73, they will start to sell all sorts of products, pretending that they contain this, that or the other, which they may or may not contain. The sad fact of experience leads me to press the Economic Secretary to have a word with his colleagues in the Department of Trade and Industry to see whether the regulations are good enough to ensure that the consumer will not be confused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fact, the regulations emanate from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food—in other words, MAFF. I am sure that they are adequate, but I shall look into the matter and acquaint myself and the hon. Member for Wrexham with the relevant details. I am sure that it will be a more satisfactory system than requiring Customs and Excise to enforce a trading standards definition of a product on which they do not collect duty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the spirit of the Economic Secretary's remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to vehicle excise duty. Those hon. Members who have served on previous Finance Bill Committees will know that we have considered the issue, though not necessarily at great length. Nevertheless, it is an important matter and one which is primarily the responsibility of the Department of Transport. Changes have been made in the excise duty that is paid by various groups of vehicles, and I hope that the Economic Secretary—or whoever is replying to this debate—will tell us about the present state of play in respect of different vehicles and different axles and how they cover their track costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have here a Department of Transport booklet entitled
	<br><blockquote><p>"The allocation of road track costs 1988/89 United Kingdom".</p></blockquote>
It is a useful booklet, because it shows the state of play. On page 8, there is a table showing
	<br><blockquote><p>"Goods vehicles over 1.525 tonnes unladen: annual kilometres per vehicle, road costs and road taxation in 1988/89: by goods vehicle subclass".</p></blockquote>
One column on road costs shows that rigid 3-axle vehicles of over 23 tonnes pay £3,837 annually per vehicle, and rigid 4-axle vehicles of over 29 tonnes pay £5,911. Table 9 on page 9 deals with road taxes, and has a very informative column showing taxes minus costs per vehicle. They are all reasonably similar, but I wonder whether the figures are right,
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
because the 29-tonne 4-axle vehicles seem to pay a lot more than other vehicles, which seems rather unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary may recall that last year I argued the other way. I said that those vehicles were not paying enough for the damage that they do to the roads—:[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman but I fear that some hon.

Members must talk privately, will they please do so at a subdued tone or in the corridor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for quoting tables of figures. I intend to continue in the spirit of co-operation and keep my remarks to the minimum. I wonder whether the road costs include maintenance. The charges in clause 6 are based on the Department of Transport booklet. The table of maintenance costs on page 5 of that booklet includes reconstructing and resurfacing of roads, haunching, surface dressing, skid treatments, drainage, traffic signs, pedestrian crossings, road markings, winter maintenance and miscellaneous and street lighting. Police costs are not included. I suspect that they are included somewhere but they do not come under maintenance of roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ambulance and accident costs are not included. Are they included as part of the police costs? Are heavy, rigid, 3 and 4-axle vehicles at the top end of their class unfairly taxed compared to other vehicles? How much reliance can the Economic Secretary put on this table?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Research on environmental damage other than to the Department of Transport or the county councils was carried out in Holland and the figures produced were startling. Much damage is done by heavy vehicles when they go past buildings. The buildings may shake and their foundations may become unsettled or their plaster may have to be replaced more often. The cost of much of the damage is borne not by the Government or local authorities but by the householders or the owners of the properties that those vehicles pass. A cost—not a track cost—should be imposed on lorries for the damage that they cause. That important point has not previously been considered in this country. I am sorry to spring it on the Economic Secretary, but I should like to know what he thinks about the matter and whether he thinks that it is a genuine problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the problem of overweight lorries. They often come from busy ports such as Dover.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dover)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must defend the port of Dover where lorries are weighed very carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always keen to hear from Conservative Members, and perhaps the hon. Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw) can help us. Is every lorry weighed when it leaves the port? My understanding is that there are difficulties in doing that because the police cannot interfere with a lorry when it comes into port off a ship because it is on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0021">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
private land. Lorries might be overweight, they might not have paid vehicle excise duty and they might not have a licence to go on the roads of this country. But if my understanding is correct, the police cannot do anything about that until lorries move on to the road. Dover is a busy port and there is not much room at the point where lorries leave the eastern dock. It is impossible for the police to operate any checks there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unhappy because I have heard that a third of the lorries leaving Dover are overweight. Is that true? If it is not true, I hope that the hon. Member for Dover will enlighten us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman would accept that it is not only a matter of checking lorries at the port, important though that is. Some overweight lorries are picked up at other points—for example, the Department of Transport weighbridge at Crick on the M1 in my constituency, where a fairly healthy harvest is gathered. It would be wrong to concentrate our efforts at the ports, and we should continue to try to pick them up at all appropriate points in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right, but that is very much second best. It would be far better to enforce the law in the certainty that overweight lorries or those that do not have the proper licence will be caught. That will stop them coming to Dover by boat. It is better to do that instead of allowing them to cross half the country, ruining the roads on the way, before they reach the hon. Gentleman's constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should slightly correct an impression that I might have given earlier. Before the lorries enter the country, we rely on the French and their effectiveness in going on board the ferries to weigh the lorries. As we know from the past 1,000 years, there are weaknesses in relying on Frenchmen. However, I have some good news. We do not have to rely solely on Frenchmen—and they have improved their reliability recently—because we have an excellent police force in Kent. Every Monday, as I drive up the A2 to the House of Commons, I see large numbers of policemen who have stopped many lorries that are suspect or overweight. Although the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) may exaggerate by suggesting that one in three lorries is overweight, there is still a problem and the police in Kent are enforcing the law as effectively as they can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I find this discussion absolutely fascinating, but I am not sure what it has to do with the rate of vehicle excise duty. That is what the clause is about, and it would help if we stuck to that from now on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall bear what you say, Mr. Crowther, very much in mind. The Labour party may have had problems with Europe over the last 20 years but I suspect that the Tory party will have the problems from now on, certainly if the sentiments expressed by the hon. Member for Dover are shared by many of his fellow Tory Back Benchers—as I suspect they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
Vehicle excise duty is important as a means whereby revenue is gathered for the maintenance of roads. If everyone paid it properly and in full we would not be so concerned about where the money comes from for the maintenance of our roads, roundabouts and so on. The problem is one of overweight vehicles which pay a lower rate of vehicle excise duty than they should or are too overweight even to be allowed on the roads. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Dover was suggesting this but it would be a good idea—could we not get the ferry owners to weigh the vehicles on each side of the Channel? I am happy to co-operate with the French and I am sure the French would co-operate with us. A certificate confirming that each vehicle was underweight and eligible to use the roads could be provided by the ferry operator. That could solve all the problems the police have in tracking down overweight lorries. It is a sensible suggestion and I would be interested to hear what the Economic Secretary has to say about it. Perhaps he could get the Department of Transport to explore the matter with the ferry companies in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My one further point about vehicle excise duty relates to the ratio of revenue to costs. I have a table from the Department of Transport which is based on the methodology first set out in its "Road Track Costs" report of 1968. According to the table, the ratio of revenue to costs of cars, light vans and taxis is 3.4:1 of buses and coaches it is 0.9:1, of goods vehicles under 3.5 tonnes it is 3.0:1 and of goods vehicles over 3.5 tonnes it is 1.1:1. The interesting point is that the ratio is highest for cars, light vans and taxis. The average car owner is not only covering his or her track costs but paying in the ratio of 3.4:1 over them whereas the really big lorry is only just covering them. The Government still have some way to go to create a level playing field.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend think that the Government are introducing a new strategy for the use of the tax here and that they will now relate the burden it places on vehicles to their use on the road in a systematic way as opposed to the ad hoc fashion that has existed until now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I invite the Government to develop their policy. Until now, it was that every vehicle must cover its track costs. That happens with all vehicles, apart from buses. Why should the average motorist get stung and be penalised more than the owners of other classes of vehicles that use the roads? There should be fair play. I hope that the ratio of 3.4:1 could come down a little and that the ratio of 1.1:1 for goods vehicles over 3.5 tonnes could go up a little. Goods vehicles not over 3.5 tonnes already have a ratio of 3:1. That is not perfect science. I should be interested in what my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) has to say about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much doubt about whether heavy goods vehicles cover both their track costs and environmental costs. The average motorist thinks that he or she is paying through the nose in taxation. That is true, but I doubt that the Government or Opposition would ever say that vehicle taxation
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0022">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
should be confined simply to roads and transport. It is a long-established principle that vehicle taxation provides revenue for the Treasury and equity should be involved. The average motorist, with an ordinary family car, pays far more over his or her share of track costs than the owner of a heavy lorry over 3.5 tonnes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made many points. I apologise if I have taken longer than usual over them, but I cut down my argument to the bare minimum. I am interested in the Economic Secretary's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has asked many questions. He asked about the position of different groups and their costs. The Government's objective has been to ensure that each category of vehicles covers fully the costs that it imposes through the vehicle excise duty that it pays. The latest changes reaffirm that policy by requiring that the new rates of duty ensure that buses and coaches cover fully their track costs, which they did not always do in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wrexham asked whether those track costs include policing costs, which they do, and whether they include accident costs, which they do not. He asked about the non-public cost—the disturbance to people caused by heavy lorries shaking their houses. That is not covered. I say that with feeling as I have been kept awake for all 10 of the past few nights that I have spent in my London dormitory—I hope that the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) is taking note—due a poor trench reinstatement in a main road which is causing heavy lorries to fly through the air and land noisily outside my bedroom window. That is why I look rather haggard at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, South and Finsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the problem that the Minister is experiencing outside his front door, he will doubtless support my continuous efforts to get the Metropolitan police to enforce the night-time and weekend lorry ban, implemented initially by the Greater London council, whose activities he must surely have supported.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are moving away from the rate of vehicle excise duty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is a case of poor trench reinstatement, which I trust will be rectified when I send the Committee's proceedings to the relevant quarters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked whether the damage done by overweight lorries is reflected in duty calculations. The formula is complex. Hon. Members will remember that last year the Committee discussed whether it should adhere to the fourth or fifth power law, and we concluded that the fourth power law was right. That means that the weight per axel is summed, raised to the fourth power and divided by 10,000 to calculate the measure of the damage done by heavy lorries. In so doing, the Department of Transport assesses the actual weight carried by lorries—not the theoretical legal maximum that they should carry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department of Transport has road stops to assess whether vehicles are adhering to all its regulations, including weight regulations. It has road stops outside Dover which, following the Committee's deliberations last year, take into account whether vehicles are properly licensed. That issue has not been raised this year, although it was one of the successes of the Committee's activities last year. Appropriate efforts are made to ensure that vehicles are not overloaded, but it would be wrong to rely on private shipping companies to carry out such a policing function.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are still on clause 6 stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of clause 6 is five-fold. First, it it reduces the number of tax bands for hackney carriages—a quaint term comprising taxis, buses and coaches—from over 60 to just five, which is a considerable clarification and simplification. Secondly, it removes the anomaly whereby taxis, buses and coaches with fewer than 66 seats pay less vehicle excise duty than private cars, and it ensures that new bus and coach bands fully cover their track costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, we shall introduce a new clause later to allow community buses—many of which are run by charitable organisations—operating on non-commercial routes to register as private light goods vehicles, which will require only £100 in vehicle excise duty. That is not covered by clause 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the clause increases the rates for the heaviest rigid goods vehicles by about 10 per cent., bringing their tax yield relative to track cost further in line with that of articulated vehicles. Fourthly, it increases the vehicle excise duties for special types—vehicles used to move abnormal loads—in line with rates paid by the equivalent heavy goods vehicles. Fifthly, it increases trade licence rates in line with rates paid by private cars and motorcycles. Those measures will be of value and are in line with the general tenor of the debate so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the 10 per cent. increase on the 170,000 rigid goods vehicles is the beginning of a new policy, in as much as the Government wish to increase the ratio of revenue to costs for heavy goods vehicles compared with private cars, light vans, taxis and so on. If so, I applaud the measure, as, apart from the arguments about what should be calculated as part of the real cost of heavy goods vehicles on the roads, there are all the other arguments about the non-financial damage done by heavy goods vehicles as they travel through congested towns close to houses at the roadside. Do the Government intend to increase those duties as part of a general policy to make heavy goods vehicles pay much more?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In general we are in the business of levelling duties. The clause specifically levels the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0023">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
duties paid by rigid goods vehicles to make them more comparable with track costs of those paid by articulated goods vehicles. That is the general direction of what the hon. Gentleman said, but we are not raising the total of both articulated and rigid vehicles relative to their track costs at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If clause 6 is a move towards a form of road pricing, would not it be more sensible to cast off its rather anonymous disguise in the clause? If the disguise were cast off, the public would understand more clearly the Government's thinking on the matter. I am worried about our own amendment on the matter, as I do not want to see the price of manufactured and road-hauled goods rise because of increased taxes on vehicles. On the economic periphery of the nation we suffer enough from the problems of overcrowded roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government could consider the place of taxation in a more clearly focussed way in the list of possible modifications that could be made to the transportation system. For example, instead of hiking up the taxes on heavy vehicles, perhaps they could consider restricting them to motorways, specially-designated trunk roads and so on, as in some continental countries. The Government could then allow the public to see their strategy more clearly than the clause allows at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not going to treat the debate as Question Time. However, perhaps I could use the debate on subsequent amendments to refer to the hon. Gentleman's points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are getting matters more in order. I hope that the Treasury will keep an eye on this matter, not with a view to penalising heavy lorries, but with a view to equity between the different classes of vehicles. Certainly there is agreement on both sides of the Committee that there should be equity between the different numbers of axles and different weights in relation to HGVs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sought to ask the Treasury whether it is fair that the ratio of revenue costs should be so disparate for the different classes of vehicles, that they should be 3.4:1 for cars and lights vans, 3:1 for goods vehicles not over 3½ tonnes but only 1.1:1 for goods vehicles over 3½ tonnes. The points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) are valid. Nearly everywhere on the continent lorries are restricted to certain roads at certain times, and to certain parking places. It is high time that we introduced such a scheme here, though that is not a matter for this debate. It is more properly a matter for the Department of Transport to consider. However, if the Economic Secretary will bear in mind what has been said, in our debate in a year's time I hope that the Treasury will be able to demonstrate that further progress has been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The track costs of bus companies for buses were not covered in the table to which I referred in the previous debate, so some increase was necessary. However, the increase proposed by the Government is too much, too stringent, and has been made too quickly. We are not against the principle that vehicles must cover their track costs. We are greatly in favour of it. Buses perform a public service and in certain areas subsidies must necessarily be given to bus operators to enable them to provide that service, but it is not part of the Revenue's job to provide the subsidy. It is the job of the Department of Transport and part of any Government's public policy. Needless to say, the policy of the Labour party would be different from the policy of this Government, but that is not at issue here. The increase has been too stringent and could have been phased in. That is the purpose of our amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Government can explain some of their philosophy. Given the congestion on our roads, particularly in this part of the country, it seems strange that the Government should make a proposal under the guise of vehicle excise duty which would appear at the very least to discourage rather than encourage public transport. Some of the increases are swingeing. One would have expected discussion with the Department of Transport on the lines of, "What is our policy on public transport? Do we want to encourage it or not?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer particularly to the problems that are now being experienced by many bus companies following the deregulation of buses. The profit margins on which some of them are operating are small. It is inevitably a consequence of competition policy that some will go to the wall. In Scotland, a large number of bus companies started up at the time of privatisation and deregulation, but that number is now diminishing. The mileage being covered is beginning to decrease as a consequence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other day I was looking at the local regional council's costs for subsidised travel. They are mounting rapidly as more and more bus companies come and say that they can no longer afford to run their service on a commercial basis. The consequence of increasing the vehicle excise duty may simply be to transfer expenditure to subsidised bus services being run by local authorities. The Government must explain what their policy is. This increase is the sort of increase that the Government put forward in a Budget speech, but do not link to their general transport policy, and we must ask the Economic Secretary to take upon himself the burden of explaining what the Government's transport policy is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0024">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
That is linked to another anxiety. In recent years there has been a considerably greater use of minibuses than large buses to bring services to more inaccessible parts or to areas where the density of travel is not so great, or even sometimes into areas where buses have not been able to go before. People, particularly elderly people, are then linked with the general population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that the increase in minibuses is considerable and rapid. The impact on a minibus of a certain percentage increase is much greater because it has far fewer seats to cover the cost of the service. Therefore, any fare increase will be greater because the proportionate increase must be shared among fewer people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The gist of my remarks is that bus travel is heavily concentrated among the less prosperous. Those who do not have their own or company cars are reliant on bus travel. The Bus and Coach Council, which represents the industry, reckons that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the increase in duty will add around £20 million to operating costs and lead to 10 per cent. of the national fleet being laid up."</p></blockquote>
Clearly, there is a tendency of such representative bodies to exaggerate the impact and I doubt whether that will be the outcome. But the impact will certainly be damaging because of the Government's policy. It should be remembered that before the Government's action many bus companies had made substantial fare increases, regardless of the increase in duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Economic Secretary, in his helpful way, step outside the normal bounds of his duties to say how the Treasury reaches such a decision, when common sense suggests that we must stimulate more public travel, especially by bus, and not less?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) was about to suggest not that the Minister stepped outside his normal duties but out of his ministerial car to take the bus, which would probably be educative and would certainly save the taxpayer a great deal of money. Instead of paying for his car, we could simply provide him with a bus pass or refund him his bus fares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie was right to underline the high dependence on bus travel of those on the lowest incomes. The Government should keep under constant consideration the balance between public and private transport. The Government have not been frightened to tackle what is, politically, quite a difficult issue—the taxpayers' subsidy of the company car. But they should also try to ensure that public transport is not made unnecessarily expensive and, indeed, that it is made as widely available as possible. That has implications for a whole range of policy, especially for the railways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, bus services are a vital part of our public transport system. This is not the place to discuss all the complexities of deregulation and its consequences. That involves a complex series of arguments, and far too much black and white ideological talk has taken place about the merits and demerits of deregulation. Other things have
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
happened in the bus industry, some bad and some good. The worst thing would be artificially-increased prices, especially for those who are so dependent on bus services. The Minister should keep more clearly in mind that it is to the general advantage of the economy and of the social good if the price of public transport on buses is not forced upwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to pursue the theme of my earlier question and to ask whether the Treasury has calculated how much extra money will be brought in and what will be the ratio of revenue to costs for the various types of buses?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support what was said about the Government's increases. Although they are a part of simplification of the duties paid by buses, which I welcome, they have resulted in some extremely large increases in costs for some buses, especially the larger ones. I wonder whether the Government gave any consideration to introducing this simplification with lower increases. What would be the effect of the scaled-down list of duties proposed in amendment No. 54? Furthermore, have the Government given any thought to introducing a separate band for vehicles used exclusively, or mainly for the provision of regularly timetabled public service routes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important schedule. In my own constituency many smaller bus companies that were set up after deregulation have collapsed because of various costs. The line-up of companies now running bus routes is very much like that before deregulation. Although I was a later convert to deregulation, the savings that deregulation brought to communities such as those in my constituency are in danger of being lost as a result of the provision. As well as the effects that my hon. Friends have mentioned, there will be a further concentration of ownership of bus companies into fewer hands. That is not good for competition between bus companies in areas such as mine. It certainly has a detrimental effect on those who operate unprofitable bus routes, such as long or rural routes on which people depend so much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will look at the provision again, because it has serious implications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been asked to take on the additional role of Secretary of State for Transport, and I am happy to do so if that is the Committee's wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) asked whether the Government intended that the ratio between track costs and duties paid should be the same for all categories of vehicles. That is not our ambition. We accept that at present passenger transport, especially cars which have a much higher ratio, reflects the fact that duties are not levied simply to pay for the wear and tear that they incur on roads but as general revenue for the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) asked whether we should consciously try to reduce the burden on heavy goods vehicles in the light of its impact on the more far-flung parts of the kingdom where inevitably goods have a heavier
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0025">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
transport element. We recognise that by not wanting the 1:3.4 ratio that we have for motor cars. None the less, we believe that all categories of vehicles should cover their track costs through a combination of excise and fuel duties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Economic Secretary confirm that vehicles going to far-flung parts of the country have an advantage because an average mileage per lorry is built into the formula to calculate the amount of vehicle excise duty that lorries pay?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may have given the impression that everyone should pay the same ratio over and above track costs. I intended to ask for more equity. If it is accepted that cars should pay more—I was not arguing that they should not—how does the Economic Secretary view the disparity between lorries over and above 3.5 tonnes? Surely the same argument cannot apply to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Wrexham asked whether more far-flung areas benefited from the average mileage effect. I thought of making that point, but felt that I would be told that it was spurious, as although vehicles in those areas may pay less per mile, they have far more miles to do, so I said nothing. Perhaps my second thoughts were wise, even though I might have had the support of the hon. Member for Wrexham. I shall reply to his latter point in due course, when time has refreshed my memory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) spoke about the apparent inconsistency of increasing the duty on certain categories of hackney vehicles at a time when one would prefer to have vehicles carrying lots of people rathern than lots of vehicles carrying a few people. Our first principle must be that each category should more than cover its track costs. Secondly, ordinary motorists cannot understand why a 50-seat coach pays less duty in absolute terms than a family car. As we felt that that should provide a yardstick, the anomaly has been remedied, although the cost per seat is still far less than in a family car.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) mentioned the fuel subsidy that is paid to public service vehicles that follow regular routes and stop a certain number of times. They will retain that rebate on their fuel. There is no question of removing that subsidy, or of supplementing it with a parallel vehicle excise duty subsidy, because one subsidy is enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The total cost of the changes that we are making in respect of public service vehicles, hackney carriages, is ½p per vehicle per kilometre—less than 1 per cent. of the operating costs of the vehicles affected. It is small and will not produce anything like the effects that have been alleged by those who have an interest in emphasising the adverse effects of the changes. There is a clear, underlying pattern: first, all categories should cover their track costs; and secondly, we are right to concentrate on gaining revenue from individual's car, while retaining subsidies for public service vehicles in towns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell us the estimated income from vehicle excise duty this year
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
and in a full future year as a result of the impact of these charges?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The estimate is that the changes in the clause will increase duty by about £20 million. The amendment, if passed, would reduce it by £5 million, representing a reduction of more than 20 per cent. in rates of duty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is that £20 million as a proportionate increase?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The number is rather difficult to decypher. I expect it to be displayed in the way that reserves are called at football matches. I shall then be able to answer the question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I am waiting for that, I should point out that although there have been suggestions that we should alter the rate of vehicle excise duty to encourage the collective provision of transport facilities, such an alteration was ruled out by the hon. Member for Wrexham in a debate in the Finance Bill Committee in 1985, when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We should not use the argument that, as buses are a social service, VED on buses should be lower than it would be if buses were to cover their track costs."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 14 May 1985; c.71.]</p></blockquote>
There is a bipartisan view that buses should cover those costs and I welcome that. That may be jeopardised by the amendment, so I hope that it will not be pressed to a vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer is not quite applicable to the question. The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie wanted to know what the £20 million extra duty being raised was as a proportion of total duty, if we had not increased it. I suspect that it is very few per cent., but I shall write to the hon. Gentleman with the precise figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a good debate on the amendment. We will press it to a vote for two reasons. The first came from my hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington), and my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd also mentioned it. They said that any increase in taxation should be accompanied by policies which seek to protect public service transport. That is what the Government have signally failed to do. Deregulation has provided better services in some areas but much worse services in others. It has also destroyed many good full-time jobs for people who were able to bring up a family without wondering where they would find next week's wages to pay the bills. Public service transport should be able to cover track costs. There is no quibble about that. There should be a social policy as a corollary, but the Government do not have one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second principle about which we are unhappy is that the increases are large and a good Government do not make swingeing increases in taxation without warning to allow the industry to adjust. Ours is a moderate party compared with the Conservatives. Our amendment seeks to improve the provision and we will insist upon it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The provision in the Finance Act 1987 that defined recovery vehicles as trucks designed to tow or carry away broken vehicles contained a drafting error which allowed the carriage of goods by vehicles registered in this concessionary class.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 30 in page 5, line 32, leave out paragraph (b).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment. We are now discussing the part of the Bill which deals with the assignment of registration marks from one vehicle to another, and we have tabled a great many amendments to clause 10. The Government must be hard up for money if they have to flog registration marks to raise cash.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that there are people willing to buy registration marks, although it is beyond me why they want them. Pehaps someone can explain during the debate. I am sure that some Conservative Members have special registration marks for their vehicles. The chief Secretary to the Treasury is shaking his head. I am glad to see that he is sane on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 9(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may, in such circumstances as he may determine …</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) assign to a vehicle (whether on its first registration or not) a registration mark previously assigned to another vehicle."</p></blockquote>
I am worried that assignments could be made quickly. One reason for having registration marks on vehicles is to ensure that there is no doubt about a vehicle's identification if there is an accident or if it needs to be traced—unless, of course, it has false number plates. I wish to be clear that no difficulties will be created for the police, the ambulance, fire services or anyone else if registration marks are transferred from one vehicle to another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assuer the hon. Gentleman that there are no such dangers. Numbers will not be shuffled about like pingpong balls. The clause only clarifies the Secretary of State's existing powers to assign registration marks to vehicles and to transfer registration marks on request. The clause sets out the powers clearly in legislation for the first time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would strike at the heart of the process and remove a power that the Secretary of State almost certainly has at present. Primarily it is to move registration marks from vehicles that are out of use—they may no longer exist but were assigned in the deep and distant past—to current vehicles when that is required by both parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My theme throughout these clauses is that the Secretary of State must tell us what he is doing, to whom he is assigning number plates and how much he gets from the Treasury for those number plates,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0027">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
because the public want to know. They know in other countries where it is done. I hope that the number plates will not be sold at commercially—confidential prices. If the number plates were sold, the popular press would have an enormous amount of copy, there would be constant issues of interest and the public should know about it.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments are more substantial and should be considered more seriously. The first issue is the power that the Secretary of State takes if the clause stands part of the Bill. Amendment No. 31 seeks to replace "may" by "shall". Provision should be made for some of the paragraphs (a) to (k) that are not amended later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 32 seeks to delete in line 20 the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"on such grounds as he thinks fit".</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State should not have such a power. It could be said that it is a trivial power and that nothing will go wrong if he has it, but regulations should authorise the Secretary of State, if there is a case, to refuse an application, not on such grounds as the Secretary of State thinks fit. It is an almost untrammelled power, a prerogative of the Secretary of State. The Government, with their large majority, are given to taking huge powers. The regulations should spell out clearly if the Secretary of State can be given the power to refuse in any case. It should not give him an unwarranted power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 33 seeks to delete paragraph (f), another untrammelled power for the Secretary of State
	<br><blockquote><p>"for enabling the period referred to in subsection (1) above to be extended by the Secretary of State if he thinks fit in the circumstances of any particular case".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
Subsection (1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by regulations provide for a person in whose name a vehicle is registered to be granted a right, exercisable on a single occasion falling within a specified period, to have the registration mark for the time being assigned to the vehicle assigned to some other vehicle".</p></blockquote>
I do not see why we cannot have regulations that are absolutely clear cut, so that everybody who wants to assign a registration mark from one vehicle to another may understand exactly what they mean. Why should there be exceptions to allow the Secretary of State to act as he thinks fit? Any exceptions should be spelt out in the regulations, although I accept that the Government may intend them to be spelt out when they draft the regulations. If that is so, I should be glad to hear about it but, if not, it is a prerogative that the Secretary of State should not have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
8.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 34 and 35 relate to the power of the Secretary of State to revoke a right of retention
	<br><blockquote><p>"if it appears to him that there are special reasons for doing so".</p></blockquote>
Again, those "special reasons" should be spelt out in the regulations and the Secretary of State should not have the absolute right to decide whether or not there are "special reasons". The Secretary of State should be allowed to revoke a right of retention but only, as is stated in line 37, "in specified circumstances" which should be stated in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also discussing amendment No. 36 which deals with much the same theme. Clause 10(2)(k) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"with respect to such incidental, consequential or supplemental matters as appear to the Secretary of State to be necessary or expedient for the purposes of the regulations."</p></blockquote>
Anything that appears to the Secretary of State to be "necessary or expedient" should be specified in the regulations and if it is not, the regulations should be changed. I am not sure whether they have to come before Parliament for debate, but it would be right if they were so debated because the House of Commons would like to consider any changes that may be proposed from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of the amendments relate to the same theme of making the Secretary of State a little more responsible to the country and the House of Commons and I recommend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand why the Opposition tabled the amendments but I advise the Committee that a two-stage process is involved. First, the clause merely empowers the Secretary of State to draw up regulations. Secondly, when he has done so, the regulations have to be approved by the House before they can be backed by statutory authority. The clause lays out the framework within which regulations must be drawn up and, necessarily, it has to be reasonably flexible. It merely directs the nature and type of regulations that the Secretary of State must draw up, but he does not have to make use of all the flexibility that it describes when doing so. However, if the wording were changed from "may" to "shall" he would be required to use all of the flexibility that is built into paragraphs (a) to (k). I do not believe that that is the purpose of the amendment, but as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0028">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
subsequent amendments would curtail some of that flexibility, I understand what the Opposition are getting at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations relate to matters of which we have not had detailed experience and the nature of the world is such that the more trivial a matter is, the more difficult it becomes to provide regulations that work properly, as we discovered with clause 8. The simple matter of giving relief to repair and recovery vehicles proves difficult and we keep on having to modify that clause. In empowering the Secretary of State to produce regulations, we should allow him to draw them up with an element of flexibility built into them while we are still exploring the necessary procedural arrangements. If we do not, we may find that the regulations are in some way unworkable because they have been too rigidly defined at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Committee not to accept the amendment, but to look assiduously at any regulations that we may, at a later stage, bring forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a disappointing answer from the Economic Secretary. The draftsmen of the Bill have gone to the trouble of including such provisions as clause 10(2)(d) to authorise
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State to refuse such an application on such grounds as he thinks fit".</p></blockquote>
The draftsmen must have had something in their minds when they included those words. Why was it thought that the Secretary of State would need powers, on such a trivial issue, to refuse someone the right to retain a personalised number plate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would have been helpful if, instead of saying that this gives some freedom for the second stage initiative of drawing up the regulations, the Economic Secretary had gone a little further in explaining why the subsection is included at all. He said that this is a minor matter, and that the Government have no experience of it. I question that. The business of personalised number plates has been going on for a number of years. It has probably been a pain in the neck to Swansea and a great deal of Government time must have been devoted to it. There must be some reason for the Government to retain powers to refuse someone permission to retain his or her number plates. What is that reason? It escapes me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall endeavour to respond to the hon. Gentleman's question. It is difficult, when empowering a Secretary of State to produce regulations, to think in detail what those regulations may contain. They will have to cope with people who try to abuse the system for fraudulent purposes, although we have not thought through the details of how they would do so. We will have to ensure that sufficient powers are built into the regulations to prevent any attempts to use the system to switch number plates for fraudulent purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be possible to specify clearly all conceivable ways in which the system could be abused, and it would not then be necessary to give discretion to the Secretary of State. But that might be unwise as fraudsters are always inventive, so we have to leave some residual discretion with the
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
Secretary of State to refuse an application on such grounds as he thinks fit. For that reason, the measure has been framed in a rather permissive way. It may be possible to tighten it up when the regulations are spelt out but it may be necessary to incorporate in them discretion for the Secretary of State to stop fraud and abuse and to make the system run smoothly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All that we are talking about is changing a registration mark from one vehicle to another. The Economic Secretary has said that he will try to tighten up the provision, and if he does so we will not take issue with him when the regulations are brought before the House. At present it appears that the regulations will be very wide. That is not desirable, and I should like the provision to be tightened up as much as possible. But in view of what the Economic Secretary said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 38, in page 6, line 48, leave out from "to" to end of line 49 and insert

This is a straightforward amendment. I believe that there will be interest in both Houses when such regulations are brought forward. The best way of dealing with the matter is under the affirmative rather than the negative resolution procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always a matter of judgment when deciding whether the affirmative or negative resolution procedure is appropriate.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This debate will be much the same as the previous one, but I shall try to be briefer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 39 would delete line 45 on page 7 of the Bill which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"for enabling the Secretary of State to determine as he thinks fit".</p></blockquote>
This provision is a little wider because it covers the sale by the Secretary of State of rights to specific registration marks. Fraud does not arise and the widening of the provision must be for a different reason. Subsection (3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Regulations under this section may, in particular, make provision".</p></blockquote>
That is similar to clause 10, but fraud will not arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 40 and 41 refer to subsection (3)(c)(i) and (ii) which cover the prices at which the rights may be sold and
	<br><blockquote><p>"the manner in which any such prices are to be determined."</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State will determine the prices as he thinks fit, but I hope that he will state in the regulations what he thinks fit so that that is clear. The public must know how the Secretary of State proposes to sell those rights and the manner in which he proposes to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 42 would require an extension of the specified period to be stated in regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 43 and 44 refer to "special reasons" and "other specified circumstances". If there are special reasons for the Secretary of State revoking a right, the circumstances should be reasonably closely prescribed. If there are "other specified circumstances", they should be specified. I do not understand why the word "other" is included as it is otiose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 45 seeks to replace the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"appear to the Secretary of State to"</p></blockquote>
with the word "made". There will be public interest about what rights the Secretary of State will sell. How will that be done? Will he sell to his friends, by ballot or only to the wealthy? Perhaps it would be good to tax the wealthy by making them pay through the nose. We should like an explanation about what is in the Government's mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the autumn, an experiment will take place on the sale of some 2,000 or so cherished numbers to see how it works, on the basis of which about 30,000 in a year may be sold. My right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary's eyes are lighting up at the prospect of financing the whole public expenditure programme in one fell swoop, without having to resort to unwholesome taxation. I am not sure that we can guarantee that. My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Transport—it may not be me—should be allowed flexibility and the clause will enable him to introduce regulations that must be approved by the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, there have been rumours about who the next Secretary of State for Transport will be. Is it intended that the maximum amount of revenue will be obtained by the sale of those numbers, or is another system being considered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is intended that the numbers should be sold for the best vaue for the taxpayer. There
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
would be an optimum amount as, clearly, we cannot ensure that every number will get the maximum amount. That could be done only through auctioning, which may not be appropriate for the less attractive numbers. That procedure would be too cumbersome, although it is intended that full value will be obtained, so that money can be ploughed back into financing the Government's public expenditure, which we should all welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fascinating picture. Will the auction be financed personally by the Secretary of State in, for example, Westminster hall or some other large public building, such as the Queen Elizabeth conference centre? Should I line up and look out for "AJB 1" or another cherished registration, or will there be a series of processes designed to restrict the number of registrations on the market at any one time? The extent to which high prices can be obtained will be influenced to some extent by the number on the market at a given time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I get the impression that the hon. Gentleman is entering the lists and envisages himself as Secretary of State for Transport—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am told that the whole Liberal party can get into one car.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Powell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Corby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not know whether or not the said Prime Minister was the proud possessor of such a number plate or whether it is still in circulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, in the interests of obtaining value for money, it is appropriate to limit the flow of numbers. It has been the practice to withhold from issue numbers one to 20 in any combination of letters, so that there is a stock of unissued marks available for sale. Apparently, they have some appeal and a regular supply will be available as the appropriate letters become available.
