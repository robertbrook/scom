CONSEQUENTIAL ADJUSTMENT OF RENT REBATE SUBSIDY</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment moved [this day]:</i> No. 455 in page 71, line 30, leave out subsection (1)—[<i>Mr. O'Brien.</i>]</p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Commitee that with this we are taking amendment No. 456, in page 71, leave out lines 36 to 39 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2) In subsection (5)(a) of that section, in sub-paragraph (i) leave out all words after 'by reference to Housing Revenue Account rebates.'.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Welcome to our Committee, Sir John. I am sure that you will enjoy our company.<br><br>
Before the break, I was giving way to my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) who wished to raise a matter. Perhaps he can do so now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the real issue is not whether a particular council gave £17,000 or £44 million out of the rate fund to the housing revenue account but whether some of the rent of a small and diminishing group of tenants on full rent would be used to pay for the housing benefit—the rebate—of those who could not afford increasing rents throughout the country?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is essentially what we are discussing. My hon. Friend strikes a sound note and expresses our fears about clause 70. It abolishes the rent rebate subsidy under which councils could reclaim from central government about 97 per cent. of their expenditure on rent rebates to council tenants. As my hon. Friend said, cutting off the contribution from the rate fund means that there will be enormous rent increases, and those who can afford to pay their rent will subsidise or contribute to the rent of the very poor.<br><br>
There is a long history of bipartisan support for the principle of rate fund contributions to the housing revenue account. In 1953, Harold Macmillan commended compulsory rate fund contributions to the HRA. In 1972, the right hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Walker), now the Secretary of State for Wales, reintroduced compulsory rate fund contributions after Duncan Sandys had made them optional in 1956. In 1980, the then Secretary of State
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 942</span>
for the Environment, the right hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine), made them optional once more. The record shows that Conservative Ministers and Secretaries of State have agreed that there is merit in having contributions from the rate fund to the housing revenue account.<br><br>
It is against that background that I and my hon. Friends tabled the amendments. As I said this morning, the clause is cruel, unfair and dishonest and should be amended as we propose.<br><br>
This morning, I drew attention to the comments made in letters and brief from the Housing Centre Trust and Age Concern. The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux has also sent us its observations on this important matter. NACAB is worried that the Bill's proposals will result in a steep rise in council rents which may lead to increased rent arrears and evictions. It substantiates that view by referring to a statement made by the Prime Minister on 20 December last year, which is recorded in <i>Hansard.</i><br><br>
In its briefing, the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux states that it:
<br><blockquote><p>"is concerned that a steep increase in council rents caused by this change could result in a dramatic worsening of the problems of rent arrears and evictions, already increased slarmingly … In the 6 months after the coutting of £650 million from the Housing Benefit scheme in April 1988, council rent arrears rose by nearly 40 per cent. according to the Prime Minister. The Department of Social Security has argued that council rent increases were to blame for this problem".</p></blockquote>
The problem is the change in social security benefits.<br><br>
We contend that, if the clause is allowed to go through unamended, there will be massive rent arrears and problems such as evictions and homelessness. It is a potential hazard for yet more people. Against that background, I ask the Minister and his colleagues to accept our amendments. To do so would be to act in the interests of people who will need assistance if the Bill's proposals are enacted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. John Gummer)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The most charitable word that can be used to describe the speech of the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) is "confused". The hon. Gentleman is confused, and some people have been confused by the sort of speech of which his was an example.<br><br>
The first fact is that the allegation that what we are proposing will eventually lead to steep rises in rents cannot be upheld. Subsidy in the first year will compensate local authorities for their recent input of rate fund support into the housing revenue account. Authorities will find that the subsidy in the first year will take that into account, even if they were unwise about the amounts that they moved from one account to the other. To say otherwise is not to face the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Battle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not for a moment, because it is important to give the facts as they have clearly not been understood. I hope that the Committee realises how serious and expensive a matter this is. Some authorities have behaved in a most peculiar way.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0940">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 943</span>
When we talk of the subsidy of council rents, we are not talking of subsidising people because they receive so low an income that they cannot pay council rents, but of the artificial holding down of council rents for those who are able to pay them. We are subsidising people whose incomes are above the level at which they would receive housing benefit.<br><br>
The <i>Liverpool Echo</i> of 23 February 1989 stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"Liverpool's Labour council could be forced to put up council house rents for the first time in six years."</p></blockquote>
In other words, people whose income is above the level at which they would receive housing subsidy have enjoyed a situation in which their rents have not risen for six years. The paper also stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"One of the biggest headaches for the Labour administration is new government legislation which will stop councillors using ratepayers' money to subsidise council house rents.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>This year, the council house rent account requires a £40 million subsidy from other council funds.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The account takes in income from all council house tenants—but it has to pay out large sums to pay for Liverpool's foreign loans, repairs, maintenance and management.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Two-thirds of the account is needed this year to pay for the foreign loans alone."</p></blockquote>
After reading that part of the explanation of Liverpool's housing fund, I looked to see where the money went. Liverpool increased its rates by 7.1 per cent. in 1983–84, by 17.9 per cent, in 1984–85 and by 7.8 per cent. in 1985–86. Altogether, there was an increase of 31.6 per cent. After rate capping rates increased by 14.1 per cent. in 1987–88, by 1.2 per cent. in 1988–89 and by 10.6 per cent. in 1989–90, making another 27.8 per cent. increase. There was an increase of more than 50 per cent. in the rates, but no increase in the rents of the very people who could pay them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify whether he is now giving a categoric assurance? Throughout our debates on these clauses, we have referred to an equation that includes rent rebates and housing benefit. Is the Minister saying that the Government will cover the money that local authorities pay out in housing benefit? Will housing benefit be met in full, irrespective of whether it goes to public or private sector tenants, and will there be no payment into that account from the rent collected from other tenants? Is that what the Minister is saying?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must listen to what I say. The explanation is quite simple. We have just heard a very confused speech. I am trying to take the points one by one and I will not allow the hon. Gentleman to make my speech confused. I shall deal with one item at a time.<br><br>
The first allegation was that rents are bound to rise because the previous subsidy from the general rate fund can no longer be made. The subsidy from the Government will take that factor into account in the first year, when it will be a matter of even-Stevens. The step will be expensive and will meet problems that many of us believe should not exist.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) was in danger of misleading the Committee by referring to Conservative and Labour councils. It is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 944</span>
one thing for a Conservative council to decide that it is more appropriate for an item in its housing account to be paid for by its general ratepayers, and for a relatively small amount to be transferred, but it is quite another when the figures involved are £8.5 million in Birmingham, £44 million in Camden, £30 million in Hackney, £51 million in Manchester, £35 million in Islington, £32 million in Liberal Tower Hamlets and nearly £29 million in Southwark. In those cases, general ratepayers are subsidising council house tenants irrespective of need. That is the issue.<br><br>
I am all for helping those who cannot pay, but to help people irrespective of need because they happen to live in a particular class of housing seems to me—I shall not use the word that I was about to employ; instead I shall use the description of the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien). It seems cruel. It is taking from people who may be less well off than those who are subsidised, irrespective of need. The word "cruel" is more properly used in that respect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to get the categories right first. The story should be told in full because there has obviously been a mistake.<br><br>
The second part of the argument was about the payment of housing benefit. Housing benefit will come from the taxpayer in the form of the new unified subsidy into the HRA and when the HRA gets into surplus. In the case of about 125 authorities, until now, that surplus has been used to subsidise the general ratepayer. That is what happens under present regulations in a large number of authorities—even Labour authorities. For example, last year the Labour authority in Sheffield paid money out of the housing tenants fund into the general rate fund. I wonder why that is considered more acceptable than paying money out of the tenants fund to provide help for the less well-off tenants. Why is it reasonable to subsidise the generality of ratepayers, irrespect of their needs, from the generality of tenants, but not reasonable to use a surplus from the tenants fund to subsidise those in need? I find it difficult to see a moral argument for that view. As for saying that it was cruel, disgraceful, outrageous, unacceptable—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Dishonest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is dishonest is the way in which the Labour party has tried to characterise this simple measure—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The only reason why the word "Rubbish" is shouted is that the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) failed to get it in while his party's spokesman was speaking: That was when it would have been appropriate and, if I may be allowed to say so, Sir John, when it would have been in order.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0941">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 945</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is right to keep the record straight. I have pointed out how, on numerous occasions, the Minister has sought to mislead the Committee. If he or his civil servants will check the record, they will find that Sheffield city council made a contribution from the rate fund into the HRA last year, and that in 1987–88 there was a contribution of £3.7 million. The reason for that was the cuts in subsidies paid by the Minister on behalf of the Government to local authorities. The right hon. Gentleman should stop trying to mislead the cohorts behind him on this important issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To make sure that we have it right, I must say that, in Sheffield, there was a payment of £709,000 from the tenants fund into the general rate fund. That is not as much as other authorities have paid the other way, but it is the actual figure and the parallel of others that I quoted. Sheffield should be a little careful before it makes such points as it is busily engaged in charging maintenance to capital. When we try to understand the accounts, it is a little more difficult than the hon. Member for Normanton suggests. That use of maintenance is an interesting method of running a system. The hon. Gentleman will admit that the way in which he presented the matter was perhaps less than fair, so I shall try to present it simply.<br><br>
When a housing fund reaches a level at which it is in surplus, that money is applied to a housing use. It goes towards the cost of helping those who cannot afford the rents. It might have been taken away to general taxation, which was a system that some people suggested, but our proposal avoids the ludicrous course of paying the surplus to the Government and the taxpayer, who is paying the housing benefit. That would be a silly argument, so we suggest that, where there is a surplus, it should be applied to alleviate the cost of housing benefit. Where there is no surplus, it will not be applied and the general taxpayer will pay the total amount. That seems perfectly reasonable. Furthermore, it is more likely to occur in well run, prudent Conservative authorities, and most of the authorities that are making a lot of the fuss will probably find that it does not affect them. I hope that the Committee will accept that it is more reasonable to vote against the amendments, if they are pressed, because it is more sensible to use the money in this way than to subsidise the general ratepayer, which is what happens now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: By using what the Minister described as "accountancy exercises" in capitalising long-term repair and maintenance, the city of Sheffield managed to avoid rate capping and ensured that it benefited from increased Government grants under the penalties. It therefore did a very good job on behalf of its community. Why is benefit rebate under the housing revenue account a housing cost for council tenants but not for private tenants and owner-occupiers? Why is a benefit paid by us as a society a personal housing income maintenance facility for owner-occupiers and private tenants and a housing cost for council tenants under the housing revenue account? Would the Minister agree that that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 946</span>
is at the heart of the amendment that we are discussing? The clause is discriminatory and that is why I described it last week as "despicable", to use one of the Minister's words.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may think that this is a most important issue, but it was not mentioned by the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien), although he went on about many other matters. I simply do not agree with his argument. If there is a surplus, this is a reasonable way to spend it and it is preferable to do so in the place that created the surplus than to give it back to the taxpayer, who immediately writes out a cheque for a larger amount to meet the requirements of the place that generated it.<br><br>
I do not think that it is a matter of vast principle. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) is making a lot of fuss about nothing. What is sad is that some people outside are being misled. I regret that.<br><br>
The position is simple, ordinary and reasonable. It is not in the least discriminatory, because it arises only if there is a surplus. There will not be one in a large number of areas, for reasons that we all understand. The hon. Gentleman must sometimes consider whether it would not be worth passing up temporary party political advantage in favour of ensuring that people are not frightened for reasons that are totally without foundation. I regret that the hon. Gentleman has chosen to treat the subject in this way; I think that he is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In his opening statement, the Minister accused my colleagues and me of misleading people outside the House. He said—it is on record—that the Government will fully fund the moneys that would be paid into the housing revenue account from rate fund contributions. He implied that, therefore, there will be no hardship. Will he now assure me that following the first year, no local authorities will suffer any hardship, that they will be compensated for subsequent years, and that local authorities will not need to increase rents because subsidies will be paid—as the Minister said they would be—in lieu of contributions from the rate fund? If the Minister is going to be honest, he should explain the situation exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not a question of going to be honest, the Minister has already been totally honest. The hon. Gentleman must be careful. Several statements have been unhelpful to those about whom we are talking. I repeat that, in the first year, the subsidy will compensate local authorities for their recent level of rate fund contributions. I clearly said that we shall do that even when that recent level has been of a most remarkable kind. We shall start generously. That base amount of subsidy will then roll forward year upon year. When the subsidy is decided and the targets on need are fixed, the subsidy will roll forward on the original basis.<br><br>
I have some misgivings. I worry about the council tenants in my constituency who have not had the benefit for many years of large subsidies from ratepayers. They will continue to be disadvantaged
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0942">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 947</span>
when compared with council tenants in Liverpool who have had that large subsidy. However, it is right to start in a way that no-one could misunderstand. I am sorry to hear that that has not been accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are sometimes in difficulty because our debates seem to depend on who is present in Committee. I am sad that the Minister was not present this morning during our debate with the Under-Secretary of State, who gave us an assurance that housing benefit would be counted within the ring-fence. He was not able to say that it would be paid in full, but he said that some contribution would be made from the rent of other tenants to the housing benefit payment. Now, the Minister is dismissing it as an irrelevance.<br><br>
I understand that the Minister may have been unable to attend this morning, but the one rogue factor in the equation is housing benefit payments, which depend on the uprating statement of the Department of Social Security in October. That statement is changed regularly during the year. If those payments are to be made by local authorities out of a ring-fenced revenue account, council tenants above the housing benefit level will have to make up the shortfall of council payments that are not repaid by the Government.<br><br>
In case anyone is under the illusion that the Government will repay all the money, I ask the Minister how he can square that idea with what has happened as a result of the Housing Act 1988. That and the more recent social security legislation state that, if a private landlord puts rent up sky high and the rent officer suggests that it is not in line with market rents, the Government may refuse to repay the council housing benefit payments it has made. The council would then have to make up the shortfall from the housing revenue account. The money in that account will come from rents paid by tenants who are above housing benefit level. That is why they will pay extra. The Minister is shaking his head. I shall let him reply in a few seconds. How will council tenants avoid paying the benefit of private sector tenants when the council will not be repaid by the Government?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The fact is that the Government will pay. There is no question of our not paying the actual sums paid out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So the Minister will not!</span></p>
<p>5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to argue with the hon. Gentleman when there is a difference between us, but there is none here. The sums paid to private tenants are outwith the housing revenue account; they are not paid by the housing revenue account and have nothing to do with it. We shall pay rent rebates in the subsidy on the actual sums paid out.<br><br>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that this has nothing to do with the money paid out to private tenants. If we are to argue, let it be about matters on which we differ and not those on which we agree.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Acton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 384, in page 72, line 2, at end add,
<br><blockquote><p>"provided always that no such credit shall be required in respect of the disregard of a war disablement pension or a war widow's pension payable under section 28(6)(a) above".</p></blockquote>
The amendment deals with the disregard of war disablement and war widows' benefit in assessing entitlement to housing benefit. At present, the first £5 of war disablement and war widows' pensions has to be disregarded in calculating housing benefit. The arrangement obviously increases the housing benefit entitlement of such pensioners and the cost is met by central government. In addition, local authorities currently have discretion to disregard more than £5—up to the full amount of the pension—and that cost is borne locally.<br><br>
The present position is unsatisfactory for two reasons. The Government will agree with the first: part of their housing policy is to promote mobility and to avoid decisions about where to live being distorted by local authority decisions. That is the level playing field argument to which my right hon. Friend referred. The present system for war widows inhibits mobility. A war widow may wish to move from a town such as Bournemouth, which disregards £60, to a town such as Bristol, which has a less generous policy. It is not right that, because of the grounds on which the Government have chosen to debate housing policy—the level playing field—war widows who may wish to move nearer to their relatives, or for other reasons, should be penalised due to the odd ways in which different local authorities interpret their discretion.<br><br>
The second reason is that war widows simply do not understand why those in one part of the country receive more benefit than others in another part, although their circumstances—their incomes and perhaps their rents—may be identical and their husbands died for the same cause. Their standards of living may be totally different because of the way in which local authorities interpret their discretion.<br><br>
At present, 282 of 483 local authorities operate a discretionary variation. War widows are calling for a national unified policy as set out in the amendment. I have seen the results of a survey carried out by the War Widows Association of Great Britain of the present arrangement. That survey reveals bewildering complexity and one sees exactly how various local authorities calculate the entitlement of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0943">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 949</span>
war widows. It varies from nil disregard over £5 in many of them to quite high figures—£53 is disregarded for one war widow in Bradford and £27 is disregarded for another in South Holland. War widows simply do not understand why, when the Government have made a decision on their pensions, the impact of that decision is blurred by the present anomaly.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend may ask why war widows should be singled out for special treatment in the amendment. The Government have already signalled that war widows are different. During the Standing Committee of the Social Security Bill, my hon. Friend the Minister for Social Security stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"To sum up, we are talking about a group of widows who deserve our sympathy and concern and who we all agree should be entitled to preferential treatment in benefits that puts them ahead of other widows."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 7 March 1989; c. 1036.]</p></blockquote>
The Government have already said that war widows are different from other widows. That preferential treatment is reflected in the Government's policy that makes war widows' pensions tax free when other widows' pensions are not. The impact of that decision is that the better-off war widow's income is tax free, so she benefits from the Government's decision that her circumstances are different, but the less well-off war widow has no such benefit because only the first £5 of her war widow's pension is disregarded when her housing benefit entitlement is calculated. No member of the Committee would defend a position in which a better-off war widow benefits and a less well-off war widow is penalised.<br><br>
Unless the whole of the war widow's pension is disregarded, as proposed in the amendment, there will be differential treatment of well-off and less well-off war widows.<br><br>
When drafting the amendment, we chose grounds that the Government had already chosen not so long ago and kept the concession very tightly drawn to minimise the cost to the Government. I do not know what the cost of the amendment would be, but I know that there are approximately 57,000 war widows and that the number is declining at the rate of 1,000 a year for widows from the first world war and 2,000 a year for widows from the second world war.<br><br>
The amendment would provide that there should be no transfer from another revenue account of the authority to its housing revenue account if it decided to exercise discretion and disregard the whole of the war widows' pension. That would increase the deficit on the housing revenue account, which would attract subsidy from the Treasury.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine Patnick <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hallam)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept my hon. Friend's statistics. Some 1,000 first world war widows and 2,000 second world war widows die every year. That is offset by the award of a new pre-1973 widows benefit involving 1,500 in the past full year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that a relatively small number of war widows will attract benefits in the future that they do not attract now. I hope that we shall not have too many more wars or war widows.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 950</span>
Members of the Committee may have received a letter from the War Widows Association of Great Britain. It was written by Mrs Kathleen Latham of 43 Ranmoor Close, Harrow, Middlesex which is no doubt why my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) added his name to amendment No. 384. Last time, he did not give me the benefit of the doubt, but he may do so this time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: To think that I voted for my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) in the last general election! The lady to whom he referred lives in the Harrow, East constituency, so it is no skin off my nose either way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I read the Committee proceedings of the Social Security Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Mr. Nicholson) took part in that debate. In column 1029 he said.
<br><blockquote><p>"War widows are pround people. They have not wanted to feel that they are begging individuals on society for help, and I hope that the Government will not respond in such a way that those people must crawl on their hands and knees to Richmond terrace for help.—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F;</i> 1 March 1989, c.1029.]</p></blockquote>
At present, they must beseech their local authority to give them the full disregard, but if the amendment were carried they would not need to do that. I am encouraged that my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I shall not be swayed from my decision by the press, which has already listed me as a rebel, along with one or two of my hon. Friends. Nor shall I be swayed by the Whips—not even by my hon. Friend the Member for Darlington, who I have known for a long time."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F;</i> 7 March 1989, c.1028.]</p></blockquote>
I look forward to that independence of spirit being exercised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Since my hon. Friend seeks to pray me in aid, may I refer him to my speech in which I cited various categories of people who had suffered from wars, especially the two world wars? We should not ignore disabled servicemen and concentrate only on war widows. I hope that my hon. Friend will apply that logic to the benefits that his amendment seeks to introduce.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I trust that members of the Committee will not stray too far into the affairs of another Committee. We should be referring to the Local Government and Housing Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are two aspects of that speech to which I want to draw attention. My hon. Friend expressed concern for war widows and an independence of mind.<br><br>
The amendment is supported by the Association of District Councils, which is Conservative controlled, the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, which is not, the Royal British Legion and the War Widows Association of Great Britain. I cannot believe that the pound would be destabilised or that confidence in the Government's Budget strategy would be undermined if the amendment were accepted. I think that the Government can afford to be magnanimous to a group of people who deserve magnanimity.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 951</span>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Truro)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support everything that the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) has said. War widows encounter confusion and muddle, which results in different circumstances in different parts of the country. They are reduced to begging local councillors to use their discretionary powers to help them. Many councillors hesitate to use those powers because of the expense involved and the difficulty caused by incurring that expense at local level. Consequently, different situations arise in different parts of the country.<br><br>
I am sure that all members of the Committee agree that war widows are a deserving group of people. I hope that, from the arguments that have already been presented, the Committee will recognise that this is an opportunity to help that deserving group, and that that would not open the floodgates of economic disaster. It is a reasoned and tight amendment which deals with the precise difficulty faced by a small and declining group.<br><br>
In the debate on the Social Security Bill, the Minister accepted that there was an argument for the preferential treatment of that group. Those who are better off as a result of the tax system are given preferential help. The amendment is aimed at those who are less well off and who hope to receive the support of housing benefit. I do not know the figures, but the cost will be relatively small. This is an opportunity to offer significant help to those people. I hope that the Committee will grasp it and that the Minister will respond favourably and not force the matter to a vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) mentioned local authorities' disregard. Some authorities disregard war widows' entire pension and others do not—it is discretionary. That anomaly should be cleared. I support the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton on this important amendment.<br><br>
I have received representations from the Royal British Legion on the matter. The ADC and the AMA support the amendment because it will relieve the hardship suffered by war widows. The Opposition support the amendment. I ask the Minister in all sincerity to accept the appeal by the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and others who consider the amendment worthy of support, and to demonstrate compassion towards people who are in need.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, we should examine the arguments that have been put forward, realising that all of us on both sides of the Committee are genuinely concerned about war widows. My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) quoted the Minister for Social Security, who clearly expressed the Government's recognition of the special case of war widows. I would not dream of arguing that one cannot treat war widows as a special case, but the amendment raises three problems. I am not talking about a technicality, because it would be possible for the Government to deal with that and reach an understanding. It always annoyed me when Ministers sought to dismiss an issue by saying, "This
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 952</span>
is technically incorrect, so you can't have it." That is not the reason.<br><br>
The best argument in favour of the amendment is that it will get rid of anomalies. I recognise the argument about anomalies, and my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton put it very clearly, but the difficulty is that the amendment does not get rid of the anomalies. First, it does not apply to war widows in private accommodation. That is because it applies only to housing benefit. In other words, it does not apply to a war widow in private accommodation, who receives housing help but does not have what is technically a housing benefit. Secondly, it does not apply unless the local authority allows it to apply, because the amendment merely proposes that the local authority can make payments out of the housing revenue fund—that is, out of the money paid in rent by tenants. It transfers the place where the money comes from—from the ratepayer, if that is what the council decides, to the tenant. It is the council that decides. It is not true that the amendment would stop the war widow having to persuade the local council to be generous, as my hon. Friend would say, because the council still has to use its discretion to pay the war widow a subsidy. The difference is, of course, that it would pay the subsidy from money paid by the tenants in rent. So the amendment would not get rid of the anomaly whereby some councils give the subsidy while others do not. Nor would it prevent the war widow from having to ask for the subsidy.<br><br>
Further, the amendment does not deal with other forms of benefit—income support, family credit, community charge rebates, and so on—which may apply to war widows. So the argument that the amendment gets rid of anomalies does not stand up.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton may argue that this is the beginning of a campaign to try to get a better deal for war widows. I see that argument, and I am sure that it will commend itself to all hon. Members, but the other aspect of that argument is finding the best way to wage the campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert B. Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hertfordshire, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure why my right hon. Friend should argue that this is the beginning of a campaign. Surely my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has already begun the campaign by recognising that there is a tax allowance for war widows. This is but one other step.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I gave that impression. I thought that I said at the start of my remarks that the Government rightly consider war widows as a special case, as is clear from the example that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, West (Mr. Jones) gave. It is possible to argue that the amendment is another step in the right direction, even though it does not get rid of all the anomalies. I find it difficult to understand, however, why we should be discussing it during our consideration of this Bill in Committee. The reason why it is difficult to table an amendment that meets the need that my hon. Friend perceives is one to which you, Sir John, almost alluded in an earlier intervention, when you
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0945">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 953</span>
warned the Committee that we should not go too far in discussing other benefits and other people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Other Committees.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: "Other Committees" were the words that you used, Sir John. A previous attempt was ruled out of order. We are on the boundary between what is proper for a local government Committee to discuss and what is proper for a social security Committee, including the budget of those Departments.<br><br>
When my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Action was a Minister within the Department of the Environment there must have been occasions when it might have delighted the heart of Ministers with responsibilities for social security to dictate his priorities. It might have been pleasant for them to say, "This is something that we want to do but we do not wish to pay for it ourselves as it is not one of our priorities. We would like some extra money from the local government budget." The difficulty is that even if I were enormously enthusiastic about the proposal, I should have to be careful about deciding in absentia how I would use the money and what was my immediate priority.<br><br>
I ask my hon. Friend to think again about the amendment. It would not remove the anomalies and it would not do what my hon. Friend wants it to do. The amendment would enable the local authority to ignore the war widow's pension and pay the difference out of money from the rentpayer in the housing revenue account. The Bill does not state that the taxpayer must meet that cost and the amendment does not propose that the Government must ante up the money or force the local authority to take that decision.<br><br>
If the amendment is accepted, it would make no difference to the present position of war widows, except that the local authorities could pay the subsidy from tenants' rents. It will not attract extra Government subsidy. War widows will be in the same anomalous position but the cost will be met, if the council so decide, from the money paid in rents by other tenants.<br><br>
I am not the Minister responsible, and it would be improper of me to say what I believe should be his priorities, as it would be improper of him to say what mine should be. However, if I believed that this was the right way to spend a sum which would be difficult to assess—it is not vast, but significant—I should not try to achieve my aim by this mechanism. In the course of pursuing a laudable aim, with great fervour, I do not believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton would wish to put war widows in a worse position, which the amendment might do. He would want the Government to consider the matter in a different light. I cannot promise that the Government will do that and shall not even suggest it by the use of weasel words.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
Whatever happens, I shall ensure that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security clearly understands my hon. Friend's considerable
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 954</span>
strength of argument and strength of mind about the issue. No doubt those who vote for the amendment will do so irrespective of the fact that, in many respects, it will have the opposite effect from the one intended. But those who do not vote for it and who feel strongly about war widows have the absolute assurance that I will not allow the fact that a vote is taken—taken because of the nature of the amendment—to make it appear that there is not strong pressure for a change in the rules for war widows. I shall make that clear to my right hon. Friend.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
The amendment would not achieve what my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton wishes. It would increase the anomalies, not remove them. If it made any material change, it would be to place the war widow in a worse position. Other than reasons of sentiment, perhaps, and the desire to give a clear signal to the Government, I cannot imagine how anyone on either side of the Committee could vote for the amendment, which does not achieve its aim. In a sense, I wish that it did so, because I would then not have to argue the case on technicalities, which I hate having to do. But the amendment does not achieve its objective and, if it were accepted, it would not result in one penny of taxpayers' money going in the direction that my hon. Friend would wish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a disgraceful attempt to blackmail the Committee. In effect, the Minister said that he is not prepared to put his hand in the taxpayers' pocket to pay for a benefit which has traditionally been paid by the taxpayer. The Minister is in a hole because the Government have decided that a national benefit will be partially paid for at local level. That is why he is in a trap. In fact, war widows would benefit from the proposal, although the Minister was right to say that they would not benefit sufficiently. But other tenants should not have to subsidise them. The trap is of the Minister's making. As a member of the Government, he has no right to tell the Committee or anyone else that he cannot do anything about the matter. He is better placed than anyone to ensure that the injustice does not continue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mistakes the facts. It is not something that the Government have decided. At present, war widows are subsidised by the ratepayer. It is not a question of the Government deciding that it shall be the system; that is the current system. If that system continues it must be possible for the ratepayer to continue to support it on a discretionary basis. We are merely maintaining the present system.<br><br>
It is reasonable to suggest that this is not the time to change the system, but my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton would like to do so. However, his amendment would not have that effect. If accepted, it would not have the result that he desires. If he wants his intended result, it would be necessary to amend social security legislation to cover those in local authority accommodation and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0946">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 955</span>
those in private accommodation. That would be in order in a social security Bill that sought to tackle the real issue. That, as the hon. Member for Hammersmith said, is the national taxpayer being involved in a new benefit to replace the present discretionary local government benefit.<br><br>
It is not my custom to argue on technicalities. I assure you of that, Sir John. You have not been with us for our earlier discussions but I am sure that you have read much of the background and will have noted that to be so. I had expected to have to argue the case for not doing so because it seemed to be the wrong Committee before which to present the amendment. I beg my hon. Friend not to press the amendment—it would not meet his aim—merely because he feels that it is the only way to demonstrate to me the seriousness of his case. His case has been strongly pressed home to me, but I do not think that his amendment would achieve his aim.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Squire <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hornchurch)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I waited until my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government had spoken because I looked to him to answer a number of the questions that the amendment seemed to raise. He did not do so. Perhaps in a while we may have a bit of a rerun.<br><br>
It is worth emphasising that the amendment is in order and that it relates to a discussion on a clause dealing with the consequential adjustments of rent rebate subsidy. It is important to underline, Sir John, that it is relevant to discuss it. From past membership of Committees, I have a feeling that it would not be the first time that we have approached problems in a Committee set up for other purposes that impinged upon other governmental and ministerial responsibilities. I am sure that my right hon. Friend feels the same. I do not think that that would rule out our present discussion.<br><br>
I was hoping that my right hon. Friend would produce figures, but he did not. Accordingly, I have made some calculations. If we average the 53,000 widows over 483 local authorities, the result is 110. I accept that war widows do not live throughout the country in arithmetic proportion: if they do, it is one of the more unknown scientific phenomena. If we take 110 at £25 per week, the result is approximately £100,000 per authority, accepting that the figure varies according to the number of war widows. I produce that figure in a vaccum because we need an idea of the sum. It is not a figure that shatters calculations in either the Department of the Environment or the Department of Social Security.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend, in urging us to reject the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young), said that it could lead to widows being in a worse position. Will he explain in more detail how he thinks that my hon. Friend's proposal, which I support, could make matters worse? If the discretion remains with local authorities, as he implied more than once, there is no change. If my right hon. Friend cannot explain, I shall be concerned, because I sense that we are considering some of the more trivial aspects of a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 956</span>
fairly important issue. I concede that the issue has been raised during the consideration of another Bill and that my right hon. Friend may not have expected it. However, it seems to me to be perfectly in order and to follow on reasonably from other discussions about the operation of housing benefits.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would not have been selected had it not been in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened most carefully to my right hon. Friend the Minister. He did not answer my point about the way in which decisions about mobility and where war widows live are distorted by the rather random way in which the present discretion is exercised, nor did he deal with my argument about the way in which, somewhat perversely, the Government have decided to help the better-off war widow by making the war widows' pension tax free but have not extended that help, as logic requires, to the less well-off war widow by increasing the disregards.<br><br>
The Government themselves are amending the Social Security Act 1986, as the first line of clause 70 shows. Therefore they are opening up a debate about social security. As you Sir John, have reminded the Committee, my amendment is in order. It has been called and, however inconvenient it is, the Committee must decide what to do with it.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Minister said that the amendment covered only local authority tenants. He is correct. To get the amendment in order, I had to confine it to local authority tenants. That does not mean that non-tenants are worse off. They can still be helped by exercise of the existing discretion. I suspect that, in practice, local authorities would, at their own cost, extend the disregard to non-local authority tenants to avoid the problems of which my right hon. Friend spoke. They would not be worse off than local authority tenants.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend said that the provision does not put money in pockets. He is right, but there would be no earthly reason for local authorities not to do so because they would get the money back from the Treasury. In effect, councils would have no reason for not extending the disregard right up the income scale if they were being fully compensated, and war widows would want to know why they did not.<br><br>
I was slightly worried by my right hon. Friend's final argument. Let us imagine that the Committee decided that local authorities could not top up the housing revenue account or reduce the loss on it by contributing the cost of the disregard from community charge payers. I think that my right hon. Friend then said that he would not give a subsidy. In other words, when my right hon. Friend considered the position of HRAs, most of which would be in deficit, he would not take account of the cost of the disregard even if local authorities had been told that they could not put money into the account. That seems a rather perverse line for the Government to take.<br><br>
Earlier when we discussed clause 69 several of us commented on the Minister's wide discretion to decide how much subsidy to give local
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0947">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 957</span>
authorities—how much money to put into their HRAs. If the Committee took the view that the charge should fall on the taxpayer, it would be perverse if the discretion was not so exercised.<br><br>
I am minded to press the amendment to a Division. My right hon. Friend has made it clear that he does not like the principle behind it. He said that he was not enthusiastic about the priorities. If the Committee feels that this is a priority, we can send a signal to wherever decisions are made by pressing the amendment to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to reinforce the remarks of the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young). I listened carefully to the Minister's arguments for rejecting the amendment. He began by saying that he was not one to oppose amendments for technical reasons, but he then proceeded to advance many highly technical arguments against the proposal. He did not make it clear that he opposed the amendment in principle. He would have been far more helpful if he had argued his case on that gound. Many members of the Committee wished to make a point of principle, and the technicalities that the Minister presented were unlikely to sway them.<br><br>
The Minister's overriding argument against the amendment was mentioned at the end of the comments of the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton, when he said that, as a matter of fact and intention, he would not put in the necessary money if the Committee accepted the amendment. I agree with the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton. The Minister's response is bizarre and goes against everything that the Committee is debating and intending to accept.<br><br>
The Minister seems to be trying to blackmail the Committee into rejecting the amendment by saying that if we accept it, he is not prepared to argue for the necessary money, which we would normally expect to be provided automatically. His argument will not sway those members of the Committee who want to help war widows. If the Minister chooses to ignore the policy that the Committee adopts, on his own head be it. He will not dissuade members of the Committee who planned to support the amendment. On the contrary, he will reinforce their determination to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I had said what the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) suggests, I would agree with him, but I did not, so I do not agree with him.<br><br>
I said that the amendment would not achieve its objective. I did not tell my Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) that this would not be my priority. I said that I am the Minister responsible for local government, so I do not determine priorities in this issue. I then said that if I were Secretary of State for Social Security and this was my priority, I would not achieve it through the amendment, nor would I urge my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment to use this method. The subsidy will be calculated on the whole of mandatory rebates. Some expenditure will not count towards the subsidy and the use of discretionary arrangements would not do so. My
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 958</span>
hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton might say that he wants to convince me that taxpayers' money should be spent, but if he succeeds and I explain the proposition to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Services, it will not be implemented in the way that my hon. Friend has in mind. Instead, there will be a general benefit. We shall not accept the amendment.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton rightly said that the position might be worse, but I can conceive that a local authority might see an opportunity to place a weight on the backs of tenants. That would not be fair. We are not prepared to proceed in that way because some local authorities might use that as an excuse not to allow the discretionary rights that the amendment would make available. In those circumstances, war widows would be worse off.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton said that I had not dealt with the problem of mobility but I thought that I had in the sense that it would remain a discretionary arrangement under his amendment. I told him that the system works in such a way that there would be no extra subsidy, and my hon. Friend the Minister for Social Security said during the proceedings of the Committee that considered the Social Security Bill that he had undertaken to assess the problems of hardship among war widows and would consider that evidence before Report and Third Reading. If I were advising my hon. Friend the Minister for Social Security on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton, I would be saying, "Make the change there, not here, because the amendment would have a perverse effect."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend clarify what he said a few moments ago? Is he saying that the effect of the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) would be that the burden of extra benefit would fall on other tenants and not on national taxpayers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. If it had any effect it would enable a local authority to place on tenants the burden of paying for war widows' pensions. My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton is really asking the Government to produce a scheme whereby local authorities cease to have discretion in something which would happen automatically. That is a perfectly proper and reasonable request, but he knows that I cannot provide for it in the Bill, otherwise he would have tabled an amendment that covered the matter in its totality. That would have been out of order as it would have referred to private tenants, for example, as my hon. Friend said. But there will be no extension to private tenants as he suggests because no extra money will go into the HRA as a result of the amendment.<br><br>
My hon. Friend was right to claim that the Government could say that to help some war widows living in particular circumstances in the areas of local authorities that decided to use the HRA in a certain way, they would put extra money into the fund. However, I could not recommend the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0948">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 959</span>
Government to follow that course as it would not deal with the real problem that my hon. Friend has described. That is not because I regard the matter as unimportant but because it would not be what he wants us to do. My hon. Friend has reasonably used this opportunity to get as near as possible to what he wants included in the Bill, but we all know that it is not the place for it.<br><br>
What would be better? If the amendment were agreed to—I exclude the point that I made to my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire), which he may not think is important—the position would not change for war widows. That is a fact, so I suggest that it would be wrong to accept the amendment as it is. I do not think it better to lay the cost of the discretion on the backs of the tenants, nor do I think that that is what my hon. Friend wishes. I believe that he wants the cost to feed through to the taxpayer, but under the amendment it would not do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. The Minister is saying that he does not want to lay the cost on the backs of tenants, yet that is what the Government have consistently done with housing benefit and that is what they are doing in the Bill.<br><br>
The Minister claims that he cannot change the provision because it is a matter that comes within the Social Security Bill. But that is wrong. The kindest thing that I can say is that the Minister has fallen down the black hole between two Departments, and there are those who would say that the Minister is a mobile black hole personified. In fact, the clause amends the Social Security Act 1986, which contains a definition of the housing revenue account.<br><br>
The housing revenue account is essentially a matter for the Minister for Local Government, but is his definition of it so inadequate that he cannot influence what takes place? The definition is found in the Social Security Act because of the interrelationship between the two Departments, yet the Minister is asking us to believe that he has no influence on it whatsoever. That would be a dreadful confession of inadequacy on the Minister's behalf. I suspect that the real answer is that he hoped to shuffle this off so that blame is not pinned on him. But it will be, because the Minister could change the Bill and he is refusing to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The speech of the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) was uncharacteristically unhelpful. We all seek a solution to the problem.<br><br>
I listened carefully to my right hon. Friend the Minister. Opposition Members would not be so cynical in their sedentary remarks if they studied the way in which I have spoken and voted on amendments in Committee. I have voted in favour of amendments that the Government have not accepted.<br><br>
The burden of my right hon. Friend's case is that war widows might be in a worse position if we accepted the amendment. I have listened carefully to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 960</span>
the three reasons that he advanced, and I cannot see that war widows would be worse off. I accept that the amendment is not all that it might be, and that we are probably attempting to amend the wrong Bill. However, when the Bill goes to another place we might offer their Lordships a pick-a-Bill scheme: we could say to them, "Either you do something to the Social Security Bill, or you do something to the Local Government and Housing Bill. We do not mind which; it is clear what we want."<br><br>
I take it that my right hon. Friend shares the objectives of my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young). We must make it clear that we do not think that the position of war widows is satisfactory, and that we want something better for them. Their Lordships will, I am sure, read carefully the words of my right hon. Friend about war widows in private accommodation. He also said that there is nothing in the Bill to say that the taxpayer will pay for the concession. I am sure that will be considered in another place.<br><br>
It is with some regret that I shall have to support the amendment, because it is important to advance the case of war widows. Whether the amendment is defective or perfectly formed, there is more mileage to be got out of this Bill and the Social Security Bill. In the end of the day, I hope that we shall get something better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Howarth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Knowsley, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I misjudged from his opening sentences what the hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) was about to say, and for that I apologise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to put right two comments of the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley). The difference between the amendment and the policy that we discussed earlier is that housing revenue account will be used for housing benefit only when there is a surplus. The amendment would enable tenants to be charged the cost of implementing widows' disregards irrespective of whether there is a surplus. Rents would rise to cover that cost whatever the level of those rents and their reasonableness.<br><br>
I discount the various ways in which the hon. Gentleman tried to use invective, but his second comment was not true. If we wished to do what my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) wishes to do, this is not the way in which to proceed because it cannot be done in this way. The provision cannot be extended to the people whom my hon. Friend wishes to benefit because of the restrictions of the Bill. It would have to be done through the Social Security Bill.<br><br>
That brings me to the pick-a-Bill proposal of my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes). He must vote as he wishes, but I hope that he accepts that the proposal would not affect war widows, except in marginal cases when it might be used as an excuse for not doing what might otherwise have been done—[<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) has not been present during the debate and his sotto voce contributions are not helpful.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 961</span>
There will be no pick-a-Bill in another place because their Lordships cannot do to the Bill what we cannot do to it. They would have to amend the Social Security Bill if they wanted to achieve what my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton seeks. If their Lordships decided to change the Social Security Bill, the provision would probably fall into desuetude.</span></p>

<p>No. 464, in Clause 72, page 72, line 32, leave out subsection (2)</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are now considering the residual debt subsidy. The Government are keen to consider the block transfer of council estates from local authorities to other landlords. That is covered by the Housing Act 1985, which refers to voluntary transfers, or the Housing Act 1988, which refers to housing trusts and change of landlord. Such links should be discussed.<br><br>
Residual debt subsidy aims to encourage transfers by subsiding residual debt remaining when transfers have taken place. Different rates will apply to different categories of transfer and we must ask ourselves why that should be so. The Bill seeks to encourage tenants to transfer by forcing up their rents.<br><br>
I refer, too, to the repayment of debt by the use of capital receipts to achieve transfer by providing for local authorities to disengage entirely from their housing responsibilities. The Bill will reduce the share of receipt that can be reinvested and the incentive to sell council houses.<br><br>
The consequence of such transfers for other housing matters develops. Because of the shortage of houses there will be an increase in homelessness. Amendment No. 458 refers to a local authority selling at a negative value and having to make a payment to the new landlord. It is like a dowry payment to the new landlord by the local authority.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0950">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 963</span>
The amendment calls for subsidy to be made available on those dowry payments. It also proposes that where a dowry is payable, it should be met by credit approval under part IV, buy that no payment or credit approval should be available on a voluntary transfer where fewer than 50 per cent. of the tenants eligible to vote have agreed to the transfer.<br><br>
The consultation paper published earlier this year was silent on whether dowry payments would be eligible for residual debt subsidy. Will the Minister tell us whether residual debt subsidy will apply in cases in which the property was sold at a loss?<br><br>
Amendment No. 459 proposes that residual debt subsidy should be payable on a voluntary transfer only if the local authority obtained the best price possible or the market value. In such cases, the value should be fixed by the district valuer.<br><br>
As the law on voluntarty transfers currently stands, the council needs the consent of the Secretary of State if it proposes to sell the properties.
<br><blockquote><p>"for a consideration less than the best that can reasonably be obtained."</p></blockquote>
I quote from section 123 of the Local Government Act 1972. As the consent of the Secretary of State is required before a sale can be made, the Department of the Environment has effective control over the financial terms of voluntary transfers and can approve low valuations, if that will encourage a transfer.<br><br>
The lower the valuation, the greater the level of residual debt subsidy. Clearly, it would be unreasonable for low transfer prices to be subsdised by all other recipients of subsidy. The amendment, therefore, proposes that it should not be paid, except where the best value has been obtained. That would be fixed by the district valuer, who already has that responsbility under the pick-a-landlord and the right-to-buy schemes. The borough of Redbridge proposes to sell its stock for £9,000 per property, yet the average price in that area is £100,000. How can that be reconciled? Perhaps the Minister can explain.<br><br>
Is it the policy of the Secretary of State that disposals should be at market value or for the best consideration possible? Was that the case with Sevenoaks and Chilterns—the two that have gone through, with the Secretary of State's approval? Does it not demonstrate that the Government are simply asset stripping, and that it is their policy to strip local government of its assets? Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.<br><br>
Clause 71 introduces the residual debt subsidy, which will be paid in respect of the outstanding loan debt on property that is transferred from council ownership. The rate at which subsidy is paid depends on the type of transfer. Amendment No. 460 seeks to ensure that any sums paid by the Government as residual debt subsidy will not reduce the amounts of main housing subsidy that are available to support investment and control rents.<br><br>
It is vital that transfers of stock and subsequent payment of subsidy do not restrict the level of investment in housing. Investment in housing is paramount, and subsidy payments should not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 964</span>
restrict that investment. If it did, tenants who remained with the councils would suffer as a result of the reduced resources. In addition, such action would do nothing to offer people on housing waiting lists and people who are homeless any hope of increased housing opportunities. It would be deeply disturbing if simple shifts in tenure had the effect of sucking money away from where it was most needed.<br><br>
That is particularly worrying, because there are disturbing precedents to suggest that residual debt subsidy will be diverted from the national housing accounts. For example, the cost of housing action trusts is subtracted from the housing investment programme allocation, as is the estate action programme and other housing investment programmes. Such top slicing is most worrying for people who are responsible for finding accommodation for the homeless and others.<br><br>
Can the Minister confirm that the housing revenue account subsidy and the residul debt subsidy will not come from the same national pot? In other words, we trust that the Government will not take money from one source to pay another, or penalise people who rely on housing revenue subsidy. The Minister for Local Government assured us that that will roll on—I think that that was the term that he used. I want assurance that the Government will not divide the national pool.<br><br>
As residual debt subsidy is open-ended and its payment is not within the Minister's control, how will it be budgeted? What estimate has the Minister made for residual debt subsidy for the financial year 1990–91, and how much has been set aside for the current year, 1989–90? I hope that the Minister will give the Committee some idea when she replies. Some consideration must be given to how the budget is calculated.<br><br>
The Bill is silent on the method of calculating entitlement to residual debt subsidy. The consultation paper published by the Department of the Environment in January stated that residual debt subsidy would be calculated on the average long debt outstanding at the time of the transfer.<br><br>
6.15 pm<br><br>
Under amendment No. 461 debt subsidy entitlement would be calculated on the outstanding debt on the properties transferred, which would be fairer and more in keeping with good practice. The Minister should comment on that matter.<br><br>
If residual debt subsidy is calculated using average figures, some authorities will lose financially when the loan debt on the properties transferred is higher than the average used for the calculation. When that occurs, the authority and, eventually, the residents, will have to pay the cost of debt on properties that the authority no longer owns and from which it receives no income. In practice, there is no difficulty in estimating the debt associated with, for example, a block of flats that has to be sold.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I speak to the amendment drafted by the Institute of Housing for which, as I said, I am consultant. It is a probing amendment,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0951">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 965</span>
because I do not wish to push my luck. Its objective is different from that of the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien). It seeks to provide an incentive for the disposal of local authority stock, while ensuring that the cost of Government policy is not borne by remaining tenants, ratepayers or future payers of the community charge.<br><br>
The disposal price will often be insufficient to redeem the whole of the debt apportioned to the transferred dwellings. In the consultation paper on housing subsidy following the disposal of stock, the Government proposed a new residual debt subsidy to be paid in respect of loan charges on any notional residual debt relating to the dwellings sold. The residual debt subsidy would be paid at the rate of 75 per cent. of the loan charges for sale under the tenants' choice provisions and 90 per cent. of the loan charges for all voluntary sales of stock to other landlords. The remaining percentage in all cases is to be met from the rates and in future from the community charge. In the case of housing action trusts, the Government propose a 100 per cent. subsidy on the loan charges on any residual debt, plus a safety net payment to ensure that none of the authorities' remaining tenants or ratepayers suffer financially as a result of the transfer of stock to a housing action trust.<br><br>
The arrangements for housing action trusts are desirable, but the same arguments can be advanced for other forms of disposal. The mix is not set in stone, however. In Wales, it is proposed that the rate of residual debt subsidy should be 90 per cent. in all cases. Why is less incentive needed in Wales than in England? Perhaps it is because of the presence of my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) whom, as all good readers of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> know, the alliance party believes will be the next Secretary of State for Wales. Perhaps it is his influence on this Committee that has enabled him to get such a good deal for Wales and why alliance Members have absented themselves from this important debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is rather wide of the subject and highly speculative.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Government's proposed mixed percentage arrangements have the disadvantage of providing authorities with an increased incentive to campaign against a tenant's choice transfer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mrs. Virginia Bottomley)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose behind the introduction of a residual debt subsidy is to find a way to tackle the difficulty that increasingly arises when local authorities dispose of stock. There is an almost arbitary effect with some having to continue to pay loan charges towards properties that they no longer own and others having a windfall again. Following the Housing Act 1988, the Government reviewed the matter and in January this year issued a consulstation paper, "Housing Subsidy Following Disposals of Stock". Many of the matters raised in this brief debate are dealt with in that consultation paper. Several aspects have not yet
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 966</span>
been finalised and are still being discussed with local authorities.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) seems to be a little confused about some of the proposals and their likely effects. I hope to clarify several of those matters. Before doing do, I should say that I seriously resent his cynicism and negative attitude about the purpose of our proposals. The Government feel strongly that tenants will benefit from a multiplicity of landlords. Anyone who has worked, as I have, for 13 years in the municipal deserts of Lambeth and South wark find it difficult to feel especially attached and emotional about the effectiveness and the value of the local authority as the only provider of housing for those in need.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that many of us are equally worried about those "municipal deserts", as she calls them, and are astonished that by the Housing Act 1988 the Government succeeded in making many of them more popular than they were previously? The kind of predatory takeovers that are possible under the legislation are feared.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is hardly worth responding to that. I was referring to a time when the Labour party was in Government. If local authorities are now trying to use scare tactics on tenants who have been offered an opportunity such as many would have given a great deal for in years gone by, that is to their discredit. They should recognise the sincerity and seriousness with which the Government are trying to tackle those problems and should behave more constructively and positively in the interests of those people of whom they are currently the landlords.<br><br>
As for the first part of amendment No. 458, I am pleased to have the opportunity to tackle the question of disposals under the HATs and tenants' choice provisions introduced in the Housing Act 1988. They open up new prospects and opportunities for many council tenants. Although clause 71 does not specifically refer to the transfers, it is not our intention that costs other than loan charges associated with residual debts—such as legal fees, surveys or administrative costs—should be met by residual debt subsidy. Those revenue costs are supported by housing subsidy generally. However, we intend that one specific cost—that of a dowry associated with a disposal, whether a HAT, tenants' choice or voluntary disposal—is included in the calculation of the residual debt, thereby is covered by any payments of residual debt subsidy.<br><br>
The second part of amendment No. 458 proposes that supplementary credit approvals under the new capital finance system be issued to cover the whole of other payments made in transfers of local authority stock to a HAT, under the tenants' choice procedures or in respect of voluntary disposal of stock. The only other payments of a capital nature would seem to be dowries.<br><br>
Where an authority is required to pay a dowry in respect of a HAT, we have already undertaken clearly that no additional costs will fall on remaining tenants or ratepayers. That is a firm commitment.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0952">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 967</span>
Any other suggestion is mere mischief making and a refusal to hear what the Government have said clearly many times. We shall issue supplementary credit approvals if they are needed to meet that objective.<br><br>
Turning to tenants' choice transfers, I cannot give a guarantee that an individual authority's HIP allocation will automatically be increased on account of any dowry payment that it may make. We are considering how best to deal with any problems in funding dowries that might arise, but we have not yet come to a final decision.<br><br>
The third part of amendment No. 458 and the second half of amendment No. 462 are again attempts, to which we are accustomed, to resurrect old debates on tenant consultation. Once again, hon. Members harp on the worst scare stories and inflame tenants' anxieties. The Opposition are returning to a topic which was much debated previously, and was so admirably put to rest by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State in the House last evening.<br><br>
We believe that a democratically-elected local authority should be free to decide whether it would be in the best interests of its residents to opt out of providing housing directly, but within certain constraints. We set out those constraints in our guidelines on large-scale voluntary transfers last June. Once again, it is not our view that a responsible and effective local authority has to provide services. What matters is that services are properly and effectively provided. We do not have to provide a form of municipal aggrandisement.<br><br>
It is right that there be safeguards for tenants, and we have provided them. Schedule 3A to the Housing Act 1985 provides for tenants to be properly consulted; it also states that the Secretary of State cannot agree to a transfer if there is overwhelming opposition to it. But the Secretary of State is acting as a long-stop here. It is the responsibility of the local authority to consult its tenants and to consider their views before deciding whether to proceed. It is clear that local authorities will wish to consult their tenants properly and responsibly on cases that go ahead.<br><br>
I sympathise with the proposition behind amendment No. 459. I am pleased that hon. Members are anxious that proper value and a proper price are obtained for properties, and that housing is not sold too cheaply by a local authority. That is the line that the Government are taking. Perhaps a brief explanation will reassure the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
The guidelines on large-scale voluntary transfers which we issued last June state that sales should, in all normal cases, be at market value, subject to tenancy with an allowance for any backlog of repairs which will need to be tackled. That remains the position and we have no plans to change it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about Redbridge?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Normanton mentions Redbridge. That is different. He is referring to the average price that is being paid for

right-to-buy houses. This discussion relates to the widespread sale of stock.<br><br>
The important factor about Redbridge was that the discount applied. One of the Government's great triumphs has been their enabling people to buy their home. Redbridge is a case in point. I am talking of the more widespread sale of properties and transfers.<br><br>
6.30 pm<br><br>
We are not discussing the price that might be obtained with vacant possession. I hope that the hon. Member for Normanton will agree with our reason for expecting tenanted market value. We intend the housing to remain available for letting in the long term to those who need it. We have taken powers to control disposals by new landlords precisely to ensure that housing is not sold for a quick profit.<br><br>
The price should reflect the fact that property is tenanted and will be continued to be tenanted by people in need. Subject to that constraint, we agree that a local authority selling a large part or all of its housing should do so at market value. I welcome the commitment of the hon. Member for Normanton that market value rather than outstanding loan debt should be the crucial factor.<br><br>
The second part of the amendment calls for the district valuer to determine the market value of the stock to be disposed of. We recognise that with voluntary transfers a local authority might be willing or even eager to sell at less than market value, so there must be an external check. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be reassured that that check exists in the Secretary of State. He will ask the council for information on which the valuation is based and take professional advice from valuers to satisfy himself that the value is the tenanted market value. If he is not satisfied, he can refer the matter to the district valuer. The residual debt subsidy would be paid on the basis of tenanted market value, properly checked, and achieving the aim of the amendment.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 460, 461 and 463 deal with the method of calculation of residual debt subsidy. The consultation papers issued by the Department to local authority associations show that entitlement to residual debt subsidy would be calculated separately from that for main housing subsidy after 1 April 1990. An authority can therefore receive residual debt subsidy even if it has no main housing subsidy. I hope that the hon. Member for Normanton will also be assured that residual debt subsidy is not cash limited. It is provided separately from the main housing revenue account subsidy, so his fears on that front are groundless.<br><br>
In the consultation paper we made it clear that we would welcome views on how best to calculate the residual debt subsidy. Responses from local authorities were fairly evenly divided on whether we should use actual or average loan debt for the calculation. We have not yet reached a firm conclusion. I hope that the hon. Member for Normanton will appreciate that the matters involved in amendment No. 461 are still to be decided on the basis of our discussions.<br><br>
We have undertaken that no extra costs arising out of transfer to a HAT shall fall on the remaining
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0953">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 969</span>
tenants or charge payers of a local authority. We recognise that the Secretary of State takes the initiative for a HAT and has a much greater involvement in it than in any other type of disposal. The hon. Member for Normanton and my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) questioned why provision for a HAT was different from that for other types of disposal. The initative for a HAT transfer lies with the Secretary of State, whereas with voluntary disposals tenants' choice or the right to buy there is a different arrangement.<br><br>
We cannot allow double subsidy. The proposal that we should not adjust the housing revenue account subsidy in the light of payment of a residual debt subsidy would undermine the proposals in our consultation paper and the direction in which we are trying to move. I believe that I have answered amendment No. 460.<br><br>
I accept that the matter is complex. The first part of amendment No. 462 involves the rate at which residual debt subsidy is to be paid. We are considering all the responses to the consultation paper which have been received and we shall take the various representations into account. Our view is that the residual debt subsidy should be set at a rate below 100 per cent. of the loan charges on any residual debt to provide authorities with an incentive to take sensible decisions to maintain the value of their stock in advance of disposal and to obtain the best sale price.<br><br>
There has been some discussion about what would be appropriate figures and my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton asked why special arrangements were made for Wales. I should like to say, Sir John, that it was because you were presiding over our proceedings today, or give a number of the other reasons that were advanced, but the fact is that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales considered that the problems and uncertainties in Wales would be different. The rates of subsidy in each country is a question that remains to be settled firmly and finally. Similarly, the distinction between the 75 per cent. rate and the 90 per cent. rate is a matter for discussion. We want to encourage voluntary disposals of stock and believe in a multiplicity of providers of housing. It is right for the higher figure of 90 per cent. to apply for voluntary disposals, with the 75 per cent. applying to tenants' choice of HATs but, of course, we shall give further consideration to all those points.<br><br>
I hope that I have dealt with the issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and the Institute of Housing, which had a proper grasp of the proposals that we seek to advance.<br><br>
Amendment No. 463 is also unacceptable, especially in providing that authorities are fully compensated for lost rent income following disposals. We announced at the end of last month that no change to the present rule regarding compensation for lost rent income would be made in 1989–1990, but we remain to be convinced that we should drop this proposed change for subsequent financial years. Therefore, we are still considering making such a change in the future, although we have not come to a final decision. Our proposals deal
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 970</span>
with the problem of loan charges when property is disposed of and it seems rather ridiculous to continue to make an allowance for lost rent.<br><br>
We cannot agree to amendment No. 464. Clause 72(2) allows my right hon. Friend to make a determination during the course of a financial year having retrospective effect in relation to sales which take place at any time in that year. This is in line with established practice on the making of determinations for main housing subsidy. I assure the Committee that we shall consult the local authority associations in the usual way before any determinations are made. For 1989–90, we need to take powers which will enable my right hon. Friend to apply the new rules to disposals which may take place this financial year before this Bill has received Royal Assent. This will clearly be to the advantage of those authorities eligible to receive residual debt subsidy.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Member for Normanton is satisfied with my answers to his questions. A number of these matters are still subject to consultation and we shall bear his points in mind. I hope that he will not press his amendment to a Division.</span></p>

<p>Government amendment No. 522.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are particularly interested in amendments Nos. 480 and 482, and I shall concentrate on those. The first places a duty on the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 972</span>
Secretary of State to consult representatives of local Government as he thinks appropriate before making a determination or giving a direction. The amendment would make that duty firmer and ensure that representative bodies are consulted.<br><br>
It is important that consultations take place with bodies that represent elected members of councils and are thus accountable to tenants throughout the country. I naturally want to see a lot of consultation between thet Government and the Conservative-controlled Association of District Councils and London Boroughs Association because on these matters they are usually more on my side than on the Government's. The least that the Government can do is to consult some of their own members, as well as those representing the Labour party.<br><br>
The worry is that the Secretary of State may only consult professional bodies, which may make a valuable contribution but are not representative of the democratic process. We believe that much as we want to listen to the professionals, it is vital that if people are to be encouraged to take part in local government elections—which they should be—they know that their local representatives, and not just the professionals, are consulted by the Secretary of State.<br><br>
The amendment restores the position as set out in the Housing Act 1985. Will the Minister say why he has moved away from the position in that Act? We do not want any reduction in the level of consultation, which we consider important.<br><br>
Amendment No. 481 allows the Secretary of State to make determination or give directions with respect to local authorities. However, it provides no right for a council to challenge a decision. This amendment seeks to provide a right of appeal to an independent arbiter, so that a decision can be reconsidered.<br><br>
Amendment No. 482 is important and I shall want to hear the Minister's comments on it. He will see that it involves a long set of suggestions—indeed, it is one of the longest amendments in the amendment paper. We are seeking to add to the list of bodies that the Secretary of State has a duty to consult and to impose on him a duty to consider the representations that he receives.<br><br>
The list shows the extent and impact of the Bill. It shows how the Secretary of State is taking increasing powers and undermining and devaluing local authorites. We argue in the amendments that the issues listed here are far too important to allow the Secretary of State simply to bulldoze the Bill through Parliament without considering representations.<br><br>
6.45 pm<br><br>
The Secretary of State's powers should not be unlimited. Currently, he has the power to issue orders and directions on such things as housing revenue accounts and housing repair accounts, the payment of subsidy under the new regime—the housing revenue account subsidy and residual debt subsidy—the adjustment of subsidies for the year 1989–90, the information and certificates needed by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0955">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 973</span>
the Secretary of State, the repayment of subsidy by local authorities and details of the housing revenue accounts. It is amazing that the Government can at one time say that they are in favour of local government and at another take power to prevent effective consultation or consideration of a local authority's views.<br><br>
It would be better for the Government to come clean and say that they do not really believe in local government but in central direction and telling local authorites how to behave, attempts at consultation and discussion not being worthwhile. The Government want to do it all, and expect local authorities to rubber stamp their decisions. That is the Bill's effect. We seek to reverse it with the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Ian Grist)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How nice it is to speak in front of you, Sir John. I learnt only recently that you were on the Chairman's Panel; I apologise for my ignorance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is wholly irrelevant to the matter under discussion, but I thank the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grist</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) showed his suspicion of the Government, but not unreasonably for the Opposition. Nevertheless, in amendment No. 482 he pushes us to say that we have carried out realistic consultation. It is obvious that authorities will sometimes be disappointed with how things work out. Everyone who has served on a local authority will know that.<br><br>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that the consultation process is for real. We have not gone to the trouble of setting up an elaborate definition for the housing revenue account and a new subsidy system dependent upon it, only to throw it all away by failing to take account of those who work in the area, especially when we ask for their advice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is far too important.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grist</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that it is far too important. We entirely agree with him, that is why amendment No. 482 is unnecessary.<br><br>
On amendment No. 480, I agree that there has been a change of wording since the Housing Act 1985, but that is a traditional formula which requires consultation with such local authority associations and local authorities as appear to be concerned and with any individual local authority with whom consultation appears to be desirable. We have moved away from that wording because there have been substantial changes in the structure of local authority associations and there may well be further changes in the future.<br><br>
The wording leaves it open to the Secretary of State to exercise his discretion to consult with whoever in his view are appropriate representatives of local government for the purpose of the consultation process in question. The new words are consistent with the words that now appear, for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 974</span>
instance, in the Local Government Finance Act 1989 and the Local Government Act 1988. Several of us here served on the Committees on both of those Bills.<br><br>
By contrast, amendment No. 481 is phrased as though directions and determinations are applied individually to individual authorities and can therefore properly be made the subject of an appeals procedure. In fact, it has been comparatively rare for special determinations to be made affecting individual authorities under the existing subsidy system, and I believe that that will continue to be the case. The system simply allows the Secretary of State to disapply the general rules where their full rigour would get in the way of achieving general subsidy policy. Special—individual—determinations have almost invariably been used at the behest of the authorities themselves, for instance to preserve subsidy on demolished dwellings.<br><br>
Government amendment No. 522 seeks to ensure that the consultations now in progress with the local authority associations and others will continue up until Royal Assent to satisfy the requirement to consult in the Bill. Otherwise, we would have to go through the whole process again and time would unnecessarily be lost.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having heard that response, I can understand why the Government sent the hon. Gentleman out of Wales before a vital by-election. If he is so convinced that consultation will take place, why does he not accept the amendment? He virtually said that consultation will take place, and the amendment would make it statutory. What he is really saying is that consultation will not take place unless the Government want it to. If the Minister came out and said that, I would understand it, but he is trying to dress up his reply with a simplistic explanation.<br><br>
The Government are taking to themselves the power to determine such matters as rent levels and everything else. They will put up rents; they will take over all the other functions of local authorities so that local people's voices are diminshed. We shall return to this question a a later stage, but I should like now to put the amendment to a vote.</span></p>

The purpose of the amendment is to allow local authorities another year to prepare for the new financial regime. That request is not unreasonable because the change is a major one to local authority housing legislation.<br><br>
I was encouraged by the Minister's earlier comments that there will real consultation. I am sure that local authorities will ask for more time, because they will be faced with the new regulations on board and lodgings and the introduction of the poll tax at the same time as implementation of this provision. I agree with the Minister that we do not want to throw it all away. Having got the matter wrong in 1980 with the inconsistencies referred to in the consultation document, I hope that the Government are intent on getting the Bill right. That means going through the consultation procedure. I urge the Minister to delay introduction of the provision for a year to enable the consultations to take place properly, and not to crash the provision into the poll tax and board-and-lodging legislation that are already on the stocks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be even more brief. I do not like the amendment and I did not like the argument, which falls because of repetition. We have heard it before many times. There is no excuse for local authorities not complying with the new legislation. I have told the hon. Gentleman and his hon.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Steamroller I may be, but that has concentrated everyone's minds on the forthcoming vote on the Floor of the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is so convinced that he has got the matter right this time, why have the Government previously got it wrong so many times that about 50 different Acts covering local government have had to be introduced during the past nine years?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is about the 27th time that I have replied to that question. The answer perhaps is that, because we are good Christian-living members of the Government, we are not accustomed to the sort of divisiveness of some Labour-controlled local authorities that spend a disproportionate amount of their time finding their way around our legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The arguments on retraining staff and on setting up budgets should be taken seriously. The Minister is nodding, so I hope that he agrees that local authorities should not be cranked into implementing the legislation. I urge the Committee to divide on the amendment. I appeal for the
