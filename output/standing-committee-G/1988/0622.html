<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was my intention to welcome the series of measures dealing with close companies as an honest attempt at modernising the tax system, yet retaining anti-avoidance measures. The apportionment clauses are themselves anti-avoidance measures and the purpose of this clause is to abolish close company apportionment. The Government's original intention was to put a series of other anti-avoidance measures in place in the following clauses. What creates some difficulties for me is that the Government's intention has substantially changed. That is why the Government have had to go back to the Floor of the House to get the Ways and Means resolutions to which you have just referred, Mr. Crowther. In the new circumstances—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt, but I must remind hon. Members that we are now sitting. If there is any talking, they should please keep very quiet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Crowther.<br><br>
In these new circumstances, I should at least like to hear the Financial Secretary explain why we should not reconsider the position and abandon the idea of abolishing the current apportionment rules, at least for a year, to give the Government a chance to come back with considered anti-avoidance proposals rather than the very wide and probably excessively generous ones that they are seeking to put in place at the 11th hour.<br><br>
The propositions before the Committee today are clearly not the ones that were intended at the time of the Budget or even on the publication of the Finance Bill. To delete the anti-avoidance clauses in the Bill and to replace them with a lax regime is something that the Committee and the House might well regret. The Financial Secretary will have to give a clear and explicit justification for deleting the anti-avoidance clauses.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 582</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Norman Lamont)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) suggested that the Government have substantially changed their intentions on close companies and the repeal of close company apportionment. We have in no way changed our objectives. Our objective is one that my hon. Friend the Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot), among many others, had urged on us for some time. Every year in the lead-up to the Budget we have been urged to get rid of apportionment legislation because it is highly complex, bureaucratic and unenforceable. We have done that, and our revised proposals still achieve it. We had reduced the top rate of tax from 60 per cent. to 40 per cent., and the scope for avoidance was much less. We felt that if ever there was a time to get rid of apportionment, it was this year. That is why we wanted to press on. We put forward proposals that were criticised. We substantially modified them and have still achieved the same objective—to get rid of apportionment.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East asked about the anti-avoidance provisions. If it is convenient to the Committee and to the hon. Gentleman, the best place to consider those matters would be under clause 100. I do not for one minute believe that we have created an avoidance opportunity by our proposals—even in the revised form—because we have substituted a 35 per cent. tax rate for close investment companies where those companies might have had the small companies rate of corporation tax. That is the anti-avoidance mechanism—it removes the incentive to avoid tax. I do not believe that people will put their investments into a corporate vehicle for a mere 5 per cent. corporation tax advantage when there are so many other obstacles that prevent them taking their money out of a corporate vehicle.<br><br>
I say to the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East that the Government have not changed their objective. We have got rid of apportionment, as we wished, and have not created a vehicle for tax avoidance. However, we shall explore the issue in more detail when we debate clause 100. Clause 100 is to be discussed with Government new clause 45, which details the Government's revisions to the original proposals.</span></p>

MEANING OF "CLOSE COMPANY"</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 457, in page 74, line 18, leave out "and section 100 below".<br><br>
The amendment is a drafting one. The clause is a consequential of the abolition of apportionment. It concerns the definition of "close company", which is used in several places in the tax system. Broadly speaking, a company is a close company if it is under the control of no more than five persons, and for this purpose the immediate members of a family are treated as a single person. Looking at who controls a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0333">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 583</span>
company usually provides a good test of whether the underlying ownership of the company's assets and income is concentrated in a few hands. But it is possible to devise arrangements under which someone is entitled to the bulk of a company's assets and income but does not technically control it. For example, someone might have a minority interest in each company in a chain of companies, so that in total he or she would be entitled to well over half the bottom company's income and assets.<br><br>
It is right that such a company should be treated as a close company. The current definition does that by using the apportionment legislation to determine the underlying entitlement to the company's income.<br><br>
The Bill gets rid of apportionment. As the definition of a close company is linked to apportionment, we have had to substitute a new definition, but it is substantially similar to the previous one. The clause provides for that. It looks at the rights to a company's assets if it were wound up. If a few people would be entitled to over half the assets, the company is a close company. The clause deals with cases where there is a chain of companies by looking through to the rights of the ultimate owners.</span></p>

<p>The Questions that clauses 101 to 106 stand part of the Bill. I am advised that it will be convenient to do all that in one debate.</p>
<p>Does any hon. Member wish to move amendment No. 322, in the name of the hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Powell)? If not, does any hon. Member wish to move any other amendments in the group, as long as they are in the right order—amendments Nos. 323, 324, 325, 326, 327 or 328? I see that no one does.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I propose the withdrawal of the clause and of the following clauses up to the end of clause 106. I propose their replacement by new clause 45. Let me explain the background.<br><br>
It is a long-standing feature of our tax system that there are some differences in the tax treatment of similar businesses being carried on by an individual and a company, and in some respects those favour the company, although some reliefs, such as the business expansion scheme and capital gains tax annual exemption, are available only to individuals. The close company apportionment legislation reduces some of the tax advantages available to a company by imposing tax charges on the shareholders. The most important case is the apportionment power that prevents a company accumulating investment income surplus to its business requirements and benefiting from a lower rate of tax than is paid by an individual liable at the higher rates. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bridlington (Mr. Townend) is aware, apportionment is notoriously and hideously complex, and although in practice it is applied to only a small minority of close companies, it has to be borne in mind by all companies.<br><br>
Several hundred thousand close companies with investment income may be in danger, even though trading companies are generally outside the apportionment rules, because their investment income may be brought within the close company apportionment rules. For that reason, we thought it right to remove the vast majority of the half a million close companies from the scope of any special tax charge on their profits and, for the remaining 25,000 close investment companies—close companies that are not trading, but purely investment companies—to abolish apportionment in favour of a relatively simply tax charge.<br><br>
Even with the top rate of tax down to 40 per cent. there could still be an incentive for some people to hold investments in a close company so as to benefit from the lower rates of tax paid by companies. We felt it necesary to have a replacement for apportionment to avoid giving people the opportunity to reduce their tax on income and capital gains simply by placing their personal investments in a closely controlled investment company. There is general agreement that we were right to have as our objective the removal of apportionment in favour of something much more targeted, although I accept that there has been much discussion about the best way of doing that.<br><br>
The approach of the provisions in the Finance Bill is to tax close investment companies in the same way
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 586</span>
as individuals, as far as possible. The thinking behind the approach was that since the aim was to discourage individuals from transferring their investments to a close company, it made sense to tax the companies as much as possible in the same way as individuals. That would have removed the incentive to base one's personal investments in a corporate vehicle.<br><br>
The Finance Bill, as originally published, would have disallowed a number of business expenses and interest payments. However, there was some misunderstanding about the proposals. For example, with a property company, it was never intended that the expenses in relation to the management of particular properties should have been disallowed, or that interest for the acquisition of new properties should have been disallowed.<br><br>
There was some concern about the way in which we defined trading companies in the Bill. Many people believed that the definition of a close investment company would have a harmful effect on some companies which were genuine commercial undertakings, placing them at a disadvantage compared with their non-close company competitors. That is why we decided to modify the proposals in the Bill. I think that my hon. Friends will agree that that was the right thing to do.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
We could simply have looked at the points of concern, such as the expenses being disallowed, the treatment of interest and the definition of a trading company. But just to have considered and amended each of those problems in turn would have made the legislation much more complex. We wanted a simple and clean solution, and we wanted to continue with the abolition of apportionment.<br><br>
What we now propose is not out of line with the objective described by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown). Close investment companies will continue to be taxed in the same way as other companies, but will receive the normal reliefs for interest and expenses. Whatever their level of profit, they will no longer receive the benefit of the small companies rate, so they will be taxed at 35 per cent. That approach will result in rules that are much simpler than the old apportionment provisions and, indeed, our original proposals.<br><br>
To answer the point of the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East, let me tell him that the new proposals are a considerable deterrent to avoidance. Not only will someone putting his personal investments in a corporate vehicle face a 35 per cent. tax charge, but there is a further tax charge if the investor withdraws accumulated profits from the company. The 35 per cent. charge on the company, combined with the further charge when profits are withdrawn, means an overall tax charge of about 48 per cent. In case that sounds too horrendously penal, it is—as my hon. Friends will recognise—the same effective rate of tax as a person pays on the withdrawal of profits from a company in which he has shares. That is how it should be—a neutral approach. There is no longer any incentive to put one's investment into a corporate vehicle. At the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0335">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 587</span>
same time, because of the definition of a close investment company, genuine commercial activities—including property investment and dealing companies—will be treated as normal commercial companies.<br><br>
The tax rate is the same as the rate for a normal company with profits of more than three quarters of a million pounds. We propose to concentrate the benefit of the small companies rate on trading and property investment companies with small profits.<br><br>
We also propose to amend the definition of a close investment company. Such amendments will ensure that no trading company, including a dealing company, will be a close investment company. We shall also exclude property investment companies from being close investment companies. That is right, because property investment companies fulfil a socially useful purpose and it would undoubtedly have deleterious effects if we disallowed business expenses for commercial property companies. In any case, the existing apportionment provisions include special rules that recognise that property investment companies may need to retain income for the purpose of business. So their exclusion from the close investment company regime will leave them in much the same position as under the present tax regime.<br><br>
Apart from taking out companies which themselves trade, we are also proposing to widen the exclusion of companies which form part of a group which contains trading or property investment companies. Providing that the main pupose of those group companies is to support the trading or property investment activities of the group, they too will be excluded from being close investment companies. The provisions in clause 100 already go some way towards that, but the measures in the new clause are more comprehensive.<br><br>
We are proposing one further change. This concerns clause 107 which, in certain circumstances, restricts the payment of a tax credit to a United Kingdom resident individual. I shall not explain that now. I merely put it in the context of the overall changes. Essentially, the aim is to target the restriction more closely on an avoidance device.<br><br>
As I have said, our objective has not changed. Our original view was that, given our aim of securing desirable simplification while avoiding any significant cost, the best way forward was to tax close investment companies in much the same way as individuals. But having received a number of representations and having had consultations with the main representative bodies which were concerned about the proposals, we concluded that the provisions in the Bill could produce the wrong result for some companies.<br><br>
The problem arises because, as I have said, the tax treatment of incorporated businesses is in some ways more favourable than that of unincorporated businesses. So the approach of taxing a close investment company in much the same way as an individual could have placed some close investment companies at a significant competitive disadvantage.<br><br>
We always knew that there was some risk here but
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 588</span>
we thought it would be sufficiently rare in practice to be acceptable as a consequence of a major simplification of the tax system. However, in the light of consultations we were persuaded that for some companies and groups the problems would have required complete admendments. The simpler way was to get rid of the provisions relating to expenses and interest, to get rid of the distribution test and the definition of investments in relation to corporate profits and to have a single rate of corporation tax for the more narrowly defined close investment company. That enables us to sweep away apportionment.<br><br>
We are replacing 20 pages of legislation by some four pages of legislation. Furthermore, we are getting rid of some 75 pages of guidance to officials in the Inland Revenue who found the apportionment legislation almost impossible to apply. My hon. Friend the Member for Wanstead and Woodford and a number of other hon. Friends asked us to look at this matter last year. After the sweeping cuts in the top tax rates it is right to look at the plethora of rules and regulations to see whether some can be swept away in the interests of simpler, cleaner and more comprehensible legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I start from where the Financial Secretary left off? The Government's twin objectives of simplification while retaining the necessary anti-avoidance measures are probably right. Our reservations about their actions today are twofold. We are not convinced that the anti-avoidance measures that the Financial Secretary says remain in place do remain in place, and we are not satisfied that sufficient consideration has been given to the new proposition before the Committee this afternoon.<br><br>
I have some sympathy with the Government's review of the way apportionment works. The Financial Secretary is right that the rules are complex and difficult to apply. He also rightly told us that they are applied only to a small proportion of close companies. But he also reminded us—and this worries us—that they are a substantial anti-avoidance provision. Even if the rules are applied in only a few cases, they influence the decision-making of many more companies. Other companies must bear the provisions in mind and acquiesce in the possible consequences of ignoring them. Removing the apportionment legislation means that that will no longer obtain, so we must examine what replaces the regulations to determine whether it will play a similar role—but we fear that it will not.<br><br>
I have some sympathy with the Financial Secretary's view that changes in the rate of income tax and corporation tax have narrowed the scope for avoidance. I am sure that that is true, although differences exist and it could still be attractive to misuse a close company to avoid tax. Nevertheless, it is proper for the Financial Secretary to point out that the scope has narrowed.<br><br>
The Government's original proposal was to treat gains as if they had been made by individuals. I had some sympathy with that approach and I felt that the regulations that accompanied it were tight and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0336">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 589</span>
imposed a substantial and thorough new anti-avoidance regime. But the case that the Financial Secretary has made this afternoon shows that he changed his mind on the anti-avoidance regime between publication of the Finance Bill and 25 May, when the change was announced in an Inland Revenue press release.<br><br>
So it is legitimate to ask why the Financial Secretary changed his mind and, candidly enough, he has told us. He said that he and his Treasury colleagues received many representations, particularly from property companies, which were worried that the definition of a close investment company would put them at a disadvantage and lobbied him pretty thoroughly, by the look of it, to make modifications. Modification is an understatement; the government have not modified their position; they have exchanged the intended anti-avoidance proposals for a completely new, and certainly simpler, set of propositions.<br><br>
I have two fears about this. First, the new propositions cannot have been properly considered, because if the Government had intended to take this course, surely we should have been told about it at the time of the Budget or when the Bill was published. A measure may have simplicity of purpose merely because it was quick and easy to produce when the Government came under pressure from the lobbyists. A happier solution would have been to postpone consideration of the matter for a year and to deal with it next year, perhaps after publicising an intention to make changes. That would show that the matter had been considered thoroughly and that widespread consultation had taken place, not only with the lobbyists who had demanded that their interests be protected, but with others who might have an alternative view.<br><br>
The Financial Secretary has simplicity on his side, but the new proposals are so wide that it would almost be impossible to be caught by them, unless someone were exceptionally negligent in conducting his business affairs. The provision seems to be not an anti-avoidance measure but an open hole in the wall through which people may travel or not as it suits them. It appears that the original apportionment provisions, with all their faults, have been abolished and not replaced with an effective measure.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
Just in case the rules manage to catch someone and turn out to be effective, the penalties appear to be substantially less than those under the previous regime. Will the Financial Secretary tell the Committee why that adjustment was thought necessary?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) for the way in which he responded. He made his case extremely moderately, although I disagree with his conclusion and final comments.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's first point was that the close company and apportionment provisions apply to a relatively small number of companies. That is true, but, as he said, the threat of apportionment hangs
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 590</span>
over many companies—I am not sure whether he believes that a good thing. There are approximately 500,000 close companies, and if they have investment income or make losses, they may find themselves in danger of running into the apportionment provisions. We thought it right to remove that threat from the vast majority of companies, including ordinary commercial companies. The regime will still apply to the close investment company, which exists merely as a corporate vehicle for personal investment.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's main comment was that there was scope for avoidance, but he did not tell us what that scope is. I invite any member of the Committee to show me that someone will put his investment into a corporate vehicle, even if he is a 40 per cent. taxpayer, to achieve a 5 per cent. tax advantage—a 35 per cent. rate instead of a 40 per cent. rate—with all the difficulties of extracting the investment from that corporate vehicle, when further tax at an effective rate of 48 per cent. is payable. There would be no advantage in placing personal investments in a corporate vehicle. That is why the rate for close investment companies will be 35 per cent., even if they ought to be eligible for the small companies rate of tax.<br><br>
At one time some of my hon. Friends urged us to do away with apportionment and to have nothing in its place. That was one course of action open to us. But we have substituted the single rate of tax of 35 per cent.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East wondered how we could have come up with the idea so quickly after publication of the Bill and whether the proposal had been worked out. He will understand that we considered many options before publishing the Bill, and this option was always open to us. A lot of work has been done on it and we have consulted widely on it. It has been extremely well received by tax practitioners and accountancy bodies. They were critical of our previous proposals, but I have received no criticism of the present proposals.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman said that the Tories are looking after their friends in the property world.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can make speeches from the Opposition Benches as well as from the Government Benches.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman knows that not only property companies are involved. Some large close companies would have been classed as close investment companies, including, perhaps surprisingly, some international companies with household names and major financial companies. I do not think that it is a matter of bowing to narrow commercial interests. The representations that were made covered genuine issues.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East asked about penalties. It was never intended to penalise but it was intended to set the right tax rate. Forty per cent. fits only when treating companies as individuals and the 35 per cent. fits when they are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0337">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 591</span>
treated as companies. The hon. Gentleman made his comments, but most of them have been made before. There is little, if any, scope for avoidance. We are getting rid of apportionment, making matters simpler and meeting the criteria that the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East seeks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Townend <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bridlington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the major provision of simplifying our tax system and thank my right hon. Friend the Minister for listening to representations, not from pressure groups, but from professional bodies and members of the Committee who have experience in the subject. My right hon.

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
RESTRICTION ON PAYMENT OF TAX CREDITS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 459, in page 81, line 20, leave out "(6) to (8)" and insert "(3A) to (3D)".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall also consider Government amendments Nos. 460 to 463.<br><br>
I should say that the amendment to amendment No. 461, following the fall of clause 100, now has no meaning, so that will not be taken.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I mentioned this clause briefly when I described the general provisions that we are introducing.<br><br>
The clause refers to the tax credit attaching to a distribution, such as a dividend, made by a United Kingdom company. Under the existing rules, the tax credit covers the shareholder's liability to income tax at the basic rate and if a UK resident shareholder has unused tax allowances, he or she can claim payment of the tax credit.<br><br>
If no special provision were made, there would be scope for someone who controlled a close investment company to distribute its profits disproportionately to someone else who had unused tax allowances—perhaps a child—and who would be able to claim payment of the tax credit. The obvious example of that would be when the people involved were relatives. There is more than one way in which the disproportionate distribution could be made, but one possibility would be for the company to have more than one class of shares. Another would be for the controlling shareholder to waive his or her right to a dividend. Until recently there would have been no point in having a special provision intended to prevent such a diversion of a company's profits. The apportionment legislation could have imposed a tax charge in those circumstances.<br><br>
Perhaps that is another answer to the point made earlier by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown), when he asked what we
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 592</span>
were putting in instead of apportionment. The answer is not just the 35 per cent. rate, but this provision too. Before last year's Finance Act, a similar result could have been achieved by covenanting income to someone else. Last year, we introduced measures to make covenants ineffective as a means of transferring income from one individual to another. Given that we have got rid of apportionment and that last year we abolished the provisions on covenanting income, we must have a similar provision to prevent close companies being used to divert profits in a similar way.<br><br>
The clause will restrict the circumstances in which a tax credit in respect of a distribution from a close investment company can be paid to a United Kingdom resident individual. Under clause 107 as it stands the tax credit would be payable only if the close investment company had one class of ordinary share capital and the distribution was a dividend paid on those shares. If a shareholder waived his or her right to a dividend, or it was not paid to the shareholder, the amount of tax credit that could be paid to other shareholders would be reduced.<br><br>
During the consultations, it was put to us that the restriction was over-restrictive, in that it could catch cases when there was no intention to obtain a tax advantage. For that reason, we are making some changes such as that suggested by amendment No. 461. It would provide that there is a restriction only if arrangements have been entered into, which are intended to enable someone with unused tax allowances to obtain payment of a larger amount of tax credit than would have been possible if the arrangements did not exist. When the restriction applies, it may still be right to allow some of the tax credit to be paid to the individual. So the amendment provides for the restriction to be of such extent as seems just and reasonable. In the first instance, it will be for the inspector of taxes to decide whether a restriction should be made and, if so, its extent. But those issues can be taken to appeal in the normal way.<br><br>
It is not posible to provide a comprehensive description of all the circumstances in which a restriction might be made. For example, the owner of a family company might arrange for a special class of shares, paying a large dividend, to be issued to his or her children; the owner might waive his or her dividends to enable the children to obtain larger dividends; or shares held by the children may be bought by the company and, in consequence, they would receive a distribution carrying a tax credit.<br><br>
This comprehensive provision deals effectively with the problem. It contains a motive test. I have some reservations about such tests under the tax system, and I try to avoid them whenever possible. However, in the light of the strong representations that we have received on the issue, greater flexibility is something that most people involved in such matters will judge to be the lesser evil.</span></p>

<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following: Government new clause 31—<i>Value shifting: reductions attributable to distributions and disposals within a group.</i><br><br>
Government new clause 32—<i>Value shifting: transactions treated as a reorganisation of share capital.</i><br><br>
Government new clause 33—<i>Groups of companies.</i><br><br>
Government amendments Nos. 334 and 335.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: New clauses 30, 31 and 32 introduce provisions to counter devices that enable groups of companies to reduce or eliminate capital gains tax liabilities on the sale of subsidiaries. I emphasise that we are dealing not with ordinary commercial arrangements but with highly artificial avoidance schemes. They are constructed to get round existing provisions that impose a tax charge on gains when assets or companies owning them leave a group.<br><br>
The basic scheme involves stripping out of a subsidiary unrealised gains in the value of its chargeable assets by means of a tax free intra-group dividend out of artificially created profits, which some in the tax planning industry have come to describe as a drain-out dividend. In that way, the group contrives to shelter from tax what would otherwise be and effectively are realised gains on the sale of the subsidiary. That can even mean a group lending money to one subsidiary to buy an asset from another, to finance a tax-free dividend back to the group.<br><br>
In attacking those schemes, we have taken steps to safeguard ordinary dividend payments within a group, and a group will not be penalised by these provisions, for extracting profits from a subsidiary before sale, by a dividend payment that is made out of profits and reserves that have already borne tax. The key point is that we are talking about extracting gains from profits that have not borne tax. What is objectionable and what is targeted are cases when the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0341">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 599</span>
dividend is the result of transactions, which convert the crude capital gains into distributable profits on which no tax has been paid.<br><br>
Artificial they may be, but those schemes are comparatively straightforward and inexpensive to implement. They are capable of being varied in many ways to meet the circumstances of different groups. The potential loss of tax is enormous and runs into hundreds of millions of pounds. So far, the actual loss of tax has been limited, but it has been noticeable that the device of so-called drain-out dividends has begun to be publicised at conferences and in tax advice. Therefore, we have decided to act promptly to deal with the matter. New clauses 31 and 32 follow on from that.<br><br>
New clause 33 changes the definition of a group of companies for capital gains purposes. At present, a group consists of a principal company, its subsidiaries of which it owns directly or indirectly at least 75 per cent. of the ordinary share capital, any 75 per cent. subsidiaries of those subsidiaries and so on.<br><br>
The definition of ordinary share capital can include shares which have only restricted rights to the company's profits or assets. The result is that under the existing rules, a group can include companies in which the principal company has only a minimal interest. But all the companies enjoy certain tax advantages associated with membership of a group. For example, they can sell assets to each other without triggering a capital gains charge, because the transfer of the assets is treated as taking place on a no-gain no-loss basis. If one company has a minimal interest in another company, together they can be treated as a group of companies. Therefore, they can sell an asset from one company to another and benefit from the provisions applying to a group. As the transaction is treated as a no-gain no-loss transfer, no tax is payable.<br><br>
We do not believe that it makes sense to allow this to continue. We have decided to act because if we introduced new clauses 30, 31 and 32 without making changes in the definition of a group, an alternative device to that in new clause 30 would quickly be developed to shelter what are effectively gains on the sale of subsidiaries from tax. I hope that the hon. Member for Wrexham will forgive me for giving a highly simplified version of the position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. John Marek <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give a general welcome to the new clauses on behalf of the Opposition. They are necessary anti-avoidance measures, and I am glad that the Financial Secretary has seen fit to introduce them. We have no reservations about supporting the new clauses.<br><br>
As I have not studied the fine print in great detail. I hope that the Financial Secretary can assure me that the new clauses will do what they aim to do. He probably cannot give me 100 per cent. assurance; but I should like to know that the provisions have been carefully considered and that they will do what they purport to do. That is important, because if the new clauses have been decided on in the past three or four
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 600</span>
weeks, they could contain major errors. We must remember that they are new. They were not part of the Finance Bill and have not been considered carefully for the whole year. The new clauses may, we fear, have been drafted quickly; perhaps more thought will be given to them as time goes on. I am sure that it will.<br><br>
We know that tax avoidance has been going on in this area for some time. Have there been any outrageous cases of avoidance recently? If so, there would be a good case for making the legislation effective not from last Budget day, but from before then, to catch some of them.<br><br>
I should be grateful if the Financial Secretary would respond briefly to my comments. In any circumstances, we welcome the new clauses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the first point, I shall give the hon. Gentleman the best assurance that I can. The new clauses have been well researched, but, as he understands, the tax-advising industry is well developed and there are always examples of people moving on from the blocking of one loophole to consider other devices. I hope that with a much more reasonable tax system based on lower rates, there will be less of this activity. Obviously, in the corporate world tax planning will continue and people will always test the law and try to find loopholes.<br><br>
On the second point, I do not want to detain the Committee with outrageous examples, as the hon. Member seemed to invite me to do. I said that this device had only emerged recently, but that, as it was a simple device which was inexpensive for the companies to operate, we decided to act quickly.</span></p>

<li>the distributable profits of any company are chargeable profits of that company to the extent that they are profits arising on a transaction caught by this section, and</li>
<li>where any company makes a distribution attributable wholly or partly to chargeable profits (including any profits that are chargeable profits by virtue of this paragraph) to another company, the distributable profits of the other company, so far as they represent that distribution or so much of it as was attributable to chargeable profits, are chargeable profits of the other company,</li></ol>

and for this purpose any loss or other amount to be set against the profits of a company in determining the distributable profits shall be set first against profits other than the profits so arising or, as the case may be, representing so much of the distribution as was attributable to chargeable profits.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(4) The distributable profits of a company are such profits computed on a commercial basis as, after allowing for any provision properly made for tax, the company is empowered, assuming sufficient funds, to distribute to persons entitled to participate in the profits of the company.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(5) Profits of a company ("company A") are profits arising on a transaction caught by this section where each of the following three conditions is satisfied.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(6) The first condition is that the transaction is—
<ol>
<li>a disposal of an asset by company A to another company in circumstances such that company A and the other company are treated as mentioned in section 273(1) of the Taxes Act 1970 (transfers within a group: no gain/no loss), or</li>
<li>an exchange, or a transaction treated for the purposes of section 85(2) and (3) below as an exchange, of shares in or debentures of a company held by company A for shares in or debentures of another company, being a company associated with company A immediately after the transaction, and is treated by virtue of section 85(3) below as a reorganisation of share capital, or</li>
<li>a revaluation of an asset in the accounting records of company A.</li></ol>
In the following conditions the "asset with enhanced value" means (subject to section 26C below), in the paragraph (a) case, the asset acquired by the person to whom the disposal is made, in the paragraph (b) case, the shares in or debentures of the other company and, in the paragraph (c) case, the revalued asset.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(7) The second condition is that—
<ol>
<li>during the period beginning with the transaction referred to in subsection (6) above and ending immediately before the section 26 disposal, there is no disposal of the asset with enhanced value to any person, other than a disposal falling within section 273(1) of the Taxes Act 1970, and</li>
<li>no disposal of the asset with enhanced value is treated as having occurred during that period by virtue of section 278 of the Taxes Act 1970 (company ceasing to be member of group).</li></ol></p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(8) The third condition is that, immediately after the section 26 disposal, the asset with enhanced value is owned by a person other than the company making that disposal or a company associated with it.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(9) The conditions in subsections (6) to (8) above are not satisfied if—
<ol>
<li>at the time of the transaction referred to in subsection (6) above, company A carries on a trade and a profit on a disposal of the asset with enhanced value would form part of the trading profits, or</li>
<li>by reason of the nature of the asset with enhanced value, a disposal of it could give rise neither to a chargeable gain nor to an allowable loss, or</li>
<li>immediately before the section 26 disposal, the company owning the asset with enhanced value carries on a trade and a profit on a disposal of the asset would form part of the trading profits.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(10) The amount of chargeable profits of a company to be attributed to any distribution made by the company at any time in respect of any class of shares, securities or rights shall be ascertained by—
<ol>
<li>determining the total of distributable profits, and the total of chargeable profits, that remains after allowing for earlier distributions made in respect of that or any other class of shares, securities or rights, and for distributions made at or to be made after that time in respect of other classes of shares, securities or rights, and</li>
<li>attributing first to that distribution distributable profits other than chargeable profits.</li></ol></p></blockquote>

<br><blockquote><p>26B.—(1) The references in section 26 above to a reduction in the value of an asset, in the case mentioned in subsection (7) of that section, do not include a reduction attributable to the disposal of any asset ("the underlying asset") by the second company at a time when it and the first company are associated, being a disposal falling within section 273(1) of the Taxes Act 1970 (transfers within group: no gain/no loss), except in a case within subsection (2) below.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2) A case is within this subsection if the amount or value of the actual consideration for the disposal of the underlying asset—
<ol>
<li>is less than the market value of the underlying asset, and</li>
<li>is less than the cost of the underlying asset,</li></ol>
unless the disposal is effected for bona fide commercial reasons and does not form part of a scheme or arrangements of which the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, is avoidance of liability to corporation tax.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(3) For the purposes of subsection (2) above, the cost of an asset owned by a company is the aggregate of—
<ol>
<li>any capital expenditure incurred by the company in acquiring or providing the asset, and</li>
<li>any other capital expenditure incurred by the company in respect of the asset while owned by that company.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(4) For the purposes of this section, where the disposal of the underlying asset is a part disposal, the reference in subsection (2)(a) above to the market value of the underlying asset is to the market value of the asset acquired by the person to whom the disposal is made and the amounts to be attributed to the underlying asset under paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (3) above shall be reduced to the appropriate proportion of those amounts, that is—
<ol>
<li>the proportion of capital expenditure in respect of the underlying asset properly attributed in the accounting records of the company to the asset acquired by the person to whom the disposal is made, or</li>
<li>where paragraph (a) above does not apply, such proportion as appears to the inspector, or on appeal the Commissioners concerned, to be just and reasonable.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(5) Where by virtue of a distribution in the course of dissolving or winding up the second company the first company is treated as disposing of an interest in the principal asset, the exception mentioned in subsection (1) above does not apply.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>26C.—(1) For the purposes of sections 26(1A) and 26A(7) to (9) above, subsections (2) to (6) below apply for the purpose of determining in the case of any asset ("the original asset") whether it is subsequently disposed of or treated as disposed of or owned or any other condition is satisfied in respect of it.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2) References in sections 26(1A)(a) and (b) and 26A(7) to a disposal are to a disposal other than a part disposal.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(3) References to an asset are to the original asset or, where at a later time one or more assets are treated by virtue of subsections (5) or (6) below as the same as the original asset—
<ol>
<li>if no disposal falling within paragraph (a) or (b) of section 26(1A) or, as the case may be, of 26A(7) has occurred, those references are to the asset so treated or, as the case may be, all the assets so treated, and</li>
<li>in any other case, those references are to an asset or, as the case may be, all the assets representing that part of the value of the original asset that remains after allowing for earlier disposals falling within the paragraphs concerned,</li></ol>

<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, that the clause be read a Second time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall also discuss the following:<br><br>
Government new clause 40—<i>Residence of personal representatives.</i><br><br>
Government new clause 41—<i>Assessment of trustees etc.</i><br><br>
Government amendments Nos. 436 to 438.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: New clause 39 introduces rules to determine the residence status for income tax purposes of trustees in cases where a settlement has at least one trustee resident in the United Kingdom and at least one who is non-resident. It is necessary as a result of a recent decision of the House of Lords in the case of Dawson <i>v.</i> Commissioners of the Inland Revenue.<br><br>
The Dawson case concerned a settlement where one of the trustees was resident in the United Kingdom and two were non-resident. The Lords decided that the trustees were not liable to tax on the settlement's foreign income because they were not all resident in the United Kingdom.<br><br>
If the law was now left unchanged, it would be easy for a settlement with trustees who are currently all resident in the United Kingdom to escape tax merely by appointing an additional trustee who was non-resident and investing the trust funds overseas. I am sure the Committee will agree that that would not be satisfactory.<br><br>
We are therefore proposing rules which will treat mixed residence trustees as all resident in the United Kingdom if the settlor was resident, ordinarily resident or domiciled in the United Kingdom at any time when he put funds into the settlement. Otherwise, they will all be treated as non-resident. That is simple, fair and objective. It means that a settlement with a United Kingdom settlor will be taxed on its foreign income so long as the connection with this country is maintained by keeping at least
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0346">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 609</span>
one resident trustee. The settlor will no longer be able to escape tax on the income of the settlement merely by appointing a non-resident trustee. That is right, because this country can be regarded as the natural home of such settlements.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
Conversely, a foreign settlor will be able to appoint United Kingdom trustees and preserve non-resident status for his settlement, by ensuring that he retains at least one non-resident trustee. His settlement will then not be liable to United Kingdom tax on its foreign income. The proposed test will thus do no harm to British professional expertise in the administration and advising of trust, so I think that it achieves the right balance.<br><br>
When mixed residence trustees fall to be treated under the clause as being not resident—that is, when the settlor is foreign—they will also be treated as being resident outside the United Kingdom. So, when assets are transferred to such mixed residence trustees—that is, their status changes as a result of these provisions—the existing provisions relating to the transfer of assets abroad will apply.<br><br>
Briefly, the existing provisions apply when assets are transferred and as a result, income becomes payable to a person resident outside the United Kingdom. They apply both to the individual directly involved in the transfer of assets and to those who benefit from such arrangements but who are not directly involved with the transfer.<br><br>
The clause applies generally to income for the tax year 1989–90 and subsequent years. But there are transitional provisions for settlements which currently have mixed residence trustees. Because we did not make our announcment on this until 15 June and the decision was not made by the House of Lords until May, we thought it right to allow a breathing space, and I am sure that the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury will agree that that is reasonable.<br><br>
As to the foreign income of such settlements, the trustees are not taxable at present because of the Dawson decision. In some cases, they were not taxable on that income even before Dawson. But they will be taxable in future if the settlement has a United Kingdom settlor. In those circumstances, it could be considered unreasonable for the clause to impose tax on the income which has arisen in the present tax year. Accordingly, we propose giving such trustees a breathing space. If all the United Kingdom resident trustees are replaced by non-resident trustees before 1 October 1989, the settlement's foreign income will not be brought into tax. But if the trustees remain mixed—resident after that, they will all be treated as resident in the United Kingdom and will be taxable on the foreign income they have received since 5 April 1989.<br><br>
In outline, the purpose of the other transitional provisions is to ensure that the residence rules in the clause do not lead to a liability under sections 739 and 740, the provisions which counter avoidance of tax by the transfer of assets abroad, in respect of income payable and benefits received before 15 June 1989—the date on which the proposals were announced.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 610</span>
There are two particular aspects of the transitional provisions to which I should refer. First, a brief period is allowed—to 1 October—during which an individual who received a capital sum before 15 June can rearrange his affairs. Secondly, for a benefit to be taxable under section 740—that is, on a person who was not directly involved with the transfer of assets—it must not exceed what is termed the relevant income of the person resident outside the United Kingdom. For that purpose, the clause provides that relevant income includes income arising to mixed residence trust prior to April 1989—there is no reason why that should be excluded—but is restricted to income that has not been charged to United Kingdom tax. That essentially restores the pre-Dawson position.<br><br>
New clause 40 introduces equivalent provisions of mixed-residence personal representatives. They will all be treated in a similar way as resident in the United Kingdom if the deceased person was resident, ordinarily resident or domiciled in the United Kingdom at his death. Otherwise, they will all be treated as resident outside the United Kingdom.<br><br>
This arose at a late stage as a result of the Dawson case. Although we were aware of the matter and could make plans, we could not anticipate the decision. It poses some awkward choices, but our proposals are a balanced package for mixed-residence trustees and they take into account this country's professional expertise in advising foreign trusts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for his lucid explanation of the origins and purpose of the new clauses. Following the Dawson decision, the Opposition welcome the steps that the Government are taking to prevent the easy avoidance of tax. I have a few questions, on which I should be grateful for the Financial Secretary's elaboration.<br><br>
The Financial Secretary dwelt on the Government's decision to introduce a breathing space between now and 1 October during which a decision can be made to ensure that all the trustees of a settlement become foreign trustees and so escape entirely the provision of the clause. The Government seem to have decided on a reasonable compromise, but it would be good to know whether they have assessed the likely impact of that breathing space. Do they expect many trustees to arrange their affairs in that way, or do they expect the impact to be slight? If there is a considerable impact, the Exchequer could lose revenue because of the breathing space in the clause. It would be useful to know the Government's expectations of the likely use of the window of opportunity that they are making available.<br><br>
I have a second question about new clause 39, and a similar point applies to new clause 40. What happens if the settlor of the trust is foreign, and so falls within new clause 39 (1)(b), but the overwhelming majority of the trustees are resident in the United Kingdom? If only one of the trustees is foreign, the provisions of the new clause will not apply and the tax liabilities will be deemed to be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0347">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 611</span>
foreign, not United Kingdom, liabilities. Are the Government worried about that possibility?<br><br>
My last point relates to new clause 41, which the Financial Secretary did not discuss much in his introductory remarks. New clause 41(4) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"This section shall be deemed always to have had effect."</p></blockquote>
We have had interesting debates during the past month or two about retrospective tax legislation. This measure would appear to be retrospection in the extreme. It would be useful to know why the Government are introducing the definitions in new clause 41 with permanent effect from well before the Dawson decision.<br><br>
I am rather worried about those three points of detail and I shall be grateful for an explanation. However, we welcome the basic principle behind the new clauses and the Government's intention to ensure that easy avoidance is not possible. The Opposition will support the Government in putting the new clauses on the statute book.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raised three points. First, he asked about the breathing space until 1 October. I cannot predict the likely impact on revenue; that is too fine a calculation to make. If the trustees do go non-resident, the trust will still be subject to the anti-avoidance provisions in sections 739 and 740, if United Kingdom beneficiaries are given the benefits of the trust.<br><br>
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman asked what would happen if the settlor were foreign but most of the trustees were United Kingdom residents. The answer is that they would be taxed on the UK income.<br><br>
Thirdly, the hon. Gentleman asked about new clause 41 and retrospection. The new clause is retrospective, but it confirms a widely understood and accepted practice that has never been challenged. If the new clause were not retrospective, we should allow, on a technicality, trustees and personal representatives to challenge assessments that have already been made and where the tax has already been paid on final assessment. They would get a windfall benefit when there was no suggestion that the law was defective. It is not unusual to act retrospectively in such a situation. It would be wholly impractical to frame the proposals in any other way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept the Financial Secretary's explanation on the third point. Clearly, retrospection is not only necessary but entirely justified, and we support that view.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we shall also consider Government amendments Nos. 491 to 495.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This new clause, with the associated amendments to the repeal schedule, is designed to correct a technical error that has come to light in the legislation on woodlands in last year's Finance Act.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
Last year, we took commercial woodlands out of income tax and corporation tax altogether, and at the same time the new woodland grant scheme was introduced, which provides for planting grants set at levels that take account of the fact that tax relief is no longer available. Our aim was to end the anomalous tax shelter that enabled higher rate taxpayers in particular to reduce the tax payable on their non-forestry income; and at the same time to try and ensure, through better targeted grants, that the right trees were planted in the right place.<br><br>
The general rule in last year's legislation is that, for those people who were—broadly—in occupation of woodlands at Budget Day 1988, woodlands come out of tax either at the end of a five-year transitional period—that is on 6 April 1993—or, if earlier when the occupier starts to receive a woodland grant scheme grant in respect of them. In other words, during the transitional period an owner can have either tax relief or a grant, but not both.<br><br>
As we made clear the time, we intended that when a woodland came out of the tax system, no further tax relief would be due for expenditure incurred on it, either by way of a deduction from profits for general planting expenses or by way of capital allowances. In relation specifically to capital allowances, our intention was that, from the date on which a particular woodland came out of income and corporation tax, no further capital allowances would be due for expenditure incurred subsequently on that woodland, and the outstanding balance of any allowances for expenditure incurred earlier would not be made.<br><br>
The technical error that has come to light relates specifically to agricultural buildings allowances—which might be due, for example, for expenditure on making roads, building fences, or putting up forestry buildings. We have been advised that last year's legislation does not have the intended effect of preventing any further allowances or balance of allowances being given after the woodland in question comes out of income or corporation tax. The allowances, in fact, continue to be due each year until the end of the writing-down period—until 2012 in the case of expenditure incurred in 1987.<br><br>
The purpose of the new clause is to put that right and to ensure that agricultural buildings allowances will cease to be made in relation to expenditure on a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0349">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 615</span>
woodland that is no longer within tax. It is essential that we correct the error, because to leave matters as they are would mean that woodland owners whose woodlands were otherwise outside tax could go in receiving allowances against their other income, for this one form of expenditure, for up to 25 years. The new code of agricultural buildings allowances, which applies to capital expenditure incurred on or after 1 April 1986, provides a 4 per cent. a year writing-down allowance over a 25-year period.<br><br>
The new clause also has transitional arrangements, under which woodland owners who were in occupation of their woodlands on Budget day 1988 can stay within the tax system until 5 April 1993 or—if earlier—until the beginning of the chargeable period following the one in which they first receive one of the new woodland grant scheme grants.<br><br>
That means that woodlands occupied by an individual whose chargeable period is the income tax year starting on 6 April might, depending on the circumstances, come out of tax on any 6 April from 1989 to 1993. For woodlands occupied by companies, there is a wider range of possible dates.<br><br>
The new clause caters for those possibilities and, in particular, ensures that when a company has an accounting period that straddles the final cut-off date of 6 April 1993, the agricultural buildings allowances due for that period are to be apportioned and only the allowances due for the period before 6 April are to be given.<br><br>
The new clause takes effect from 20 June 1989, the day that it appeared on the amendment paper. It does not need to apply for 1988–89, because allowances due for that year cannot be affected. As for the current year, 1989–90, any individual woodland occupier whose woodlands were still within the tax system in the tax year 1988–89, but who received a woodland grant scheme grant in that year, ought, under the provisions as they were intended to operate, to have had no further agricultural buildings allowances in respect of those woodlands after 6 April 1989. But, because last year's provisions were defective, such occupiers are in fact entitled to allowances until the end of the writing-down period. We clearly have to prevent that, for the reasons that I have given. But, in all the circumstances, we do not think that it would be right to deprive such occupiers of any allowances due for the period from 6 April 1989 to 20 June 1989, when we announced our decision.<br><br>
Therefore the new clause does not need to be retrospective, except in the sense that last year's measures were because they cut off the expectation of allowances stretching on for 25 years. However, because the provision in last year's Finance Act would not have had effect until this year, only that short period might have needed a retrospective effect. We have decided to take out that short period of a few weeks.<br><br>
The new clause provides that any allowances due to woodland occupiers in that position for 1989–90
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 616</span>
will be apportioned, and they will still receive the proportion that relates to the period between the two dates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Last year, we welcomed the Government's decision to take forestry out of the tax system, and, thereby, to remove the opportunity for tax avoidance on a substantial scale, through the purchase of land and its injudicious use for forestry on a mass scale. The main debate in the Committee on last year's Finance Bill dealt with the nature of the five-year transitional period rather than the Government's aims.<br><br>
The new clause dots the i's and crosses the t's of the Government's decision and eliminates one loophole. We welcome the new clause and support its intention. It would have been anomalous and unfortunate for the Exchequer if the system had continued, whereby forestry was taken out of the tax system, but associated expenditure on forestry, buildings, roads and fences had remained in it. It is right and proper that they should be taken out.<br><br>
I have only one question, which is about the transitional period up to 5 April 1993. The Financial Secretary said that the transitional period, which applies to forestry expenditure as a whole, applies when owners occupied their woodland before or on Budget day 1988. The nub of our argument last year related to those people. However, the provisions of last year's Finance Act did not apply only to those who were in occupation of their woodland. To qualify for the continuation of the tax allowance system for five years, they had to have received approval for planting on their land before Budget day 1988.<br><br>
Subsection (4) of new clause 47 means that that same proviso has to apply, so that allowances on agricultural buildings can continue up to 5 April 1993. Therefore, to qualify for the transitional period of the allowance, people not only have to occupy their land on Budget day 1988, but they must have had approval for woodland planting prior to that date. It would be useful to have that clarification.<br><br>
The new clause is a welcome re-affirmation of the Government's desire to move away from taxation as a mechanism for the promotion of forestry maintenance and conservation, rather than, as the Government are now moving towards, a grant-making system to encourage sensible and useful forestry. The move away from the tax system and towards a well directed grant system is one that we welcome. I hope that when we consider new clause 37, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), we can examine in greater detail the merits of using a fiscal-based system as opposed to a grant-based system. Those arguments will come to the fore when we discuss that new clause.<br><br>
We believe that the Government have got the matter right and that moving away from the use of the tax system is the correct direction to take. New clause 47 represents a further step in that direction and we welcome it.</span></p>

PENSIONERS' RIGHTS TO RECLAIM INCOME TAX</div> <!-- title -->
<p>"As from 6th April 1989, income tax deducted from bank interest (under the composite rate scheme), and income tax deemed to be deducted from building society interest, shall be available for reclaim from the Inland Revenue by women over 60, and men over 65, as appropriate.".—[<i>Mr. Menzies Campbell.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
The purpose of this new clause is to establish for pensioners the right to reclaim income tax deducted at source. Non-tax paying pensioners have no chance of reclaiming tax paid on interest received from building society and bank deposits. Despite pensioners being among the poorest members of our society, their attempts at saving and earning a small income from such savings appear to be penalised. The Government's response to that proposition is to argue that the existence of national savings, on which interest is paid gross, means that there need not be any inequity. But that has not proved to be the case in the past. It appears that the Government no longer intend to keep the gross rate of national savings competitive and they seem to have taken the view that the encouragement of savings is no longer to be promoted. Indeed, the advertising of national savings no longer includes the word "competitive" when describing the rate that may be achieved.<br><br>
The current position is not as bad as last summer, because in October 1988 the interest rate on national savings was raised to 10.75 per cent. But that rise was delayed for some time and, unless there is a change of heart or policy by the Government with a guarantee to keep the rate competitive, such rises may be delayed in future with the corresponding effect on those with funds invested in national savings.<br><br>
Such matters are highly controversial among pensioners, who are most directly affected. The charity AGE Concern receives countless communications about that. I wish to refer to three, which demonstrate the extent to which pensioners feel highly aggrieved by the current arrangements.<br><br>
In July 1988, a pensioner from West Sussex stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"But what law or justification demands that a Non-Tax payer be required to pay tax on interest earned by way of investments by way of Building Society of Bank with no reclaim allowed by Inland Revenue? … I feel so incensed about the above that I cannot rest until I learn the true facts, therefore if this state of affairs could be explained to me as being equitable, with an explanation why it is so, it would greatly ease my mind. If, on the other hand you agree with my feeling of injustice perhaps you
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 618</span>
would be kind enough to perhaps tell me to whom I can direct my ongoing line of enquiry"</p></blockquote>
In February 1989, a pensioner from Gloucestershire wrote:
<br><blockquote><p>"I wonder if you or anybody can persuade the Chancellor of the Exchequer to keep to his rules that people only pay tax if their income is above the threshold, and stop taking tax on people's building society savings or similar savings, even when the threshold is not reached".</p></blockquote>
In January 1989, a pensioner from Hampshire wrote:
<br><blockquote><p>"There must be thousands of pensioners such as my wife and self whose total income is below the tax threshold and who have their life savings invested in income bonds, not from choice, but because the Government Decree in 1985, when CRT was applied to banks".</p></blockquote>
He went on to say that he is
<br><blockquote><p>"now expected to accept a lower gross return on my savings than that available to every other citizen whether working here or abroad. A simple tax exemption certificate would allow us to obtain the best gross rates available and would prevent the Treasury from abusing the monopoly National Savings were given by Parliament in 1985".</p></blockquote>
6 pm<br><br>
Those extracts may not describe precisely the legal position, but they demonstrate the substantial discontent, which I believe is justified, felt by pensioners in that position. The minimum deposit in a national savings investment account is only £5, and access to that money is available within a month. But many attractive deals are offered by building societies, which provide a high net rate. If pensioners were allowed to reclaim tax paid on such accounts, the return would sometimes be much higher than that which they receive from national savings.<br><br>
It has been calculated that a rate of 8.5 per cent., which several building societies offer, provides an annual return on a deposit of £1,000 of £85 net—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I apologise to the hon. Gentleman, but there is a growing buzz of conversation in the Room. I have raised the matter once during this sitting and I hope that I shall not have to mention it again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged, Mr. Crowther.<br><br>
The rate of interest offered by building societies in some circumstances is 8.5 per cent. On a deposit of £1,000 that would provide an annual return of £85. But if a pensioner were able to reclaim the tax deducted, the return would rise to approximately £115, which is significantly more than the gross rate of interest on national savings. That calculation applies only to accounts with minimum deposits of £500. But many building societies pay a net interest rate that is much closer to the gross rate on a national savings account. For example, the Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society, in which I have no financial interest, has an account which pays 10.5 per cent. with a minimum deposit of £2,500. Many pensioners may have savings of that amount. That is an excellent comparison because it is a postal account, similar to the national savings account, and is available to anyone in the country. The only delay
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0351">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 619</span>
is in postal communication—there is no stipulated delay of a month.<br><br>
It is clear that pensioners feel strongly about the matter and believe that national savings does not serve them well. But many use national savings because that is their only alternative. Unlike the majority of more wealthy people, they may have no other choice. It is not stating the matter too strongly to say that non-tax paying pensioners have a raw deal from the system of deducting tax at source from the interest that they receive on building society and bank deposit accounts. Many of them are poor, but they are taxed as though their incomes amounted to several thousand pounds. While national savings allow pensioners to receive interest gross, unless the interest rate is competitive, such pensioners will be at a disadvantage. It is for the Government to determine either that they will guarantee competitive rates and national savings or that they will accept the new clause and allow pensioners to reclaim the tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) to the Committee. The implication of the new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) is that the composite rate system is unfair to pensioners because many have incomes that are below the tax threshold, but they still pay tax at the composite rate which they cannot reclaim. As the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East knows, the essence of the composite rates scheme is that interest is taxed at a source at an average rate which reflects the fact that some depositers are liable to tax while others are not. There are some gainers and some losers. The purpose is to collect the equivalent amount of tax from deposit interest that would have been due if individual depositers received gross interest but were assessed individually for basic rate tax. For that reason, it follows that tax cannot be repaid.<br><br>
There are considerable advantages in the composite rate scheme, so perhaps I should say something about why it should not, or could not, be altered in the way suggested by the hon. and learned Gentleman. I remind the Committee that there are alternatives if pensioners do not wish to pay tax. The hon. and learned Gentleman referred to the interest on income bonds which is paid gross. It is possible to get gross interest in a Post Office account and through the appropriate national savings facilities. It would not be right to debate at length the rates of interest in national savings. We have already had a debate about that in the Committee. We can make different comparisons at different times, but I do not agree that national savings do not represent a good investment or offer good gross interest rate for the investor. The main advantage of the composite rate scheme is its simplicity. Most investors are saved the bother of paying tax on interest through PAYE or by direct assessment. We need think only of the enormous inconvenience to millions of people if they had to reclaim tax and correspond with the Inland Revenue about small amounts of bank interest. That would be a huge compliance burden.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 620</span>
The hon. and learned Gentleman rightly said that pensioners who are below the income tax threshold cannot reclaim the composite rate tax. He referred to their savings in building societies and blamed the Government for that. I am sure that he is aware that the building societies have operated a composite rate system for nearly 100 years. That has not deterred pensioners from saving with them. Successive Governments have agreed that the advantages of the composite rate system have outweighed the disadvantages. In recent years, the composite rate has been extended from the building societies to the banks. That has made the banks more competitive in the savings market and they have adjusted their net rates upwards.<br><br>
I am not persuaded by the Opposition's argument, given the other opportunities that are open to investors, that it would be right to abolish the composite rate system as it has enormous advantages.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend comment on one of the apparent perversities of the present system? The best advice that I can give to my constituents who are affected by the problem that has been identified this afternoon, is that they should place their money in a sterling deposit offshore. It is perverse that we have created a structure of tax incentives that encourages British savers to place their money offshore.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is certainly true, as I have noticed from the financial advice columns on Fridays and Saturdays. Whether I would give that advice to all pensioners, I am not so certain. Nevertheless, what my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) says is right. There is no way of dealing with the matter through the composite rate system.<br><br>
On my earlier point about the administrative advantages of the composite rate, which has been accepted by Governments of all political parties, it would have enormous implications, not just for the compliance on the saver, but also for the staffing of the Revenue. It would require several thousand civil servants to do what the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) suggests. When we extended the composite rate to banks, that saved about 1,000 civil servant jobs. It was estimated in 1985 that some 3,000 jobs were being saved through the application of the composite rate to building societies. It would be no exaggeration to say that about 5,000 civil servants would be required to do what the hon. and learned Gentleman suggests. That is a step which no Government could contemplate taking.<br><br>
The composite rate is an average rate. It caters for the non-taxpayer as well, but there are other avenues open to the non-taxpayer for investing his money.<br><br>
Despite the hon. and learned Gentleman's advocacy of the new clause, I cannot commend it to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The problem about a composite scheme is that there will be gainers and losers. The difficulty is that the losers, by definition,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0352">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 621</span>
will be those who are poorest. That is what gives rise to much of the aggravation and deep sense of grievance that many people feel about the present system.<br><br>
I was impressed by the Exocet launched behind the Minister by the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) whose financial expertise is greater than mine. The Minister was holed just above the water line, but did not give an adequate response to a telling point.<br><br>
On administration, surely it would not require an additional 5,000 civil servants if a scheme were to be created under which it was possible to satisfy the building society as to the age of the pensioner concerned, obtain from the building society a reclaim form, and submit that form to the appropriate quarter for repayment of the amount at stake. The Government's response to this matter, hiding as they do behind administrative convenience, does not deal with the issue of principle.<br><br>
This matter commands much interest and attention outside the four corners of the Committee. I know that many other right hon. and hon. Members in the House have strong views about it. For that reason, I do not propose to force the new clause to a vote. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</span></p>

TAX RELIEF FOR NURSERY CARE</div> <!-- title -->
<p>"(1) For the purpose of the Tax Act 1988, section 154, there shall be excluded from a charge to income tax of a benefit in kind any benefit arising to an employee from the provision by the employer of nursery care facilities to any children under 5 of the employee, provided only that such nursery facilities are available to employees of the employer generally.</p>

<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
The purpose of new clause 2 is to make provision for tax relief for nursery care. Again, many people outside the four walls of this Committee have extremely strong views on the issue.<br><br>
The performance of the United Kingdom in nursery provision is very poor. It has been said that we lie many light years behind our European partners in the provision of nurseries. We have less publicly-funded child care services than any other European Community country, with the exception of Portugal. While such figures are partly explained by the United Kingdom tradition of relying on voluntary agencies and private persons, we cannot expect such a policy to meet the considerable need for nursery provision, which is likely to continue to grow.<br><br>
There are 3.5 million children under five in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 622</span>
United Kingdom at present. Without access to good child care facilities, their parents will not have the opportunity of finding or of keeping employment. Such parents are often forced to make a choice between giving up a job or muddling through with unsatisfactory child care arrangements. State nursery provision has suffered from the squeeze on local authorities and private nurseries are often illegal, failing to meet health and safety standards, or are extremely expensive, taking them completely out of the range of many people in employment.<br><br>
The Government appear to have turned a blind eye to the new facilities that failddd to register and to meet the necessary standards. The Government's White Paper, entitled, "The Law on Child Care and Family Services", proposes to deregulate and remove any requirement for registration for facilities for the care of children over the age of five. The National Out of School Alliance, which is the body with an interest in this matter, said in its response to the Children Bill that such deregulation will lead to the lowering of standards yet again.<br><br>
The Government do not encourage the provision of private nursery care. Employees who use a workplace nursery have, since 1983, been subject to tax, as if it were a fringe benefit. The rate at which they are taxed appears to be greater than the rate at which people with company cars are taxed. That is an interesting anomaly which may, on reflection, show the importance that the Government attach to such matters.</span></p>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman say why he thinks that that is the case?</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman elaborate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have given my analysis of the figures. If the Financial Secretary has a contrary analysis, I have no doubt that the Committee will be pleased to hear it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman said that the taxation of nurseries is higher than that of company cars. He has provided no evidence of that assertion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is based on my analysis of the comparative rates. [Hon. Members: "What are they?"] I do not have them with me. That is not unknown. Sometimes Ministers do not have everything before them at any one time and have to find the opportunity of obtaining the information.<br><br>
I want to proceed with the matter of principle that is involved. Many women would like to take up careers after their years at home bringing up children, but cannot find a nursery to care for their children or cannot meet the cost. We are approaching what is called the demographic trough, in which the number of people available for employment is liable to be much less than is necessary to meet the requirements of industry and commerce.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Taylor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Esher)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman clarify whether he said that there was a Democrat trough?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I doubt that the hon. Gentleman's hearing would qualify him under new clause 1 for certain reliefs. He should watch my lips—the word I used was "demographic".<br><br>
New clause 2 seeks to create a tax relief that would be of great advantage to skilled workers, for instance, who want to return to work. There is a substantial shortage of people with skills in many areas of the south-east. That will become greatly exacerbated when the demographic trough is reached.<br><br>
We do not pretend that tax relief is the complete solution to the problem, but it is an obvious starting point. Hon. Members receive many representations from constituents about that. It is a matter of great anxiety to many people and the Government should display some flexibility. Not only would that put more money in certain people's pockets, but it would encourage people with useful skills to return to the employment from which they are presently discouraged. For that reason, the new clause should commend itself to the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The new clause seems to be an example of the Democrats—or the Liberal Democrats as they may soon be calling themselves—starting out with a good idea but ending up in the wrong place. Although the provisions of subsection (1) of new clause 2 are ones with which Labour Members agree, we cannot endorse the provisions of subsection (2). I hope that at a later stage in our proceedings we shall have the opportunity to discuss specifically the tax on the deemed benefit of workplace nursery provision for employees. It is an important issue and is worthy of considerable debate. The matter must be dealt with entirely and specifically within an analysis of the deemed benefit issue in respect of nursery provision.<br><br>
Unfortunately, the Democrats have mixed up that issue with the much broader issue of tax relief for child care expenses in general. There are three problems with the proposal. First, it would allow potentially a relief against income tax of more than £2,000 for an individual with one child. For an individual with two children, the tax relief would be twice that amount. Secondly, the new clause does not discriminate between the rich and the less well off. It would be possible, under the provisions, for someone like the Duchess of Westminster to claim tax relief on the employment of a nanny. The Democrats may regard that as a priority, but it is certainly not the way in which we would wish to use scarce Exchequer resources.<br><br>
Thirdly, the new clause fails to take into account the principal mechanism whereby assistance can be given for child care, which is to ensure that good quality nursery provision by employers, local authorities and voluntary organisations is made available on a much wider scale than it is at present. Furthermore, child benefit should properly reflect the costs of bringing up a child, instead of being frozen at an inadequate level as it is at present. The new clause would use tax relief instead of dealing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 624</span>
with those problems. Therefore, we cannot support it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Normam Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that we shall return to that subject before our proceedings are concluded. Therefore, I hope the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) will forgive me for not replying fully to him. I cannot accept his argument, either as it applies to day nurseries or to tax relief for child care generally when people employ someone to look after their children.<br><br>
We have said many times that this is not a new view of the Government but the position that has applied in the tax laws for many years. The use of a day nursery is obviously a valuable benefit in kind, so it should be treated as such and assessed to tax. The availability of child care facilities helps people to get to work, but the tax system generally does not subsidise the method of getting to work any more than it subsidises the cost of travel to work. We want to encourage child care facilities at work but there is no evidence suggesting that such facilities are not increasing all the time. Many firms are developing those and if they want to attract married women back to work, they must ensure that facilities are available.<br><br>
There is some recognition of day nurseries in the tax system. For example, there are capital allowances for equipment. Running expenses are tax deductable. In passing, I should say that for those earning less than £8,500—as the argument is often advanced for part-time workers—the benefit is not taxed. When I refer to benefits being taxed, it is only the element of subsidy that is taxed. If people paid for the nursery facilities, those would not be taxed.<br><br>
There is no evidence that the treatment in the tax system, which has prevailed for many years, is discouraging married women from returning to work. We have the highest number of married women in work of practically any country in Europe.<br><br>
On the second part of the new clause, I am very surprised that the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury put forward proposals for subsidising the employment of people looking after one's children. Self-evidently, as the hon. Gentleman said, that would benefit the better off to some extent and there would be enormous dead-weight costs, so it could not conceivably be regarded as a sensible policy to pursue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Diane Abbott <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In common with the rest of my party, I will not support the new clause. The Minister said that the Government's view on not extending tax relief to payments for nursery care is not new. However, because of the manpower problems that many companies are facing in the south-east, the position is different. Many companies, including clearing banks and the Civil Service are anxious to bring women back into the work force, and the old Government view will not do as we are facing a new demographic situation.<br><br>
The Minister boasted about Britain having the highest number of married women workers in Europe. Women must have their children looked after, often in unfortunate conditions. Many child
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0354">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 625</span>
minders are untrained and nurseries are unpleasant. Many of those married women work because they have to do so and would be very glad if the Government made it possible for them to have decent levels of child care. Things often look different from Hackney than from the rural suburbs.<br><br>
My hon. Friends say that £40 a week is a lot to spend on child care, but I do not agree. If we want a decent nanny, she must be paid a decent wage. We should not encourage women to employ nannies for anything less than a decent living wage.<br><br>
Fourthly, some of my hon. Friends properly raised alternatives to tax relief for nannies, such as nurseries at the place of work and child benefit. Many women who vote Labour and many who vote Conservative maintain that however marvellous workplace nurseries or state nurseries are, they still prefer to make their own arrangements for a nanny or a childminder in their own homes. Government policy should take account of that.</span></p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by the notion of a rural suburb.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Abbott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not prepared when I made those comments. I meant a leafy suburb.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are all better informed, if none the wiser, as a result of that intervention. Plainly, some consideration will have to be given to the matter at a later stage. On that basis, it would be unhelpful to try to take it further.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</span></p>

EXCISE DUTY RELIEF ON HYDROCARBON OIL</div> <!-- title -->
<p>"In the Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979, section 9, subsection (2)(b) after "article", delete the rest of the subsection and insert: "and;
<br><blockquote><p>(c) use in the bench-testing of an internal combustion piston engine during the research, development, manufacture or preparation of such engine or any part thereof by a manufacturer of motor vehicles or of motor vehicle engines or parts thereof or by any organisation engaged in such engine research and development,</p></blockquote>
but do not include except as provided in subsection (2)(c) above the use of oil as fuel or, except as provided by subsection (3) below, as a lubricant.".".—[<i>Mr. Anthony Coombs.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre Forest)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
I shall be brief, if not positively staccato, in moving the new clause on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, North (Sir T. Skeet) and of 55 supporters of the early-day motion relating to it, and other interested organisations such as the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.<br><br>
The purpose of the new clause is to extend excise duty relief under the Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979 to fuels used for the static vehicle testing and research which is necessary in the motor industry.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 626</span>
Those in the motor industry regard the present situation as a tax on innovation. They argue that when the Government passed that Act they did not intend to impose the duty on fuel used for processes necessary for manufacture. They argue that testing, on either static or track vehicles, can be regarded as a necessary part of the vehicle manufacturing process, particularly in a commercial market in which the demands for quality, efficient and rugged engines are constantly increasing and engines are required to be fuel-efficient and environmentally sensitive.<br><br>
The organisations argue that if the duty is removed for testing purposes, policing problems can be overcome by dyeing the fuel a certain colour—as diesel fuel is now dyed when used for engine testing, thereby making the duty payable on it less than for other diesel fuel—and by confining the use of such fuel to test centres, which could be registered and where all the coloured fuel could be stored.<br><br>
The Revenue cost of the proposal is estimated at £3 million a year. It would assist British-based companies with vital research and development in improving engines for the motor vehicle industry, whose exports are about £200 million a year. The new clause is so restricted as to include only static, not track, testing. It is a worthwhile measure and I commend it to the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the new clause but wish to ask the Economic Secretary a few questions. The Opposition place great store by the industry of this country. The new clause would certainly help the motor industry, which needs help in every possible way.<br><br>
First, I should like to know whether other countries in the Common Market give any relief on fuel and, if so, whether the net tax that the industry there has to pay for testing engines is more than in this country. If countries such as France and Germany give more relief, thus giving French and German industry an advantage, the Government should seriously consider accepting this new clause.<br><br>
Secondly, if the case were made that relief should be given for vehicle testing, could it be given? I know that, for example, diesel which is not used on roads is coloured red and one would have thought that it would appeal to the Conservative party to colour fuel blue if it were to be used for vehicle testing. My subsidiary question to the Economic Secretary is whether it is administratively possible to provide such relief.<br><br>
Thirdly, if such relief were given, would it lead to more claims in all sorts of other areas by other industries? How big is that problem, and is it confined to the motor industry? If the Government give way on this issue are they likely to be faced with another 25 new clauses to cover other aspects in next year's Finance Bill?<br><br>
The Opposition have some sympathy with the new clause because we do not want our industry to be disadvantaged in relation to the industries in other countries of the Common Market. Therefore, if the Economic Secretary does not want to accept the new clause, I hope that he will assure us that there will be no disadvantage to British industry.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 627</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Peter Lilley)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand and sympathise with the intention of the new clause that was spoken to so eloquently by my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs), but I must ask my hon. Friends to resist it. Historically, petrol duty has always been charged on the product and not on the use to which it is put. That provides certainty for the industry, minimises the extent of official intervention in its activities and reduces the control costs for both industry and Customs. By his reference to the need to colour petrol, my hon. Friend showed that there would be problems of control and, inevitably, that means placing a burden of compliance on industry which we do not wish to impose.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) referred to conditions in other European countries. I understand that in most of those countries little or no relief of this sort is given. West Germany, which has often been instanced in the past as a country that gives generous relief of that sort, has recently withdrawn its former liberal relief for bench testing of motor car engines, so the argument about competitiveness may be diminished. The hon. Gentleman asked whether colouring of fuel was possible for the policing of this proposal. I imagine that it is possible, but we dont want to go down that route of taxing hydrocarbons by the use rather than the nature of the product.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Wrexham asked about the cost. My estimate is double that of my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest—£6 million as the new clause stands. I imagine that it would be hard to ring fence it merely for bench testing. Certainly, there would be subsequent demands for road testing of motor vehicles and it would be hard to see the logical of stopping there. Whether there would be demands from other industries for similar reliefs is hard to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 628</span>
say, but the chances are that they would emerge as we know from our experience of previous Finance Bills.<br><br>
We ask the Committee not to accept the new clause although we understand and sympathise with the desire to encourage research and development in the motor industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned £6 million as being the potential cost, but he may have been thinking about extending the relief to track testing as well as to static tests.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coombs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There may be some disagreement about that.<br><br>
A principal reason for tabling the new clause was to ensure that research and development in the engine industry of the United Kingdom was not placed at a disadvantage, principally with its EEC competitors. If my hon. Friend the Minister can assure us that it will not be a disadvantage and that countries such as West Germany have withdrawn their relief on the excise duty for this kind or fuel or its equivalent, I shall seek the Committee's leave to withdraw the motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Was that a request to withdraw the motion? It seemed conditional and as such I cannot accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coombs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the Minister made out a case that British industry was not at a competitive disadvantage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</span></p>
