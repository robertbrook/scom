</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall probably reiterate what was said this morning because I arrived late.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I came into the Room towards the end of this morning's sitting, when I learnt that clause 30 includes the promised provision which allows the Secretary of State to make orders that cover the capital expenditure of local authority controlled and influenced companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We knew what the Government's reaction to our amendment would be. The consultation paper, "Local Authorities' Interests in Companies", published in June last year, made it clear that the Government believe that the capital transactions of both types of company defined in clauses 57 and 58 should count against the appropriate control total of the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite many responses registering anxiety from individual authorities and their associations, the Government have not moved on influenced companies, nor have they responded to our arguments today. It is apparent that both types of company are to be lumped together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was predictable that the Government would insist on the capital transactions of controlled
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>608</span>
companies being counted as capital expenditure of the controlling authority. The company is in effect an arm of the authority, which can relatively easily exert its power to control decision making. The argument for excluding influenced companies is not that they should be seen solely as independent, but that, by definition, the authority does not have control, only influence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legality of authorities' accounting arrangements depending on the actions of bodies over which they genuinely have no control is questionable. Even if a contract exists, and conditions are included in leases, a breach of contract on the part of a company would render the authority in breach of the law. That is a most unusual and unsatisfactory position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 58, it would not be difficult for a company to float into and out of the influenced category. Authorities will have to become involved in much additional work, checking whether the companies that they deal with are influenced, and ensuring that contractual protection exists, pursuant to the duty imposed under the order to be made under the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Problems are more likely to occur when a company moves into the influenced category. The duty could have arisen, and the authority's capital arrangements thereby affected to its detriment, without the authority knowing about it. If the Government's purpose is to avoid circumventing controls on local authority capital expenditure, it is difficult to envisage how an authority could use an influenced rather than a controlled company to do that. Enormous ingenuity would be required and there is hardly any evidence of abuse that justifies the Government's line. My hon. Friends and I will oppose the clause because of the Government's attitude to the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government must take account of the role of passenger transport executives in providing services in their area. That is why the reference to passenger transport executives should be removed from the Bill. If it remains, it will be a retrograde step. The Government are not taking seriously the service that passenger transport executives provide. I speak from experience of the work of the West Yorkshire passenger transport authority, to which the Minister referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State said that the West Yorkshire enterprise board was an efficient, well run organisation. The same applies to the passenger transport executives. It is against that backcloth that we propose that they should be removed from the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision has been taken on that issue, but if the Minister would give us an assurance that there will be some protection for passenger transport executives, we would have a straw to clutch at. People in local authorities who are actively involved with the passenger transport executives would welcome a warm assurance that those organisations will not be subject to the cut and thrust and cold application of the Bill. Failing such an assurance, we shall oppose the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0757">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>609</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) does not consider that we are opposed to passenger transport executives. The real issue is how they should be treated in our discussions. I believe that if they are the creatures of local government, they should be under the same controls as local government. If they are not, they should be under the controls that we apply to independent companies. There should not be anything special about them. That would accord with what the hon. Gentleman said about efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem about saying that someone is efficient is, as I have discovered after many years in private business, that anyone who runs anything says that it is extremely efficient. That is a fact of life. It is true of the private and public sectors. The difference between them is that, in the private sector, the claim can be challenged. Somebody can say, "I will be more efficient than you, so I will take you over." or, "I will be more efficient than you, so I shall demand a large stake in your company and make sure that you run the show better." The difficulty with the public sector is how to guarantee that efficiency in circumstances where a takeover is not available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tried to make sure that the public can judge the performance of any of these bodies properly. We say that if a local authority creates and controls a business which is an extension of itself, that business should be treated as an integral part of the authority. If the authority creates a freestanding, independent body, it should be treated as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the hon. Member for Normanton complimented the West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive because its director general is a former Department of the Environment civil servant. That is doubtless why it is so efficient. But I am sure that he would want his performance and that of the business itself properly monitored. That cannot happen if people are ambivalent about their relationship with the public control system. They are either outside it or within it, and I very much hope that Opposition Members will support our view that it is much better to have—to use a popular phrase which I hate—a level playing field. One needs to know who is in the business, and who is out of it, who is controlled by the local authority and who is not, so that one can ensure that the rules apply in every case. That is what clause 30 makes clear, and there is no reason for any well-run PTE to be worried about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Knowsley, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have followed the Minister's argument carefully. While I do not necessarily agree with his conclusions, there are interesting parallels with the Government and quasi-independent organisations. For example, the Housing Corporation was until recently wholly financed by central Government but operated within a framework laid down by the Minister's own Department. It financed independent housing associations of various kinds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is an intervention, not a speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>610</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to my conclusion, Mr. Hunt. The point about the Housing Corporation is that one can measure its efficiency within those parameters. Does the Minister accept that it ought to be equally possible for a local authority to make that kind of judgment about organisations that are associated with it, although not part of it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth) will accept that my comments are not motivated by party political considerations. My local county council is dominated by the Conservative party. It always assured me that a number of its activities were extremely efficient and could not be carried out by an alternative means. When compulsory tendering came in, it was obliged to go out to private enterprise and discovered that it had not been as efficient as it had thought. The council had honestly thought so and had measured its performance by the best measurements available, but the discipline of the market proved that such was not the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for the public to know by what judgment these businesses are measured. Are they to be measured by the judgments of the market, as the independent companies should be, or are they part of local government, in which case the measurements are different?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Knowsley, North, that there are mechanisms for trying to measure such things. They are different. They are not always as efficient in one way as in another and they have certain advantages and disadvantages, but it is important that the public should know whether a company is in the private sector. The regulations and rules should apply to them if they are in the public sector. The trouble is that some companies have seemed to be in the private sector when they have in fact been in the public sector. They have therefore escaped the disciplines of the marketplace and of capital controls. I ask only that we should distinguish between the two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's example applies to the passenger transport authorities involved with the deregulation of public transport. Competition is there, but the PTA is part of the transport service in an area. As the Minister knows, private operators operate within the framework of the PTA. It is clear that thought must have been given to PTAs, because the notes on clauses refer to passenger transport executives, saying that the matter should be given special consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We said this morning that, asking an organisation such as the West Yorkshire passenger transport authority to adjust to the capital and revenue expenditure as suggested in the Bill would be quite unfair. There is merit in asking for special consideration to be given to the passenger transport authorities. Failing that, the Committee should divide on the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Gentleman, but I do not think that we are so far
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0758">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>611</span>
apart. The truth is that PTEs are clearly within the public sector. They are not independent bodies. They are protected from the rigours of the marketplace in various ways by the nature of their relationship with local authorities. Therefore, they must come within the sensible capital and financial arrangements for local authorities. I do not see how they can be excluded unless there is a new sort of body, controlled neither by local authority arrangements nor by arrangements made for private companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot achieve what the hon. Gentleman wants without saying, as does the hon. Gentleman's amendment, that PTEs should be outside capital finance control. That is what the amendment proposes and opposition to the clause is aimed at that. I am afraid that I cannot do that. It would not be good for the PTEs. The PTEs could operate efficiently and effectively if they had proper controls, if there was proper comparison and if people do know that returns, accounts and spending controls were necessary. I do not see how they can be excluded in that way. Therefore, I ask the Committee to support the clause. Otherwise, we should be suggesting that some bodies would have no accountability under reasonable controls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some authorities would be neither public nor private and would escape the disciplines that we all know to be necessary. Any of us who runs a private business realises how important those disciplines are. Without market disciplines in private enterprise, we would become lazy and not use our capital and resources to the best purpose. Similarly, unless the public sector has the pressures of those controls, from local or national government, we should not be doing our job as well as we could. I would like the PTEs to be supported by the clause, which will ensure that they, too, come under the disciplines that are good for us all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to underline what was said earlier today by my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley). Once we get into the tangled web of clause 31 and the intricacies of capital expenditure, we must inevitably take another step, and then another to unravel that web. We saw in the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980 and the plethora of regulations culminating in last year's announcements relating to advance purchase and deferred purchase deals, the difficulties that any Government may get into once they become enmeshed in the minutiae of local authority capital expenditure. Those of us who have been in local government for many years—I served for 18 years—took much of that time to understand that, and I am not sure that I could put my hand on my heart and say that I understand every aspect of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is just as well, because the fewer people there are who understand it, the more likely it is that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0759">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>613</span>
local government will find some way around the regulations in the Bill, not to do silly things, but to ensure that houses and schools are repaired and improvements are made to the environment. The only way in which that could be done previously was to make capital investment in retaining and improving what exists—the Prime Minister described it as our heritage. That is why we are worried about the clause and have tabled these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that the Government provide clarification and to remove some of the more destructive parts of the clause. It is nonsense to place direct labour organisations in a less competitive position than those with which they must compete. The regulations relating to capital expenditure that will put them in a disadvantageous position not only infringe acceptable practice, but may warrant investigation in the light of EEC competition policy on DLOs and the way in which expenditure on plant and equipment is treated compared with what happens in respect of their competitors in the private sector. The boot may be on the other foot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried that the proper practices that have been defined in codes of practice for accountancy organisations—and which have been accepted for donkeys' years—are being laid on one side as the policy on capital is now being readjusted and redefined. For example, the word "enhancement" is used in connection with the environment instead of those acceptable words that we have used in the past when judging whether expenditure should be capitalised. The words "repair and maintenance" are omitted from the clause and the term "enhancement" replaces the word "improvement".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to get bogged down in minutiae and examine the dictionary to see whether words mean what we say they mean, but I believe that there is a considerable difference between the meaning of "enhancement" and the meaning of "improvement". That difference is significant as it relates to whether local authorities can continue their perfectly legitimate and acceptable practices. It seems that the Bill will rule out of order those accountancy procedures that have been acknowledged as acceptable for years, and the guidelines for repair and improvement of property that have been included in such expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seek justification of the reason why the changes are being introduced and why past definitions are considered unacceptable. What is the intention behind the provisions? We are not interested in the argument of Conservative Members about the unacceptable face of local government. How will the provisions affect the day-to-day lives of people who want local government to sustain the value and the quality of the fixed and physical environment, such as school buildings, roads and the housing stock?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Bill improve the value and quality of life, and not merely increase the monetary value of those assets, which is encompassed by the term "enhancement". Those assets are not simply fixtures that can be deemed to raise money; they are living and breathing facilities used by people daily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

What do the Government envisage will be the consequence of their action? Why have the changes been introduced, other than to fulfil the Secretary of State's declared aims of reducing the public sector, of squeezing out community democracy and of ensuring that people will inevitably turn to private enterprise to satisfy their needs because the public sector will not be in a position to do so?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Which major public finance and accountancy organisations considered that a redefinition of "proper practices" was required in clause 55(4)? Surely the Government can justify the clause. There must be another purpose behind it, other than the Government's political ideology of attacking public investment as opposed to private investment. They must justify the measure, so that people do not believe that vindictiveness has been carefully and quietly built into the Bill to control how local authorities respond to need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not merely a question of ensuring that the definitions do not make economic and financial improvement the sole objective. We must be aware of the consequences of our actions on, for example, repair and maintenance. If authorities cannot capitalise repairs and maintenance as they have in the past—clear procedures are laid down—they have two choices. They can allow properties to deteriorate or, in the case of resources such as schools, they can try to rationalise to the point where a system of shiftwork is introduced. That is the logical outcome of the direction in which we are moving, and I put forward the suggestion with trepidation, in case it appears in the next Adam Smith Institute bulletin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to housing, we shall debate later the impact of the ring-fencing arrangements on rents. A normal householder can make moderate and reasonable changes to his property by borrowing or extending his mortgage. If that is not possible, people will have to save long enough to be able to repair the roof. The Bill must provide a definition of "substantial" changes, or that will be a matter for conjecture in years to come. The word appears repeatedly and we seek to remove it, because we believe that the existing framework is adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the definition that local authorities will have to deal with? Does it mean making a roof watertight? Does it cover the provision of aids and the adaptation of premises for people with disabilities? In many authorities, that is done through capital as part of the housing programme, but it would be ruled out by the clause and could not be carried out with the social services allocations, which have been reduced to such a level that, to build an elderly people's home, even a large authority would have to use two or three years' social services allocations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By using capital resources imaginatively, authorities have been able to cushion the impact of what would otherwise have been a disaster for those who are not articulate, who are not here today and who cannot raise their voices, as the friends of Conservative Members can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is no longer the sale or lease of parking meters or selling off the taps in the town hall.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>615</span>
Whatever loopholes existed and whatever imaginative schemes people were forced to undertake were ruled out a year ago by the Secretary of State. Conservative Members could make hay with such deals, but they are excluded by the Bill. We are dealing now with straightforward practices that have allowed authorities to use not only creativity, but common sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the ironies of recent changes, which are reinforced by the clause, is that it often costs local authorities more to find ways round the restrictions than it would have cost them to act prudently like anyone in the private sector. It will be interesting to see whether, as a logical consequence of opting out, schools and hospitals will be able to raise money on the market, rather than being restricted by what happens in local authorities and health authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sheer hypocrisy to allow different practices for exactly the same provision, simply because institutions rest in the private rather than the public sector. That was shown in our debate just before Easter, when the Meadowhall shopping, sports and leisure complex in my constituency was mentioned. Had the complex, without the shopping centre, been undertaken by the local authority, several years capital allocation would have had to be used to provide recreation facilities that could happily be paid for by money raised on the private market to meet the needs of those who could afford to use them. There is nothing wrong in such facilities being provided in the private sector but, equally, there is nothing wrong in their being provided in the public sector, or jointly, as was suggested this morning. The absurdity of the present arrangement is that, once something has been provided in the public sector, it is seen as squeezing out investment in productive industry whereas when it is done by the private sector, it is not. Private health care would not damage investment, public health care would; private education would not, public education would.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These matters are relevant to the clauses before us this afternoon for we are having to decide whether we can regulate certain functions through the democratically accountable arena in a way that we cannot when they are in the private sector. We must be able to challenge the ideology of the provisions. People outside want to know that repairs and improvements will be done and that physical conditions will be improved by those they elect for the job, and not simply as prescribed by a Committee of the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We never get down to debating the consequences of such decisions, or talk in Committees of the House about what they mean to individual men and women when they seek redress or want improvements. We talk always of technicalities. Of course the clauses are technical and difficult. There are intricacies in the managing of capital budgets and we want to debate them, but our real objective must be to discover the consequences of what we are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, as is likely, the consequences are reductions of millions of pounds in the spending capacity of local authorities they will not be made in spending on projects that Conservative Members would describe
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>616</span>
as "loony" or outside the norm of local authority activity. It is basic provision that will suffer. In authorities such as Manchester, as much as half the capital programme could be cut. In authorities such as the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham—in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley)—the figure is some £23 million. In so far as we can estimate it, the impact on London boroughs of the restrictions being laid in the Bill will vary from under £3 million to £32 million. Those reductions represent real money. It does not matter whether the authority affected is Tory, Labour or SLD controlled. The impact on individuals will be the same, in that they will remove the capacity and flexibility that has existed until now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in that spirit, rather than by a softly, softly catch a monkey approach, that Conservative Members should justify the further tightening of the noose on an already strangulated local authority capital investment system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert B. Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hertfordshire, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One thing that unites the Committee is the importance of this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Mr. Trippier), and the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) spoke of the deficiencies of the present system and of the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980. I support the system, as a concept at least, as it replaced an extraordinary edifice of individual project controls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I served as finance chairman of a local authority before the passing of that Act and had to go to the Department of the Environment—as Scottish authorities had to go to the Scottish Office—to seek sanction for each and every approval. I thought that replacing that system with the overall block allocations of the Act was a step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it extraordinary how inflexible many local authorities are in their approach to that system. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) referred to social services allocations. There are no such things, because authorities which are social services authorities are frequently authorities for something else, too. For example, under the present system a county authority could vire between its social services, transport and education allocations. I have always thought that local authorities would welcome such flexibility because the allocations were only indicative allocations. But, no. Local authorities have tended to regard them as the tablets of stone laid down by the relevant Departments and, in practice, little virement has taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The deficiencies of the 1980 Act were not in the concept, which was definitely an improvement, but in how some local authorities—primarily but not exclusively Socialist-controlled ones—tried to bypass any form of capital control by various dodgy mechanisms. That is why my right hon. Friend has had to introduce the clause and the proposals ensuing from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One problem which does not seem to be covered—I hope that my right hon. Friend will comment on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0761">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>617</span>
this—is that of section 52 agreements with developers either to contribute towards or to fund the whole of certain capital or revenue projects for the benefit of the community, as a condition of obtaining planning permission. For example, in my local authority, a developer who received permission for a shopping centre has agreed to contribute towards a pedestrianisation experiment. Another who currently seeks planning permission for a shopping development is being asked to contribute towards the dualling of a major road that runs through Hemel Hempstead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A third example is one about which I feel very strongly. I have campaigned for a long time for a pedestrian crossing in Adeyfield road to enable children from Broadfield school to get safely from their homes to school. A developer who has been given planning permission in the area has agreed to provide that crossing. That will be a contribution to the local authority. But, I am sad to say, the Labour and Alliance-controlled county authority refuses to allow the pedestrian crossing, even though the developer will provide the money. That is absolutely crazy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps my right hon. Friend can tell me whether such finances supplied under section 52 agreements come under the capital expenditure control system? If so, that will create considerable problems for authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may refer the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, West (Mr. Jones) back to his point about virement between different headings. He said that in principle he agreed with the block grant system. But does he agree that it is totally impracticable? If resources were switched from social services to education, that would have a catastrophic effect the following year on social services. In practice, it could not be done. Did the hon. Gentleman try that when he was chairman of a finance committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman. I was an opposition spokesman on a Scottish local authority controlled by the Labour party. One thing for which it campaigned was the freedom to vire. Often it underspent on the allocations for transport projects, as they are difficult to bring on tap at a precise time because of the vagaries of the planning system. Therefore, it wanted to use some of that money for projects which were easier to plan, such as old people's homes, and that could be slotted relatively quickly into the design and building system. As I said, I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman. The section 52 agreement money is important. It is increasingly the price paid by developers for getting through controversial planning applications. I do not understand why the community cannot benefit in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problems are those of anticipation rather than reality. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) was really
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>618</span>
saying that he did not want such matters placed under our proposed controls, lest that might restrict spending. The truth is that a local authority will benefit from a specific activity or proposal for capital spending. Therefore, what the amendment seeks to exclude would be better not excluded. I see no reason for trying to exclude the issues in the amendment from our proposals unless the hon. Gentleman has such a sad view of the Government's attitude towards local authorities that he feels they will not provide the money. I assure the hon. Gentleman that that is not a proper assessment of what the Government have done in the past nor what they will do in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) does not like that because it hurts him to know the truth. When I see the hon. Gentleman reading his papers and chortling I know that he is trying to stir up resentment and yet he fails to stand up and explain that resentment. The hon. Gentleman's resentment is part of his nature and comes from a desire to complain about what might happen to him, and the fear that it will be something horrible. Nothing horrible will happen to the hon. Gentleman. The purpose of the legislation is to make things better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister will describe as horrible what has already happened in terms of capital investment cuts. There has been a 40 per cent. overall cut in local authority capital investment allocations and a cut of over 70 per cent. in direct investment in public sector housing. Would the Minister describe those cuts as beneficial, despicable or just unfortunate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would describe the hon. Gentleman's comments as selective. I would like the hon. Gentleman to go back to the days when the right hon. Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Healey) was Chancellor of the Exchequer. The total failure of the Labour Government to keep the economy under control meant that the international community forced cuts upon them. That Labour Government did not cut current expenditure, which might have lost the odd vote or two, they severely cut capital expenditure across the board. The Labour party has nothing to say to anybody on capital expenditure. When in Government it had the worst record of any Government in the Western world. Capital expenditure was cut again and again because temporary electoral success was wanted rather than giving permanent support to the infrastructure of Britain. That is why I was annoyed by an earlier comment about the declining infrastructure in Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The infrastructure in Britain has received more support from this Government in developing the economy than from any Government for many years. Opposition Members dare not—unless they are ignoring history—talk about infrastructure because we are now paying for years of Labour neglect for party political purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I do not know how Opposition Members dare to speak about water, which is a business that they destroyed by their refusal to spend on things that would not provide votes but to spend on things that would buy votes.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brightside tried to suggest that we should talk about capital spending in a curious new way. The hon. Gentleman said that we should enhance the present position where, to gain advantage, local authorities are able to claim as capital spending that which anywhere else would be current expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am all for the sort of spending that the hon. Gentleman spoke of. I want to ensure that our capital investment is properly kept up. I am one of those who believe that a person should paint the outside of his house to stop the wood rotting. It is important year by year to keep proper spending on capital invested. The hon. Gentleman is right about that. What I do not favour is pretending that current expenditure is capital expenditure so as to avoid a proper statement of accounts. The issue is how accounts should be stated rather than how much should be spent. No doubt the hon. Member for Brightside and I will argue in future about how much money should be available for various ways of spending by local authorities and by the Government. That is quite reasonable. What we should not argue about is the naming of that expenditure. We should not argue about whether an activity that is known universally as current spending should, in local government terms, be called capital spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My difficulty is in not knowing whether the Government have gone far enough. I must say to the hon. Gentleman that, as someone who came from private industry, I am unsure whether I would have allowed such a free rein as the clauses allow for describing as "capital" the various spendings in the business that I ran. I have always believed that it is important to ensure that one makes the distinction
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>620</span>
between real capital expenditure and real current expenditure to ensure that accounts are properly kept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall have to ask the Minister to clarify that. In his industry, would it have been prudent to lease equipment or cars in the way that most private enterprises currently do but which increasingly has been forbidden to the public sector? Does he feel that that type of example is appropriate if what he thought was the prudent use of money, with the cost being spread over a lengthy period, was refused to local government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we were discussing that subject it might be interesting, but we are not. We are talking about items which in the private sector are seen clearly as current expenditure and those which in recent years have been used by local authorities and called capital expenditure. My difficulty is that the accounting in the public sector has been different from what the private sector, or any other, has practised. I will be frank with the hon. Member for Brightside. If it had not been for the activities of some local authorities, which used all sorts of techniques to avoid what everyone knew was the truth, we would not be in this mess. That is my worry. The hon. Gentleman cannot cast the issue aside—he did so most elegantly, and he is known for his elegance—by saying that we are not talking of parking meters and leasing, selling off and leasing back town halls. Who talked of parking meters and town halls? Who ran those wholly unacceptable activities? It was his friends in the town halls that his party controlled who misused the principles of reasonable accounting. His hon. Friends have said how terrible it is that all that is to end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Haringey council has held a meeting to fix its rate. I hope that Opposition Members read a transcript of the meeting. They have said how terrible it is that the cost of the all the creative accounting of the past must now be paid. According to the hon. Member for Brightside, the Government, including the Minister for Local Government, are responsible for the fact that the debts must now be met. In future, we shall not tempt those local authorities. There will be no temptation to do what no one in private enterprise would have dreamt of doing in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the issue. Do we have public accountability in which public accounts are seen to be what private accounts must be? Do we have a real distinction between capital and current spending? Or, do we have a special kind of local authority account under which it is possible to capitalise something that would not be capitalised anywhere else? I give way to the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Local authorities have been put in this position by the Government. I shall give two examples. In 1978–79 to 1986–87, Exchequer subsidies to local authorities decreased from £1,258 million to £496 million. Housing investment allocations to English authorities fell in the same period from £525,266 million to £1,127 million. Bearing in mind inflation, what is the real value of the capital expenditure that local authorities lost in that period? Let us consider my local authority. In 1978 under the old allocation it received about £2 million; now it receives about £1.5 million HIP allocation. Taking account of inflation, it has lost millions of pounds in capital allocation. That is why it has been forced into creative accounting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) that the Labour party cut capital allocation by 45 per cent. in one year. I do not know how he dares to mention the figures. The hon.

That is what happened with the Labour Government, who ran into such desperate disaster that they lost the election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

made those reductions. Nor is it embarrassing when one thinks about all the riches, beyond the dreams of avarice, that were made available to the Conservative Government, not the Labour Government, from North Sea oil. The British Government of that time faced an unparalleled economic crisis. This Government have had all the money in the world at their disposal, but they have squandered it. That is the difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is apologising for a board of directors who, having taken over an efficient company which is making a profit, drive it into the ground by their incompetence and folly, and then say, "We had great difficulty because the company was going bankrupt." Of course it was. Under the management of Messrs. Healey and Wilson any organisation would go bankrupt, and that is what happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the brokers called in their bills the Labour Government did not cut current expenditure, which is the issue in question. Nevertheless, let us pretend that the crisis was not their fault and say that the problem was caused by the oil crisis and the international situation. A sensible Government would have cut current spending and said, "It may be embarrassing to our electorate, the Left-wing loonies may shout against us and there may be marches in the streets, but we will cut our housekeeping and save it for spending on the future. We shall spend less on our daily wants and invest in the future." That Government maintained spending on the present, hoping to get votes, and cut spending on the future by 45 per cent. in real terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have no right to criticise this Government. The present Government pay their debts. They make Britain a lender to other countries. They have made the British economy one of the strongest in the world. When people overdo current spending, the Government purposely increase interest rates because we must live within our means.

Opposition Members do not like our policy because the contrast between the two Governments is clear.

The idea is to define proper practices in the arrangements between capital and current expenditure so that local authorities do what most prudent people do. It will no longer be possible to mask current expenditure by pretending that it is capital expenditure, nor will councils fail to get help with capital expenditure because an item defined as non-capital in the past does not qualify. We are trying to ensure that local authorities' accounts are properly presented and that local authorities use the terms "capital expenditure" and "current expenditure" appropriately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue to which the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) refers is not a matter for debate under the clause. His question is: how much will the allocation for capital expenditure be? I have no doubt that however generous the Government are, he will suggest that the allocation should be bigger. He and I can argue about whether the expenditure is sufficient at the proper time. He should not argue about the definition of capital expenditure. We are attempting to ensure that we define as capital that which is capital, so I hope that the Committee will reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to the Minister, but his arguments were inaccurate and incorrect. I am an ex-councillor, an ex-chairman of finance and an ex-leader of a council. My council was in an invidious position on capital expenditure as a result of the amount of money that we lost over the years because of persistent Government cuts in capital expenditure. The law on capital expenditure changed with such frequency that we could not plan from year to year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regardless of what the Minister said, there is a housing shortage. Council houses are in disrepair. The statistics were not produced by the Labour party; they are Government statistics. The Audit Commission and any other commission that has examined the problem of housing capital has produced such statistics. My local authority must carry out approximately £66 million of repairs to its council houses, but it does not have the capital allocation to do so. As the Minister said, it must use creative accountancy to obtain capital to carry out those repairs and has often used capital receipts to carry out capital repairs. It did not want to do that, but is has been put into a position by the Government in which it has had to do so. Otherwise, houses would have fallen down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the Government want housing associations to take a larger share of public housing. I am happy for housing associations to take a leading role, but they are not spread widely and evenly throughout the country and they do not want the responsibility of wholesale council housing. They say that to anyone who is prepared to speak to them—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All of them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, I cannot answer that. But the majority of the housing associations to which I have spoken say that they do not want overall control of public housing. They wish to be involved, but not completely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The local authority of which I was a member has a close relationship with housing associations and was involved in joint schemes with at least three associations. During the past six months the authority gave land to North housing. Old people's flat and bungalows were built on a particular site and the local authority got nomination rights as part of the deal. Durham city council has had a good relationship with North housing, Three Rivers, Anchor housing, Hanover housing and Church housing. Housing associations play an important part in public housing, but local authorities play an even bigger part because they have 10,000 or more properties. Local housing associations do not have anywhere near that number.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the hon. Gentleman not build on that so that there are even more and tenants in his area have a real choice and are not stuck with the authority? Would it not be much better if the half a dozen housing associations that he has referred to increased their housing? Why not go for that instead of complaining about the lack of extra money for his own interest? He has 10,000 units; why not build up the others?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Housing associations do not have the capital needed to build new homes, nor do local authorities. I have already explained that within those 10,000 local authority houses there is a need for £66 million of repairs. People are living without central heating, in houses where the roofs leak, or in houses that are not structurally safe. Yet the Government have cut back time and again on capital expenditure that could have solved the problem. Durham has little land available, so no extra land is available for housing associations. We have not only to build new homes, but also to maintain and repair those we already have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not wish to speak about that, but the Minister brought the subject up in an earlier debate. I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 264, 267 and 268. Under the Local Government Planning and Land Act 1980 a local authority, including the direct labour organisation, is regarded as a single entity for the purpose of capital expenditure control. Because the DLO is legally seen merely as a department or arm of the local authority, its capital expenditure is included and is subject to the same controls as the parent authority, counting towards the authority's allocation for prescribed capital expenditure. The Government's philosophy about in-house DLOs is that they should be treated like commercial organisations, competing in the market place for contracts. A change is now overdue in capital allocations to take account of the competitive environment under the 1988 Act. The Government should be tackling that point in establishing a new capital expenditure control system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three years ago, in February 1986, the Department of the Environment published a consultation paper entitled, "Review of the local authority capital expenditure control system in England and Wales". The paper considered in detail the position of DLOs, indicating that the government were prepared to deal with the anomalous situation of DLOs' capital expenditure. I have an extract from that document. I shall not read it all, but Ministers should be reminded of a few relevant points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Division bell rang, I was speaking about the Department of the Environment consultation paper entitled, "Review of the local authority capital expenditure control system in England and Wales". The paper considered in detail
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>626</span>
the position of DLOs. The Government said in the paper that they were prepared to deal with some of the anomalies involving capital expenditure and to consider the matter sympathetically in future legislation on capital controls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 40 of the paper says:
	<br><q><p>"Local authorities have encountered some administrative difficulties over the treatment of direct labour organisations (DLO's) under the present capital control system."</p></q>
It goes on to say:
	<br><q><p>"The result is that authorities with DLOs have to maintain two separate records of their expenditure if they want to avoid scoring the full DLO charge unnecessarily as prescribed expenditure."</p></q>
Paragraph 41 states:
	<br><q><p>"The Government has offered to consider removing this anomaly in any new legislation on capital controls … Payments by the DLO would not then be prescribed expenditure. This would put DLOs on all fours with outside contractors, whose asset renewals and profits both have to be covered by their charge to the customer, which in the case of a local authority scores in full as prescribed expenditure. The Government is prepared to make this change if it is favoured by local goverment."</p></q>
It is favoured by local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part IV is horribly complicated and may contain a provision to cover my point, but I cannot find it. Unless something is done along the lines suggested by the amendments, DLOs will continue to be regarded as part of their local authority for capital expenditure purposes. That will severely limit the ability of DLO managers to run their organisations on commercial principles. They will not be able to operate on an equal footing with firms in the private sector against which they are required to compete, because they will be constrained by bureaucratic requirements which even Ministers must admit are out of place in the commercial world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In deciding what capital expenditure to incur, the DLO manager should be able to have regard purely to operational and commercial considerations, bearing in mind the requirement to achieve the statutory rate of return. He should not be hampered by the need constantly to ensure that his capital expenditure proposals can be contained within the credit limit applicable to the authority as a whole. The amendments seek to give effect to what the Government offered to do in paragraph 41 of the consultation paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new system of capital controls will hinder rather than help joint public and private schemes, which the Minister seemed to advocate. There have been imaginative schemes involving sale and rental, but the new controls will hamper further schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is the Minister so dogmatic? I ask him sincerely to come to Durham to see what we have done with the limited resources available to us and to see the problems that we have. Regardless of whether the landlord is a housing association or a local council, if the capital is not available, we cannot carry out the necessary repairs and improvements. If the amendments are not accepted, it will be more difficult for local authorities to fulfil their functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secretly, the Minister may not want local authorities to carry out their functions, but that is a different argument. Local housing authorites cannot carry out their function because of the lack of capital
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0766">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

available to them. If the Minister wants to see an efficient local authority working under extremely difficult conditions, he should come to Durham and I should be pleased to show him round. I am sure that he would be impressed and perhaps he would be a little more sympathatic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister decides whether to accept my hon. Friend's invitation to visit Durham, I hope that he remembers that he is on record as saying that he will visit Newham. It is not only the Minister's company but his education that we seek. He will learn a great deal if he takes up some of the invitations extended so generously and sincerely to him by Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the Minister had, as it were, flagellated himself with his own tongue, he sat down. He did not answer any of the points that we raised. That is what got me. He made great play of his industrial experience and I have taken time to study how extensive it is, as I would be more impressed by his arguments if I knew where he was coming from, as they say. His experience seems mostly to be in publishing with Selwyn Shandwick International Ltd, religious films. I have yet to discover whether it produces the sort of naughty nun film or even whether it offers a great deal of experience of private enterprise. Perhaps the Minister could tell me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> The hon. Gentleman may be glad to know that my experience was largely in the pre-Maxwell days of the British Printing and Communication Corporation—a not inconsiderable business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has some passing knowledge of the print industry. I still feel that that does not give him the right to lecture local authorities, which are substantial businesses in their own right, about their accounting practices. My hon. Friends have pointed out that many, nearly all, of the financial problems that have beset local authorities have been caused by the Government continually changing the rules on local authority finance. The job of local authority treasurer is impossible nowadays, because the rules change so often.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have, therefore, some specific questions for the Minister on this part of the Bill, which raises some serious questions of definition. The word "enhancement" appears in clause 31 as a permitted category of capital expenditure. Enhancement will be capital expenditure only if it lengthens "substantially" the useful life of the property. What, therefore, does "substantially" mean? Can it be defined? Local authorities will have to face such problems. For example, would roof renewal count as capital repairs in that it substantially lengthens the useful life of a property? I assume that it would. But would roof repairs qualify?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the questions that housing departments will have to ask themselves. Similar questions could be asked about new windows or rewiring. Where is the definition here? Is the Minister saying that "substantially" means what he says it means—in terms of extending the useful life of a property? This
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>628</span>
is not simply a matter of academic interest or of semantics. It will be crucial, because if repairs fall outside the definitions in this clause, they will have to be funded from the ring-fence housing revenue account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 31(3) says that enhancement should not be regarded as capital expenditure unless
	<br><q><p>"it should be so regarded in accordance with proper practices."</p></q>
That is another vague term. What do the words "proper practices" mean? Do they mean precisely what the Minister says they mean? I notice that, in clause 55, "proper practices" are defined as accountancy practices that are laid down in law, or regarded as proper by reference to any "published code or otherwise". What is meant by the term "or otherwise"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has complained, as have many Conservative Members, about the accountancy practices of local authorities. It is incumbent on the Government to draw the rules and wording of the Bill a little tighter. We must know precisely what we are talking about, as decisions will have to be made. Under subsection (5), the Secretary of State has the power to make regulations to specify types of expenditure as revenue or capital regardless of the general definitions. Under subsection (6), he may allow any specific expenditure incurred by a local authority to count as capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a further example of the Government taking extremely broad powers without any limitation whatever. I hope that the Minister and some of his less somnambulant hon. Friends will consider such matters. The Government said that they do not wish to stop capitalised repairs. What does that mean? We are trying through our amendments to make the Bill more specific.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government said that the power granted to the Secretary of State in subsection (6) deals with major natural disasters. We have had plenty of those and, in the past 10 years, we have had some fairly unnatural ones, too. Therefore, I suppose that it is necessary to write into the Bill some sort of provision to deal with disasters. Will the Minister give us more details about clause 31(6)? The definition of the word "enhancement" is crucial to the Bill. Under the legislation, the Secretary of State's powers to define whether expenditure is capital seem to be entirely unlimited, both specifically and generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The London borough of Newham has a capitalised planned maintenance programme based on survey, repair or renewal as necessary. My colleagues and I in Newham wish to know whether we can continue to capitalise that programme. If not, how are we supposed to fund it? Such questions must be answered by the officers who draw up reports for the approval of members of the council. I should be grateful to the Minister if he would consider those matters instead of lashing himself with his own verbosity. Will he direct his attention to the more specific, albeit prosaic, parts of the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) did me the great honour of reminding me of the comment about the ferret in

"Parliamentary Profile". He then suggested that one's brains were kept in that part of the body first reached by a ferret up one's trousers. I do not know where the hon. Gentleman keeps his brains, but some vital parts of the body are reached earlier by a ferret in its peregrinations than the part to which he referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only reason why the hon. Gentleman asked any of his latter questions must have been because he has never had a discussion with an accountant about how to run a business. Any of us who has ever run a business, be it small or large, knows that there are generally acceptable accounting practices. If a person does not obey those practices, his accounts will not be signed, but qualified. The Bill proposes that those genreally accepted accounting practices will apply. The hon. Gentleman has betrayed the problem. He ran the GLC, at least in part, not understanding the normal accounting practices that everyone else had to understand. He has shown that by his questions. Others know that a substantial repair is a repair that an accountant will accept that in a substantial and reasonable way will extend the life of the property. If it is merely putting back three slates on a roof, it cannot be capitalised, but if whole areas must be re-roofed, the accountant will agree that the accounts can be passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman goes on about how there must be a proper comparison with private business, but every private business has operated on those terms for years. The issue is why local authorities are not subject to the same reasonable rules of English as other people. The difference between capital and current is not always clearly describable in advance. A clause cannot be drafted to cover every conceivable situation. But up and down the country, business after business, large and small, effective and ineffective, profitable and unprofitable, has lived with the concept for many years. Local authorities should live with the same concept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister chose the bad example of three loose slates. I am beginning to think that three of his slates are loose. To use a building analogy, he points it up, because if three slates are missing at a crucial place in the slope of the roof where the rain pours through, and are not repaired quickly, there will be no substantial life left in the building. It is a matter of definition. The Bill is vague and the Minister has eloquently demonstrated just how vague.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has shown that the slates are lacking on the Opposition side of the House. The hon. Gentleman is talking about the ship that foundered for the lack of a nail. He is saying that whatever is done may have a capital effect and that, for example, if people do not redecorate properly, they may not notice that the rising damp has started to rise. The hon. Gentleman must know from experience in his house that often a dispiriting fundamental fault, such as the joists needing to be replaced, is discovered when he is hoping to do a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>630</span>
nice, cheap, clearing-up job. There is a view in building that any job contributes to prolonging the life of a property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Private industry and business have managed to tackle those problems for many years. Public local authorities also managed to deal with them for many years and that is why the term "proper practice" is used in the Bill. The hon. Gentleman is always telling me to talk about all local authorities. Most local authorities know perfectly well what is proper practice because they have been conforming to it for a long time. Haringey and one or two other local authorities discovered that by pushing the line they could distort their accounts, and they have been brought to account. In those circumstances we have had to restate what most Labour and Conservative local authorities know well. No one living in the real world would ask the questions that the hon. Gentleman asked. They are questions that would be asked only by someone whose knowledge of public and private business accounts is theoretical rather than practical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Cannot the Minister see that a lack of capital makes local authorities try creative accountancy methods simply because they do not have adequate resources available? With respect to the Minister, it is not accurate to say that my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) is out on a limb. The majority of local authorities, certainly in north-east England and far away from south-east England, have the problem of deciding what are capitalised repairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Private firms do not have the same problem. They cannot be compared with local authorities. If a private firm has a problem with a leaking roof, the firm will mend that roof. It does not have to worry about its legal position or whether it is spending capital or revenue. It gets on and does the job. Local authorities cannot do that because they do not know whether they are dealing with capital or revenue. For goodness sake, we cannot compare local authorities with private firms because of the restrictions imposed by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But only 10 minutes ago the hon. Gentleman said that we ought to compare local authorities with private industry. The fact is that no private firm is in any doubt. If it is just putting a slate on the roof, it knows that that is not a capital repair, but current expenditure. The hon. Gentleman is wrong. To take local authorities in London, Wandsworth has found it perfectly possible, within its capital arrangements to find enough money to provide the services necessary for the people who live there. Lambeth, which is next door, has been so incompetently run that, although it is similar in area to Wandsworth, it not only has higher rates and has failed to collect rents, but it has failed to provide services anything like as good as those in Wandsworth. Lambeth cannot run the show properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

better than those of Wandsworth. No one believes that. It is the most amazing—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are much more comprehensive, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman can say that but nobody believes him. He represents Haringey so how he can talk about services is hard to believe. I challenge him to look at the figures. He says that local authorities have not had the money to spend. In 1983–84 they had £1,148 million for renovation; in 1984–85, £1,280 million; in 1985–86, £1,312 million; in 1986–87, £1,512 million; in 1987–88, £1,651 million and in 1988–89, £1,970 million, which is nearly double. What the hon. Gentleman says is not true and he must not mislead the Committee. Between 1983–84 and 1988–89 the amount of money spent by local authorities on public-sector renovation rose from £1,148 million to £1,970 million. That is an amazing increase during the period when the Labour party was in power and spending was slashed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is all very well for the Minister to obtain statistics from colleagues who do not exist on the top table and to quote them, but will he give further examples of how much of that money was given in HIP allocations and how much came from capital receipts belonging to local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Naturally, the hon. Gentleman would say that part of the capital receipts have been spent in this manner. What else does he think capital receipts should be spent on, other than the improvement of existing housing?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. Local authorities could have spent more capital receipts—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it were not for the Government stopping them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not know the rules. They are that capital receipts can be spent on renovation. The hon. Gentleman is wrong because 100 per cent. of capital receipts can be spent in this way. The hon. Gentleman must get his facts right before he shouts from a sedentary position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why those local authorities have not spent more is because many Labour authorities did not want the capital receipts. They are wildly in arrears with the right to buy. I have met Camden and several other local authorities. I looked at Haringey's figures; much more could have been done if only it had sold housing and used the money properly. The hon. Gentleman knows that those authorities have failed to sell because of their Socialist ideology.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The remark to which the Minister responded, made from a sedentary position by my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) related to his remarkable challenge. What else, the Minister asked, would local authorities be expected to do with capital receipts but spend the money on improvements? I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>632</span>
agree with him. They can spend 100 per cent. on improvements. Wandsworth has raised capital receipts from housing and has spent the money on improving other housing to make it attractive for selling. That has been part of its effective social engineering policy. But the Bill will prevent that. That is the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only a few days before Easter, the Minister challenged me and said that it was important to write off debt rather than spend on improvement. In the calmest, gentlest way, I ask him what he means. Does he mean what else would a local authority be expected to do other than spend its capital receipts on improving stock, including what might be called minor repairs but which have been possible as part of a wider improvement programme, and capitalising the spending? Or does the Minister believe that he is doing what the Bill suggests—that is, forcing local authorities to use 75 per cent. of their receipts to write off historic debt?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's argument with me is about the money available and not about the process by which capital and current expenditure is distinguished. When the figures for the new system are placed for the first year I shall be happy to argue with the hon. Gentleman about whether we are providing enough capital and current money. But the hon. Gentleman must not confuse his fears for the future with the distinction between capital and current spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is interesting from the hon. Gentleman's comment is that he has commended Wandsworth for what it has done. Lambeth, next door, has failed to do any of those things. As a result, the decent, honourable people of Lambeth live in conditions in which they need not have lived if their council had cared for them rather than for its Marxist policies. We all note something interesting: to improve the houses of the people is called social engineering. We now know something important: anything that improves the housing of people of whom one does not approve—that is, those who want to buy their own house—is social engineering. No wonder Sheffield built the worst council blocks of flats in Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot let the Minister get away with that. Not all the flats that Sheffield built are what I should have wanted or voted for, had I been able to choose, but they were at least liveable in, which is more than can be said for many flats, including those on the Richmond estate in Wandsworth. It is proposed to spend money on them—money raised from council house sales—to sell flats which overlook park area. Those flats are currently occupied by tenants of every possible description and income, but in future they will be available only to those who can afford the £200,000 and £300,000 tag that will be put on them when they have been gentrified. That is what I was referring to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

carry out improvement to housing within the Government's guidelines. It has improved its housing and the lot of the people who live there, whereas Lambeth has not done so—at a much higher cost to its ratepayers. Poor or rich, there is no question about which borough people would prefer to live in. However poor one is, it is much better to live in Wandsworth, where services are provided and delivered, than in Lambeth, where they are neither provided nor delivered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to an increase for renovation in Lambeth from £1.1 billion to £1.9 billion between 1983–84 and 1988–89. Will he please give us the equivalent figures for Wandsworth?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misunderstood me. I was dealing with the national figures. Surely he does not suggest that £1 billion a year has been spent in Lambeth. At that time the hon. Gentleman was running Haringey. If his understanding of figures is so bad, perhaps that is why Haringey is in such a mess. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] It is no use the hon. Gentleman saying that that is what I said. The rest of the Committee knows perfectly well what I said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I did not hear the Minister correctly, will he tell us the figures for Lambeth and the equivalent figures for Wandsworth?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give the hon. Gentleman the figures for every London borough if he wants them. I cannot do so now because I am dealing with the national picture, which hon. Members on both sides of the House have asked me to do. I quoted the national figures because the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) rightly referred to the national situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposals are merely aimed at ensuring that local authorities' accounting practices are comparable with those acceptable in the world at large, which is a perfectly reasonable objective. We should not argue on that issue. On a different Bill the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant) and I can correctly argue about how much capital allocations should be and how much money should be provided through the rate support grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of the quantum and at this stage there is the argument about how to define it. I am saying only that the definition should be known to the world at large. It should not be a special sleight of hand which is applicable only to local authorities. It is proper to treat direct labour organisations as part of the local authorities to which they belong, not as independent bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot give the figures for Lambeth's capital spending because the authority has not submitted its return. I can give them for Wandsworth, which is a sensible authority that submits its returns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously the Minister has sat down, but has he finished his wander round the London boroughs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>634</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The definitions in the Bill are not those that private industry confronts in its accounting practices, as the Minister knows. I have enough experience in local government to realise how financial and accountancy rules were changed and backdated to make perfectly proper and legal arrangements in which some local authorities were involved retrospectively illegal. Those are the problems that local authorities have to cope with. The Minister knows that no private enterprise company has to deal with someone sitting on its back, changing the rules at will and making them retrospective so that it is impossible to say that there is a set form of rules on accounting practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill pursues that same road by giving a Secretary of State enormous powers of discretion to determine what the proper accountancy rules will be. That is the difference between local authorities and private industry, and why local authorities are in such terrible difficulty when they deal with the Government's legislation. It is too vague.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If so, it is perfectly reaonsable for us to argue about how the Government treat local authorities. The argument should not be about redefining capital expenditure in a way that is applicable only to local authorities.

Clause 33 specifies the items of expenditure that a local authority does not have to charge to a revenue account. It also permits it to charge such items to a revenue account if it so wishes and if it is consistent with proper accounting practices to do so. For example, it may be appropriate to charge some payments from a superannuation fund to a revenue account. As the clause stands, it would have to charge such an item of expenditure to a revenue account for the year in which it was incurred. Amendment No. 177 would permit it to charge it to a different year, but it will be able to do so only if it accords with proper accounting practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments would permit us to amend the list, including those made by the introduction of regulations. The list of expenditure in the clause is consistent with current accounting practices. Such practices might change. At the moment the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy is consulting about a new code for capital accounting. We do not envisage that, if implemented, the code would lead to a need to change clause 33. As we know, accounting is always a fluid art. It is prudent to be able to amend expenditure which does not have to be charged to a revenue account to reflect future changes in accounting practices.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments are consequential upon one of the measures in the recent Budget. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that Bank of England supervision of the queue of new issues is to be discontinued. These amendments would remove the requirement for a local authority to obtain the consent of the Bank of England before issuing marketable bonds or stocks, thus doing for local authorities what my right hon. Friend has done for private enterprise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For those of us who are somewhat untutored in the ways of the Bank of England—I include the Chancellor of the Exchequer—will the Minister explain in lay person's terms exactly what the amendment means?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to do so. In the past, when people came forward with a new issue, it was felt to be unsatisfactory if two large issues appeared on the same day. Therefore, a kind of queuing arrangement arose. But because of the City of London's remarkable success in earning money for the economy, and the way in which it has become the world markets centre, it is no longer an embarrassment to the City of London if large issues follow each other or if there are two on the same day. It was felt that it was better to get rid of that queue and allow the market to make its own decisions. What we want—I hope the hon. Gentleman will support us—is to allow local authorities to take their proper part in such activities and not be forced to queue when private enterprise no longer needs to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been looking at part IV of the Bill, which deals with expenditure and other matters, including the financial arrangements for local authorities. We are now considering the borrowing powers of local authorities, and one can readily see that again we are analysing the centralisation of local government activities, which are being annexed to central Government by the grant of further powers to the Secretary of State and Marsham street over local authorities' borrowing powers.

Clause 34 (1) begins:
	<br><q><p>"Subject to the following provisions",</p></q>
and subsection (2) states:
	<br><q><p>"Except with the approval of the Secretary of State."</p></q>
Further reference to additional restrictions on borrowings is found in subsection (3), which stipulates:
	<br><q><p>"without the consent of the Treasury".</p></q>
The Secretary of State and the Department of the Environment will have tremendous control over the raising of money by local authorities and the borrowing powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We tabled another amendment to provide a better interpretation of "loan instrument", but it was not selected. It is important to have a better explanation of "loan instrument".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendments Nos. 180 and 181 would change the provision, but no reference is made to the change in the explanatory notes on clauses. The change is important because those two amendments would make all local authority borrowing subject to clauses 34 to 38. The Building Employers Confederation has expressed anxiety about housing finance. The Secretary of State will restrict even further the availability of money to local authorities to carry out repairs and maintenance. That was made clear in the previous clause, but under clause 34 there will be further restrictions on local authorities' ability to maintain housing, including sheltered accommodation for old people. Before any borrowing takes place, reference must be made to the Department of the Environment and the Secretary of State, and in many instances to the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment proposes that when private and local Acts exist to enable local authorities to borrow money, they should be retained. Perhaps the Minister will explain why powers that have been approved are no longer necessary to help local authorities raise money. Our amendment would allow those powers to be retained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 34(7) provides that when local authorities have powers under private or local Acts to borrow money, the powers
	<br><q><p>"shall cease to have effect for financial years beginning on or after 1st April 1990."</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>638</span>
If the clause is enacted, local powers and previous Acts that have benefited local authorities will cease after 1 April 1990. Will the Minister tell the Committee why it is necessary to rescind such powers? Why will private and local Acts cease to have effect after 1 April 1990? What private and local Acts will cease to be effective after that date? How will the borrowing powers be replaced under the new system?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The City of Westminster has been cited as the model authority on more than one occasion by the Minister for Local Government. In a letter, the city treasurer expressed his concern that the powers contained in the Greater London Council (General Powers) Act 1967, under which the city council borrows by way of Revenue bills, will be taken away from local government by the Bill. The treasurer points out that section 35 of the Greater London Council (General Powers) Act 1969 enables London borough councils to ask the Treasury to appoint a lead borough to borrow on their behalf. Why is the Minister taking powers to abolish previous legislation? I asked him what will replace those Acts, because local authorities will face grave difficulties if further provisions are not made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A preview of the Government's intentions was provided by the Minister responsible for inner cities when he visited Bradford on 16 March and made a further contribution in the form of grant, so that the urban aid programme could be announced and the local authority would have to borrow less. The extra grant to Bradford was £4.5 million and may have been made to save the authority from the embarrassment of having to apply to the Minister for further borrowing powers to meet its commitments. Drastic measures were taken by the Bradford local authority, which cut its contribution to local charitable organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that Bradford had a preview of the intention behind the Bill and that the extra grant was meant to help the local authority with the extra borrowing that would be necessary. The headline in the 	<i>Yorkshire Post</i> at the time was "Grant 'corruption'" and one can readily see now where corruption comes in. If subsection (7) is allowed to remain in the Bill, it will be clear that the grant was made to Bradford to ensure that it would not have the same problems as other local authorities, which will have to extend a request to the Secretary of State for further borrowing powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (7) should be deleted, as the amendment proposes, so that the existing borrowing powers and private arrangements will be allowed to continue. In view of the demands made on local government services, it is necessary for local authorities to retain their borrowing powers. Subsection (7) would cripple local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have great sympathy with the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien). I rather liked the old borrowing powers, and would have wished to keep them.

I studied this part of the Bill because I wanted to bone up on the type of questions that the hon.

Member for Newham, North-West might ask me. I suspected that he would ask for detail on how this part of the Bill would operate, although he actually asked his questions on the previous amendment. The more I looked at the Bill, the more I asked myself why we could not keep the old powers. I rather liked their names and fact that they are themselves interesting powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Haringey, for example, has powers under the Explosives Act 1875 to borrow for the purpose of building magazines. I doubt whether the London borough of Haringey would nowadays wish to borrow to build a series of magazines to protect itself against the populace or the populace against itself. I then discovered that the powers do not do Haringey any good because even if it wanted to borrow under that Act the amount of borrowing that it could undertake under its general powers would be reduced by the amount that it borrowed under its specific powers. Since 1933, the special powers have not been worth much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Opposition Members can find me examples, outside the City of London, of people borrowing under their special powers when they could not borrow under any other powers, I would be glad to hear of them. The City of London used the City of London Sewers Act 1897 on one occasion, to borrow in a particular way, but I do not know of any other examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers given here cover all the circumstances that are covered by particular borrowing powers. The narrow borrowing powers are just as much subject to the Treasury and the Secretary of State for the Environment because none cover the whole of the borrowing of any local authority and so any use of them is taken into account in the rest of the borrowing which is allowed with the agreement of the Secretary of State and the Treasury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister assuring us that the Greater London Council (General Powers) Act 1967 will not be changed by the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One effect of that general powers Act will be changed. Under that Act, Haringey can borrow in the name of Westminster because it is the lead borough. In future it will have to borrow in its own name. That change is advantageous both to Westminster and to the public as a whole. I do not see why Westminster—or, for example Hammersmith and Fulham—should act as a kind of cover, and its credit be used to borrow on behalf of, let us say at random, Camden. That is unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers to borrow that are given in the Bill cover all authorities and subsume the powers to borrow in the individual Acts. It will no longer be possible for a London borough to borrow in the name of some other borough. I cannot imagine any circumstances in which that would be a disadvantage, except those in which it ought not to operate. The use of the 1967 Act is already being terminated by the Treasury, whose consent is required for its use anyway. That is reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were a proud citizen of Haringey, I would want to incur my debts on my own behalf. I would not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>640</span>
wish them to be hidden under the name of Westminster, which has been attacked so strongly by Opposition Members. I should not wish to trade on its name, and I am sure that hon. Gentlemen would not wish me to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is saying that, with the Treasury's consent, powers will be granted to individual boroughs. As the Government believe in market forces and in the marketplace as the means of obtaining the best possible deal, is the right hon. Gentleman saying that local authorities will have the opportunity under the Bill to enter the finance market to borrow money to finance their projects?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, if the hon. Gentleman is saying that local authorities are on equal terms with private individuals, so they should be able to borrow like private individuals—but that would mean that they can go bust, too. If they do not pay their bills, they must be able to go bankrupt. The hon. Gentleman has never proposed that local authorities should be subject to that half of the argument. He wants local authorities to have all the advantages of entrepreneurial capital, but none of the disadvantages. He does not want local authorities to be able to go bust. He wants them to be able to borrow money knowing that someone else will pay the bill, however incompetent the authorities are and however unsuitable lending was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as I am aware, members of my local authority are not in danger of being surcharged. Is the Minister aware that the equivalent to going bust in local government is that councillors face surcharges if they act improperly? I am not arguing against that action, but such a penalty for their acting with financial impropriety is equivalent to their going bankrupt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the equivalent to bankruptcy, but to the position in which a director is personally liable for acting improperly as a director. That is different from a business going bust. A company can face bankruptcy even if the director did not behave improperly, but simply failed to run the business well. A local authority cannot go bust. Lending money to a local authority is different from lending money to a joint stock company. A person stands a much greater chance of losing his money if he lends it to an organisation that can go bust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Member for Normanton that, under the bill, local authorities can choose whether to borrow the amount they are permitted to borrow from the market, or whether to borrow it from the Public Works Loans Board. The Government are not debarring local authorities from borrowing money from the market. We are saying that there will be a limit to the amount of money that they can borrow. That is a reasonable provision because the normal limits of the market are not available to local authorities, which have the power to raise money and the inability to go bust, unlike local businesses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The record will show that the Minister's first comments were misleading. At the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>641</span>
outset, he said that it would be wrong for local authorities to borrow money from the market like individuals, because they do not have the same problems, yet he is saying now that local authorities can go to the market. Within a few seconds, the Minister changed his mind. If it is right for central government to raise money for projects in the free market, why are local authorities prevented from doing the same? After all, the Government cannot go bankrupt, and nor can the Prime Minister or Ministers be surcharged. Why is it right for the public sector in the form of central government to have the privilege of entering the free market, when the public sector in the form of local government is denied it? Will the Minister explain the reason for that difference?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Government over-borrow when they borrow public money, the effect is felt immediately on the country's general economy and the public will know that that is the Government's fault.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the Government's jobs is to keep the economy on the right course, so they must control both their own spending and that of local authorities. It would be quite wrong if the Government did not control what amounts to a quarter of public sector spending. Not only this Government but Labour Governments have kept such spending under control, and there have been no arguments on the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton says that I have changed my tack, but I have not. First, I was answering his question which was, as I understood it, whether, under our proposals, local authorities could borrow money willy-nilly as local firms do. The answer is no. There are limits on how much authorities can borrow, but they can borrow from the market rather than from the Public Works Loans Board if they wish. There are limits because local authorities are not subject to the natural discipline of the market—the danger of going bust.

The hon. Member for Normanton made several not altogether complimentary remarks about Bradford. I was surprised. I thought that, as an honourable man, he would like to watch Bradford at work and to see whether its ideas will be successful. I hope that he will do so. I trust that you, Mr. Hunt, will allow me to say that Bradford has no bearing on the amendment because it has no local Act borrowing powers and cannot exercise any of the powers that the hon. Member for Normanton wishes us to preserve in the clause.

There is no reason to continue local borrowing arrangements, which do not provide greater facilities. We should keep the general power and get rid of the subsidiary powers, including that which allows Haringey to borrow to build magazines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>The Committee proceeded to a Division.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) is already taking part in a Division in Room 12. How does that affect his position in this Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am responsible only for what happens in this Room. I see no way out of that particular dilemma.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hunt.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The doors are kept open at the Chairman's discretion, but there is a limit to the Chairman's discretion.
