	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed</i> [this day]: No. 38, in page 4, leave out lines 7 and 8.—	<i>[Mr. George Howarth.]</i></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. David Trippier)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. Have you any information to give the Committee about prospective moves from this less-than-desirable accommodation to more salubrious surroundings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have good news for the Committee. Our persistence has paid off. As from Thursday, we shall meet in Room 10, which is a much more spacious Room. That applies to morning sittings. Unfortunately, because Room 10 is always used for other purposes on Thursday afternoons, we shall have to transfer to Room 9 for the afternoon sittings. Generally speaking, with the exception of Thursday afternoons sittings, we shall, we hope, be in Room 10 from now onwards as it has been vacated by the Water Bill Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. I am grateful for your efforts. I should like to put it on the record that I have appalling memories of Committee Room 10, having been a member of the Standing Committee of the Local Government Finance Bill in 1987. I contracted terrible infections there. I hope that this is not some dreadful move to put me out of action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall arrange for the necessary spraying to be undertaken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Knowsley, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was taking an intervention from the Under-Secretary just before we adjourned this morning, but I cannot recall what it amounted to. If the hon. Gentleman would like to intervene again and refresh my memory, I shall give way. Otherwise, I think that I have said enough on the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for allowing me to intervene. I was making a number of points about Camden and he went on to tell the Committee that I was now a big boy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made his point more effectively than I could.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made a number of points this morning in support of the clause. One related to the behaviour of Camden council, and its press officer in particular, whom the Minister described as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>180</span>
being biased in the way he carried out his duties, on the basis of a meeting between the Minister and the council. Will the Minister tell us the aim of the clause? Is it to prevent bias in th performance of duties by local government officers? If so, it will not have that effect. All the Bill does is provide that these officers do not lose their employment if they give biased advice and that they are not allowed to participate in public activity outside their role as local government officers. The same biased advice will continue to be given as before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister make it clear what the Government hope to achieve by pressing forward with the clause? Do they wish to wreak revenge on local government officers, whom they feel may be biased, by interfering with their civil liberties and preventing them from standing as councillors, EuroMembers or Members of Parliament? The Government cannot prevent them from performing their present roles. That is the crux of the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. John Selwyn Gummer)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not much easier, for example, for a press officer to give independent advice, especially when it involves a sharp press release of the type to which some people may take exception, if he does not have party political affiliations elsewhere? Surely even if he gives the most unbiased advice, it will be more difficult for it to be believed if he has those affiliations. That is the real issue. Is it not hard for people if they put themselves into that double position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I honestly think that the Minister is making a great mistake. It is not a question of it being easier for them to be seen to give independent advice if they do not hold a senior position in a party political organisation. The Bill allows such people to be members of party political organisations, to appear on literature that is produced by parties and to be clearly identified with them. The Bill prevents them only from holding office or an official position in a political party. How that changes the nature of advice that a local officer would give, or changes the way in which a local government officer would undertake his duties is beyond me. The same press officer will continue to do what he has always done. The Bill will make it impossible for him to hold a party political senior position or to speak or write publicly about a matter of political controversy other than that associated with the job. Press officers may be encouraged to sublimate all their political ideas into their job and to become party political in it, because the Bill prevents them from having any role outside the job of local government officer. The Minister does not appear to achieve anything with the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may recall that I said that the post in question was such a precise post that it would be a sensitive role for a press officer and that the person concerned should be politically impartial. I also mentioned that the Widdicombe report stated—the hon. Gentleman may not like it—that officers of the council at whatever level are serving the whole council, not only the controlling group. That point appears to be lost on the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that it would be advisable for the press officer to be seen to be impartial, the critical phrase is "seen to be", because his impartiality is not affected by whether or not the Bill becomes an Act. He is still the same impartial person. He is not affected by the fact that the Government propose to restrict his political
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0519">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>181</span>
activity outside his role as a local government officer. The Minister seems incapable of understanding that. The behaviour of the press officer in carrying out his duties will go on as usual. The only effect will be on the press officer's civil liberty to indulge in political activity outside his role as local government officer. He will not change his behaviour merely because he cannot stand as councillor in another council. He will continue to perform his role as he has always done. The Bill does not affect that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that press officers and others should be seen as officers of the whole council. Everyone accepts that. But there is nothing untoward in a council deciding that it is the duty of local government officers to implement a decision and, if they are press officers, to put it across in the press.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman honestly suggesting that the chief officer of Clydebank can be seen as chief officer of the whole council if, at the same time, he is a Labour councillor in Glasgow? How can he be seen as that even if he is the most honourable, decent person in the world? The people of Clydebank must associate his political views in Glasgow with his position as chief executive in Clydebank. How can he divide himself in that way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that I could make the Minister understand the simple situation. If the Bill is enacted, the chief executive will be faced with the decision whether to carry on his job as chief executive or resign as a district councillor in Glasgow. Who doubts that he will resign as a Glasgow district councillor rather than give up his employment as chief executive of Clydebank? How does that change the way in which a person does his job as chief executive? It changes only appearances. It may appear that he is not a member of the Labour party thereafter, but the reality is that he will remain a member and as chief executive of Clydebank council. Nothing has changed other than that the Government have wreaked revenge on him for being a member of the Labour party and have prevented him from participating in any sort of political activity outside his chief executive's post. The Bill is vindictive. It does not achieve anything by way of altering the advice or the performance of local government officers. The Minister fails to grasp that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What has changed is that there will not in future be a chief executive of Clydebank who is a councillor—Labour, Conservative, Liberal, National Front or Trotskyite—therefore, in future, the public will have a confidence that it does not now have. That is what has changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are in danger of widening the debate. The amendment refers to officers who communicate with journalists or broadcasters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hunt. Let us consider those officers who communicate with journalists or broadcasters. It is possible for any one of them to be a Trotskyite, a Labour or Conservative party member or a Democrat, and to continue to carry out the role of officer. The Bill does not prevent that. Any member of any political party, for example the Fascist party, could continue to be a press officer or any local government officer, if he so wished. What such a person could not do is be open and honest about that and stand for political
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>182</span>
office elsewhere. Apparently the Government do not like someone admitting to the public, "This is what I am in my private life" and carrying on with his job as a local government officer. The Government prefer everything to be kept under the table and not spoken about, as it used to be in Tory councils in Scotland many years ago, when all the chief officers were members of the Conservative party. Only when they had finished their prayers did they come out into the open to stand as regional or district councillors elsewhere and sometimes even in the same city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are trying to achieve a complete fraud through the Bill. It will not improve local government. The Government are merely wreaking revenge on those in local government whom they think are Labour party people. That will be the sole achievement of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cecil Franks 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barrow and Furness)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can get the hon. Gentleman away from politics for a minute and give him a clear parallel. Suppose that a chief constable or a judge were a member of a local authority in a political capacity. How would the hon. Gentleman feel about that? Does he accept that not only must justice be done, but that it must be seen to be done? That applies equally to chief executives and senior local authority officers, as to the police or the judiciary. I am sure the hon. Gentleman would agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that chief constables and judges are not allowed to stand for office in councils or anywhere else, but that does not change the reality that most chief constables are probably members of the freemasons and that most judges are probably supporters of the Conservative party. That is not fair, but it is reality. Nothing is altered by it. Just because people may not be open and honest about what they are, does not change them. They remain what they are—supporters of a political philosophy. That is my argument. The Bill will not depoliticise local government. Through its provisions, the Government will deliberately trample on the civil rights of local government officers who will remain political animals, like everyone else in society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government could propose any amendment on any provision in the Bill that would improve the performance of local government officers, they would receive the Opposition's support. But all the while they carry out a vindictive campaign against local government officers and deny them their civil liberties. We shall oppose them to the very end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Truro)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 13, in page 4, leave out lines 18 to 20.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to ascertain why the Minister thinks that chief fire officers are likely to have difficulty with political bias when advising people. Can the Minister give any examples?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would delete chief fire officers from the list of the statutory chief officers to whom the restriction on public political activity would apply. I accept that the hon. Gentleman tabled the amendment as a probing amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Fire Services Act 1947, the chief officer of a fire brigade must report directly to the local authority responsible for the brigade or to a committee of that authority. Therefore, there can be no question but that he is the authority's principal adviser on all matters directly affecting the fire brigade. As such, there is no possible
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0520">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>183</span>
reason why he should be permitted simultaneously to undertake public political activity. As head of the fire service in the authority, he is in exactly the same position as the director of education or of social services or the chief finance officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be argued that it is anomalous for the chief fire officer to be included, but for the chief constable, as head of another uniformed service, to be excluded. The answer to that is that the chief constable, unlike the chief fire officer, does not hold a post under the local authority. Like all constables, he holds an independent public office, so is subject to the provisions of the police regulations which prohibit political activity in terms more stringent than those proposed for local authority staff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly the Minister has no examples of abuse, but I am not entirely surprised. In my view, the role is a technical one. It is difficult to imagine a conflict of interest, unless the chief officer did not alert the fire brigade about a fire in the house of a Conservative councillor in a Labour-controlled authority—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the fire engines are red, as my hon. Friend says. I do not wish to press the matter further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 42, in page 4, line 41, leave out 'reports directly or is directly accountable to' and insert
	<br><q><p>'regularly deputises in respect of the whole range of duties for'.</p></q>
My colleagues on the Front Bench tabled the amendment because we must clarify the position of a deputy chief officer. The clause is extremely vague. Its clarity is seriously flawed. As drafted, it includes many departmental staff, in addition to appointed deputies. Subsection (6) is wildly imprecise. It defines "deputy chief officer" specifically for the purpose of paragraph (d) of subsection (1), which is part of the list of individually designated, politically restricted posts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A deputy chief officer is specifically caught by clause 2(1)(d) rather than included in the £13,500 mopping-up provision. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the definition in the subsection should bear some relation to what is usually understood by the term "departmental deputy" in local government. In a district authority, that would mean either a designated deputy or someone who regularly performs the duties of a chief officer. In a large authority such as a county council, a deputy would normally be someone whose job description includes responsibility for deputising for the whole range of a chief officer's functions. Third tier officers may sometimes act on behalf of the chief officer when he and the designated deputy are unavailable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is entirely appropriate for the clause to define "deputy chief officer", but the problem is getting the definition right. An officer who reports "directly to" or "is directly accountable to" a chief officer is not, by any definition, his deputy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many aspects of local government are specialised and require the appointed expert to report directly to a chief officer. But the appointee is not a deputy. Perhaps I may give some examples from Durham city council. The first is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>184</span>
the chief auditor and the city treasurer. The chief auditor is a fourth tier officer. The second is the town clerk and chief executive and the city solicitor and personnel officer; the former is a chief officer and the latter a third tier officer. The third example is the town clerk, a chief executive and the principal executive assistant, who is a third tier officer. Those examples are from a small authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the larger authority of Durham county council and its solicitors and secretaries department. As drafted, the clause would bring within the definition of deputy chief officer a substantial majority of that department's staff. Out of 50 employees, about 29—almost 60 per cent.—could be said to report directly, or to be directly accountable to the chief officer. Incidentally, that excludes the designated deputy and also the secretarial, typing and clerical staff, the latter being covered by subsection (7). A considerable proportion of that number would fall below the threshold in clause 2(1)(h). As paragraph (h) is presumably intended to be the catch-all provision, it is illogical for officers who are not caught to be caught by the more restrictive "deputy chief officer" definition. Moreover, the words "reports directly" refer to what happens in practice rather than to the duties of the post.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no qualification requiring such reporting to take place on a regular basis, and a similar phrase is used in clause 3. To take an extreme example, one isolated incident of a direct report could conceivably bring an officer within the clause. Surely, that cannot have been intended by the Government when the Bill was drafted?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the consequences of holding a politically restricted post are significant, it is impossible for officers to be clear about their positions. That is why we must get the legislation sorted out this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another provision in the Bill again highlights the wide nature of clause 2 and the inconsistent treatment of deputies. Clause 5(6) personally enables the monitoring officer to nominate a deputy to act in his absence; only that person can deputise for him for the purposes of clause 5. That is a narrow definition of a deputy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment does not purport to make the definition in clause 2(6) as narrow as that in clause 5(6). It attempts to bring the definition within workable and understandable limits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to confine the definition of deputy chief officers to those officers who deputise for their chief officers as part of their conditions of service. The real issue is the responsibility given to the post holder. The amendment will make clear who is the deputy to the chief officer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) may be pleasantly surprised to hear me say that I listened to him carefully and I found some of his arguments compelling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have drawn the definition from the Fire Services Act 1947 and have experienced no difficulty with its usage and application. However, I shall look carefully to see whether the hon. Gentleman's points can be met. If he will withdraw his amendment, we can return to it on Report if we wish to make a change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 2 refers to politically restricted posts and causes concern because it widens the principles suggested by the Widdicombe committee. The Widdicombe committee recommended that the legislation should be amended to include persons who are councillors, standing for council election, or who were councillors during the last year and who are not employed by another authority at the rank of principal officer or above.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Widdicombe committee principle is being widened by the Bill. We consider that clause 2 should not be accepted in its present form. That is why we tabled the amendments. I made it clear this morning that our amendments were constructive. They seek to ensure that local government officers are defended and that local government is given the opportunity to use its own code of practice for what the Government consider to be political activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The restrictions that are to be imposed on officers of local authorities mean that no one will have the right to hold office in a political party; people in the restricted category will be denied the opportunity to speak in either a public or a personal capacity and to engage in political debate. The Government are imposing that restriction upon local authority officers who are well below the rank proposed by the Widdicombe committee. The Government are also restricting those people from canvassing in local elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said this morning that a bill displayed in the window of a house could be the subject of an inquiry to find out who put it there. If it were a person in the restricted capacity defined by the Government, that person would be acting in contravention of the proposed legislation. In other words, the suggestions made in the clause are, in many instances, too ridiculous for words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's response to Widdicombe should therefore define the restricted group as chief officers or chief executives and their deputies. Decisions about posts below that level should be left to local authorities
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should not, without clarification, use the figures of £13,500 as remuneration to decide whether a person holds a politically restricted post. The Minister promised this morning to provide a legal definition of "remuneration" when we talked about bonuses, overtime and unsociable hours payments, but that issue must be taken into consideration and not included in the £13,500. If staff who are in or just below the £13,500 bracket receive annual increases, that should automatically increase the figure in the Bill. It would provide consistency in the figure to be used for politically restricted posts. The decision should not be left to the Secretary of State. I hope that the Minister will take our arguments into consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<b>The Chairman's</b> 	<i>attention having been called to the fact that ten Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room, and ten Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate your ruling on the quorum, Mr. Hunt. It arose because some of my colleagues are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>186</span>
serving on other Committees, and I suppose that the same is true of Conservative Members. There are so many Committees sitting that some Members have to serve on more than one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman suggests that the provision is an outrageous attack on civil liberties, but there is not one Opposition member present in Committee to hear his eloquent speech. Is the threat as serious as he says, or are all the other Committees on which his hon. Friends are serving more important? It is a scandal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We on this side of the Committee—	<i>[Laughter.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. The hon. Gentleman is misleading the Committee by saying, "We on this side of the Committee". Another hon. Gentleman has just come into the Room, but until then there was only the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We on this side of the Committee do not require the moral support that the Minister needs. We understand local government much better than he does, because of our experience. The physical backing that the Minister requires is unnecessary to the Opposition Front Bench.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One member of the Opposition Front Bench is equal to seven members of the Government Front Bench. The Minister's question shows his weakness in needing so much support. We believe that eight or nine Tories do not equal one good Labour man, and that is what we are showing in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the clause stand part debate, at no time should we allow the Secretary of State the power to decide when the figure of £13,500 should be increased or amended. He should not be left to decide whether people are to be restricted in their political activities in their communities. I gave several examples of how stupid the clause is in its present form. I repeat that the Secretary of State should not have those powers, and that the Bill should be more specific and categoric in explaining exactly what the Government mean by restricted posts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to withdraw clause 2 because of the difficulties that local government will encounter in promoting it and because it will restrict the civil liberties of local government officers. I am sure that no one in the Room wants that to happen, but if the clause stands the civil liberties of many local government officers will be restricted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important clause for the protection of the civil liberties of the majority of the population. In a society that expects perhaps greater independence from its civil servants and local government officers than do other societies, it is not proper that local government officers are treated entirely differently from civil servants. They were not in the past because by a self-denying ordinance local government officers took on themselves the restrictions imposed on civil servants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sadly, those times are past. We are trying to create between the two groups the relationship that most people believe exits. We are putting into law the arrangements which were once the practice and which are generally thought not only to be right but to still exist. Only as we have gone through the Bill have we discovered again and again from almost every Opposition speech—that is, when hon. Gentlemen are here—examples of twin-tracking. Our
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0522">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>187</span>
proceedings have brought to light all sorts of practices that people did not know about, and I hope that our sittings will continue to be so helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned with public civil liberties. For example, it would be odd to go to a principal officer for impartial advice, only to answer a bang on the door in the evening and find the same officer asking for a vote on behalf of a political party. That is an unsuitable practice. Most people feel that a responsible person would not let it happen, yet we have seen many examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have described the more extreme instances to show the limits to which the practice can go. How embarrassing it must be for people in Lliw valley to ask their chief executive for information in the morning and to find that as chairman of the local Labour party he knocks on their doors in the evening asking for subscriptions. The householder does not wish to be put in that position, nor does his authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that it is better that members of the public know their chief executive's political leanings, rather than him keeping them secret? He may create the impression of giving impartial advice, while all along his advice is not impartial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's proposition is wholly alien to the British constitution. It has never arisen with civil servants and it does not exist in local government. If an officer wishes to give independent and impartial advice, he must behave in a way that leads people to believe what he says. If an officer is chairman of the local Labour or Conservative party, people will not believe that his advice is independent, irrespective of what it is. That is no issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Squire 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hornchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish simply to bolster what my right hon. Friend says. Those of us who led local authorities for a number of years would not have dreamt of asking chief officers what their politics were. It would have been an unreasonable and unsound question. In virtually every case we had no knowledge of whether our chief officer was a Conservative, a Socialist or a member of any of the other varieties now on offer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, and I can give an example. Recently I spoke to the chief executive of the London borough of Croydon, which has a strong Conservative majority. I knew the officer in a previous existence as the chief executive of the London borough of Lewisham, which has a large Labour majority. The man did his job in both boroughs with utter responsibility and was respected as a man of real independence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The man achieved his standing because he did not take part in politics. I do not know his political view, although it is difficult to believe that someone with such an interest in local government does not have one. When he was chief executive of Lewisham, all the members of the council felt that he was theirs. Now that he is chief executive of Croydon, all the council members feel that he is their chief executive. If he were the chairman of the local Labour or Conservative party, the council could not think that he was the chief executive because it would be humanly impossible—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the Minister give the example of chief executive officers? If the Minister wrote into the Bill chief executive officers and their deputies, we should probably support him. But he is disfranchising 70,000 to 90,000 local government officers. How many chief
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>188</span>
executives or their deputies who are members of political parties are councillors in another local authority? They could not be counted on the fingers of one hand?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am thrilled to be able to adopt that assessment. Although the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) was not prepared to condemn a chief executive for being chariman of the Labour party, the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that it is in Scotland. I yield to no one in my respect for the Scots. The hon. Member for Dundee, East was not prepared to condemn the fact that the chief executive of a local authority was also a Labour member of a Glasgow council. His hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) would vote with the Government on that matter. I am pleased that we have discovered a division between Opposition members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is my custom to give two examples, one at the top of the scale and the other at the bottom. A very low-paid person could be responsible for the allocation of council housing, perhaps in a village. He would tread a difficult path anyway in balancing one priority against another. It is important that he should not have political affiliations because his decisions must be clearly seen to be on the basis of priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example of a village in my constituency—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Out of touch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that I am out of touch. I am talking about my constituency, with which I am in daily touch and in which I live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When decisions have to be taken and advice given to the authority about allocation, it is easier if the political affiliations of the person taking that decision are not known. He cannot then be accused of favouring someone who has a housing priority, even if they have the same political affiliations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my constituency, Gerrard Hatton—no relation to the unmentionable Derek Hatton—was the chairman of the Rossendale and Darwen constituency Labour party. He was a housing allocation officer on not too high a salary and a Labour county councillor. As my right hon. Friend the Minister said this morning, it is not what is going on, but the public perception of it that matters. How could the public trust that gentleman with housing allocations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The example is staggering. I considered people in Rossendale to have a solid and sensible northern attitude and I am amazed that it could happen there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The allocation of housing should not be left to one person. In my constituency, Leeds city council and Wakefield city council give me a list of housing priorities when I ask about housing allocation. I despair if, in a Tory-controlled authority in the Minister's constituency, housing allocation is left to one person. The political members of the authority should decide who is to be allocated housing. That is the crux of the matter. The Minister should look at the Tory authorities and leave those that are doing it correctly alone. Priorities for housing allocation are laid down in practically every Labour controlled authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>189</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot get away with that. Labour and Tory authorities have a list of priorities and make arrangements, which are laid down by the council. Someone then has to try to match the availability of houses with people on the housing list. He has to advise the council on who should receive houses. It is easier for an individual to give advice if he is seen to be impartial and independent than if he is known to be a Labour councillor and the chairman of the local Labour party. How could anyone believe that such a housing allocation officer was independent if he decided to give a house to a Labour party supporter? He may have decided honestly—I am sure that he would—but could anyone believe that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Irvine Patnick 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hallam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can we move from houses to buses? I refer to the case of the Rt. Hon. Albert Booth, a former Secretary of State for Employment, who was given a job by South Yorkshire county council as director of South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive with the statement, "He will be very helpful to us." How could I go to him for impartial advice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not suggest that the mark of being an hon. Member should stick for as long as the mark of Cain. I do not know why Labour Members find it so difficult to understand that ordinary people, wishing to believe that justice is done and seen to be done, may have nasty thoughts if the person deciding who should have which house or advising on the matter—the hon. Member for Normanton may shake his head, but local authorities, having laid down the rules, would be well advised to expect an independent officer to take the decisions. The hon. Gentleman should not shake his head. The officer must be seen to be independent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister gave the example of a housing officer in a local authority. The Minister considered that the electorate would have no confidence in an officer who was a member of a political party. I give an opposite example of a Labour county councillor in Durham who is a rent collector. I thought that a rent collector would be one of the most despised people it was possible to be, especially nowadays. That rent collector's majority is about 2,000. He polls more votes than all the other candidates put together. If he was so despised people would not vote for him, but they respect him. They know that he does his job as a rent collector and as a county councillor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final comment is about housing authorities. If the Minister is saying that his district council leaves the allocation of houses to its officers, what are the councillors doing? If that happened in Durham, the matter would go to the ombudsman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to go into the question of how the rent is collected by that rent collector, but I would be wrong to do that, because I am sure that he does it in an excellent way. If there is no conflict between the job and a person's wish to be a councillor of any political party, no doubt he or she will obtain exemption for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the hon. Gentleman's final comment of the hon. Member for City of Durham—I set the scene in my own constituency because I did not want to appear to be offensive to anyone—I said that if a council lays down the principles, someone has to apply the principles to individual cases. I hope that, in Durham, the individuals are not decided by the council. That would be a real
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>190</span>
scandal. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the council decides who gets which house? That would be an extraordinary way to proceed. Surely, the council lays down the principles and the individual who is responsible has to make an independent decision about applying those principles. An independent decision of that nature must be divorced from party politics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not give way for the moment because I am trying to finish the sentence. I have been relatively generous in giving way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The individual who seeks to apply the rules and regulations laid down by the council is someone who needs to be clearly independent, and it would not be appropriate for that person—be he or she poorly paid—to be a member of another council as a politically elected member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is so gracious, and we much appreciate it. The council lays down a policy, lists are drawn up, tenants' names go on the lists for allocation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I thought that we would get into this trouble. We are now having a debate on the housing allocation policy of councils. Unless the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) relates his intervention directly to the clause, I shall have to rule him out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I am saying, Mr. Hunt, is that the officer who would be responsible for allocating houses would go directly to the list and start with the first name. There is no choice for or pressure from officers. The lists are there and they clearly show who gets a house; it is what the officers allocate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in difficulty, Mr. Hunt. If I answer the hon. Gentleman, I shall incur your wrath.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Risk it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I chose this individual because in many cases the system is neither as clear or as unambiguous as is suggested. It is not just a matter of a list of people that is held by the council. The list may include people who come to the council in need of immediate housing because of priority, as well as people, as in my area, who have priority because of the tied cottages legislation. At some stage, someone has to decide who has the highest priority. There is someone who advises the council on the laying down of the policy and on its application to the myriad of cases in a complex area, and that person should be independent of any suspicion that he is an active supporter, candidate or member of a political party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervene on the Minister's choice of officer in support of his case for clause 2 because he has widened the mechanics of local government and, in so doing, has gone far beyond what is in the Bill. Moreover, I suspect, that he does a great disservice to the vast majority of local government employees who cannot be accused of allocating houses or anything else for favours. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will withdraw that slur on local government, because it does neither himself nor his case any service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) will read with great care what I said, because I did not use "favours" on any occasion. It is the hon. Gentleman who should think again, because the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>191</span>
Government support the vast majority of local government officers who do not wish to have their professional integrity impugned and who therefore, in a self-denying ordinance, do not take part in the party-political activities that are proscribed in the Bill. They say that it is not possible to do that and be seen to be independent. I am the one who supports the integrity of local government officers, and Opposition Members would do the cause of local government more good if they accepted that it was right to have a distinction between those who seek party-political office and those who are independent officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that ground, clause 2 should stand part of the Bill. It is widely supported and it is the effective implementation of the Widdicombe report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to think that there is a seething sea of discontent among the general public, who say either that there is great abuse or that if there is no abuse, there are highly political officers who hold positions as chief executives or housing allocation officers. Has the Minister any evidence of that public discontent? So far, he has failed to produce any. Has he received any letters from members of the public complaining about the political twin-tracking role of housing allocation officers or chief executives? I accept that he has not mentioned any specific cases of abuse, but is there any evidence that there has been abuse where officers have used their political ideology to subvert the way in which they carry out their professional work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the first question is yes. The answer to the second question is that I need only remind the hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth) of his earlier helpful contribution about Mr. Hatton. It was a good example. He ended up by saying that Mr. Hatton was sacked from Knowsley because he was not doing any work in Knowsley, not because of any impropriety. He was sacked because he was not doing enough hours, even though he was allowed two and a half days off each week, and not because anyone felt embarrassed by his being in the one place as an independent officer and in the other as a highly contentious deputy leader of the council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two. I apologise to the hon. Gentleman. Mr. Hatton was just half a day lower than he would have been had he been the titular leader as well as the apparent leader.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem for the Government was that most people's post contained letters of complaint about Mr. Hatton—that applies even to those who do not represent seats in the area. The complaint was not that he did not work hard enough for Knowsley—it related to how he managed to be a highly party-political figure in one place and an independent officer in the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received a number of letters about the choice of the assistant chief executive of the London borough of Hackney, on whose short-list were two people who were active, party-politically elected councillors in Lambeth. People asked, "If we do not agree with them, how do we relate to whichever one is chosen?" One was chosen. That seems a sufficient example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In what the record will show was an extremely short speech, if one takes out the interventions, I have tried to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>192</span>
say that the issue is clear. A person decides to be a politician or a local government officer. That is the only way in which to defend the civil liberties of the majority of officers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to put on record the fact that the clause should not stand part of the Bill and, in particular, should not be imposed upon the Scottish people against their wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that his speech was short in length. It was also short on substance. He said that if a chief executive is to retain the confidence of the whole council it is very important for him not to become involved in any of the types of political activity that are listed in the Bill. They include being a Member of Parliament, a Member of the European Parliament or a councillor. He could not write or speak publicly on matters of political controversy, or hold office in a political party. He could not canvass or stand as a candidate for elected office of any sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Being denied the ability to do all those things does not mean that the chief executive has a non-political profile. The Bill has omitted a series of activities in which the chief executive could continue to participate. He could continue as a member of a political party. He could attend party political meetings. At election time, he could drop leaflets through the doors of individual constituents because that would not be canvassing. I take it that under the terms of the Bill, dropping leaflets is not canvassing. He could march in demonstrations against a council or Government. He could march in the front row and have his picture taken in such a demonstration. He could collect signatures in a petition against the poll tax, for example. He could put a poll tax poster in his window, or belong to a political party. In short, he could have a high political profile. Another person could refer in the council to his activities and give him a high political profile, but the Bill does nothing about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's central argument—that the proposal is necessary because one has to maintain the appearance of independence—falls because it is possible to be seen to be a highly political character and still be chief executive of a council. The Minister has not commented on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same argument applies to officers at the other end of the local government scale—to the people who the Minister thinks allocate houses on the basis of political affiliations. He has no understanding of housing, especially Scottish housing. The Minister said that the circumstances outlawed by the Bill might lead people to have nasty thoughts. If people have nasty thoughts about local government in Scotland, England and Wales now, they have a positive way in which to deal with them. They think about the elected councillors who have appointed someone to a given post and decide that those councillors are responsible for putting party political people in local government posts. They vow to sort them out at the ballot box by voting them out of office when the next opportunity comes. They do not need the Bill to defend their rights as citizens. People can deal with councillors who get out of line and appoint people on party-political lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting, therefore, that we should repeal all the laws on bribery and corruption on the basis that, so long as the public cannot vote for someone if they think he is being bribed and corrupted, somehow that is all right? Do we not have bribery and corruption laws to protect people? No doubt the hon. Gentleman is also suggesting that we repeal the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>193</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister completely misses the point. We do not suggest the repeal of any laws on bribery and corruption, particularly in local government. I speak with some experience as I come from Dundee, where some elected councillors have been found guilty of corruption and sent to goal. The integrity of local government officers has often been called into question in that city. Of course we need laws to protect the public from bribery and corruption, but we do not need to protect the public from the realities of party-political life in Scotland, England and Wales. They can defend themselves through the ballot box against any party-political manoeuvring.

The Minister pretends that clause 2 will protect ordinary people throughout the United Kingdom against local government officers becoming involved in party politics, but it does not. As I have explained, local government officers will continue to be party-political animals and to be seen to be party-political animals, with or without the Bill. The only way in which the Minister can prevent that is to outlaw every political activity of local government officers, including membership of a political party, but even this Government baulk at the idea of preventing any citizen from joining any political party. That is why the Bill is a half-cock measure that will not work, cannot work and should not work. We oppose it and clause 2 for that reason.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My opening remarks are not aimed at you, Mr. Hunt, or at the Committee, but I want to point to the difficult position in which the Committee finds itself. Only two Committees—those on the Electricity Bill and the Water Bill—are the focus of much public attention arising out of events outside the House, and it is difficult to see the value of what we are doing in a Committee that is considering a Bill that has been revealed as an ideological measure from a Government who strongly oppose the former consensus that led to the establishment of the procedure of Standing Committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to see the value of our arguments about genuine concerns and alternatives when they are not taken seriously by the Government. Amendments are overruled, even to a Bill to privatise water authorities. Not one amendment has been accepted to that Bill, and it looks as though this Bill will receive the same treatment, yet we are expected to sit late into the night. To be honest—I say this in a light-hearted way—the only things that are likely to be passed in this Committee are chest infections, 'flu and colds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There was a time when consensus politics made Standing Committee procedures a great deal more relevant than they are today. This is a serious issue. Conservative Members may think that it is clever to keep a debate going for as long as possible to make a political point. I am interested in achieving something for the people whom I represent. At the end of the Committee stage we shall judge whether the Minister is willing to listen and to take suggestions on board.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have described the suggestion of setting a figure that disqualifies people from political activity as unacceptable. The notion of people of being openly involved in party political activity has been described as despicable by Conservative Members. Irrespective of whether we choose particular categories or whether we set an income level above which people are disqualified, the Minister has suggested in the debates on clause 2 and the amendments to it that openly held political views are unacceptable and are to be disparaged. Time and again, he and his hon. Friends have said that that undermines public confidence in the appointed officials of local authorities. To suggest that is to undermine our confidence in open democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In West Germany—I use this example because simply looking at our navels is unproductive—council officials often declare their party-political allegiance. They are known as CDU or SPD or Free Democrat, and no one suggests that that disqualifies them from the confidence of the public. We established the system after the second world war, and were proud of it. We were proud that people were willing to put on record the fact that they held political views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notion that an income level or a category of disqualification prevents officers from being party political or from holding strong political views is nonsense. The notion that it is despicable for them to hold such views, and that it undermines confidence in them when they do, is also nonsense. Does the Under-Secretary of State suggest that setting a limit of £13,500 and saying that it will disqualify officers in some parts of the country or in some jobs but not in others will enhance democracy, increase confidence and enable people legitimately to be involved in politics? Clearly, it does not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest, and I shall suggest very strongly outside the House, that every officer who earns more than £13,500 a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>196</span>
year should use the appeals mechanism. I say every officer, to protect those who seek exemption from these proposals. That is the only way in which to prevent people from being fingered and treated as though they are criminals, as has been inferred this afternoon and on other occasions in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If people feel that, by seeking exemption, they declare themselves to be political—no matter what the party—and thereby undermine confidence in them among their fellow officers, elected members or the public, they will jeopardise their promotion prospects and the job that they are doing. The only way round that is to suggest that all officers seek exemption to establish the categories that will be free to take part in party politics—to be the chair, secretary or treasurer of a constituency association, or to00 be able to do what we previously took for granted as a natural and acceptable practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the heart of this debate is the difference between those who believe in political democracy and those who believe in market democracy. People can do what they like in a market democracy. They can employ their friends and ask them to lobby and obtain contracts, but they cannot have open, above board, perfectly legitimate political views held by people in public office, so political democracy is to be discredited. That is what is behind the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is not founded on the evidence that was collected during the Widdicombe committee's deliberations. Its clauses do not appear anywhere in the research that was done. They are simply a way of seeking to discredit people who are involved in politics but who happen to be employed in public employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the Minister of State and the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick) suggested that it was bordering on corruption or unacceptability for one authority to employ the leader of another, even though the individual concerned might have been employed for many years before becoming the leader. If we take democracy seriously and bear in mind the fact that we shall have to amend or replace the legislation at some time in the future, we must establish the intention of clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not be concerned about whether people who earn more than a specified income will be discredited by being involved in open party politics or about the politics of certain categories of people, such as those who sit on reception desks, and who are perhaps able to influence events. We want to know the real intentions behind a Bill that smacks of McCarthyism, undermines people's confidence in the process, and leads us to believe that what is being proposed is far more unacceptable than the occasional abuses which we acknowledge have taken place and which could have been dealt with by a reasonable code of practice agreed with the local authority associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could have done away with people's fears and worries and prevented the introduction of draconian legislation which undermines people's confidence in the legitimate process of politics. The clause is not in the best interests of members of this Committee, nor is it in the best interests of party politics in Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is my reason for speaking. The rest of the Bill has to be judged in that context. The first two clauses establish a precedent in terms of civil and human rights which, if carried further, would be a major infringement of what we have stood for during the past century. [HON.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would ensure that the Secretary of State appoints an adjudicator to hear an appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At our first sitting on 23 February, the Minister of State said:
	<br><q><p>"First, I should say, in case there is any doubt, that the Government will, if the Bill is enacted, appoint such an adjudicating officer, but it would be silly to put that provision in the Bill. The Bill gives the Government the power to make such an appointment and I now undertake that we will do so."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee G,</i> 23 February 1989; c. 33.]</p></q>
The Minister gave an undertaking, but that is not law and would not be interpreted as such in a court. Suppose that the Bill is enacted with the word "may" in the provision. Moreover, suppose that we took the matter to court and said to the judge, "The Minister said that he would give an undertaking and he did so. Will you therefore rule that there must be an adjudicator to hear appeals?" The judge would laugh; he would think it absurd and would not be the only one to do so. Many of us have sat on Committees and heard the Government give undertaking after undertaking. But one big criticism is that so few of their undertakings have been honoured. That is sad. There are many such examples, not least in connection with the recent housing legislation which dealt with assured tenancies. There is a major problem about the Government's real commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister might think us silly not to accept his undertaking, but will he explain why he will not change "may" to "shall"? If he gives an absolute undertaking that there will always be an adjudicator, surely it is right to include that in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is creating categories of politically restricted posts, and the Secretary of State can then restrict the political activities of those in such posts. When challenged on the sense of such an absurd proposition, the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>198</span>
Minister says that if someone does not like the outcome he can appeal. The Minister does not make it a requirement in law, however, that there must be someone to whom an appeal can be made. He merely gives an undertaking that such a person will be appointed. There will be doubt in our minds because of the Government's reputation and because of the wording of the clause. The word "may" is permissive; the term "shall" would place a requirement in law on the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to the Minister that this is the first occasion on which he should recognise from the logic of his own arguments that the amendment should be accepted. There is a clear case for including "shall" in the provision. If the Minister is serious about his undertaking, he should have no problem accepting the amendment. He could say, "Quite right, it is logical that there must be an adjudicator. It is logical to include that requirement in law ans so we shall accept the amendment."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the clause is drafted, there will be a statutory restriction on civil liberties, but no mechanism for appealing. As I said in an intervention, both the Minister of State and the Under-Secretary of State have several times justified their proposals by reference to the Civil Service, but the Civil Service has a much more sophisticated appeals system. The Minister argued that the Bill's proposal is much fairer because someone who is right outside the system will be appointed. The argument about whether it is fairer depends much on the appointment, how it is made, who will be appointed, and whether the appellant can have representation, for example. There are many unanswered questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important factor is that civil liberties are being removed. The Minister cannot dodge that, as he attempted to do earlier when he said that he was more worried about the civil liberties of the electorate. If that were so, he would not be a member of a Goverment who so joyfully abolish elected authorities such as the metropolitan counties, the Greater London council and the Inner London education authority, all of which were Labour-controlled. Such action does not demonstrate much commitment to local democracy. Moreover, he would not be a member of a Government who have been progressively and determinedly undermining local democracy; indeed, they are doing so much damage that it is becoming increasingly difficult for councillors and officers to serve the public with the sense of being supported by their Government, as they used to do in the past under both Labour and Tory Administrations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our argument is clear. There is no clear mechanism for appeals. That is not the position in the Civil Service. The Minister said that he will ensure that there is a mechanism, yet he includes a provision which clearly means that the Secretary of State or his successor need not appoint an adjudicator. Even if we accepted the Minister's undertaking verbatim, we should remember that he might not be the Minister in a month's or even a week's time; he certainly will not be a Minister in a couple of years' time, that is for sure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot rely on such an undertaking. If the Minister really meant what he said at our first sitting—that is, that there will be an adjudicator; he gave that undertaking—the logic is overwhelming that such a provision must be enshrined in law. In view of what he said, there can be no justification for doing otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0528">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>199</span>
There are no real provisions in the Bill to protect rights. Instead, there are provisions to deal with alleged abuses. The Government have been inept in citing significant examples of such abuse. Indeed, the Widdicombe report did not regard abuse as a serious problem, and the Conservative-controlled London Boroughs Association and the Association of District Councils referred to the Minister as using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. There are examples of the Government having set a low standard with some of their appointments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our central argument is tight and enables me to be relatively brief. The clause continues the process of undermining democracy; but, on 23 February, the Minister gave a commitment which could not have been clearer. It is now incumbent on him to demonstrate that his commitment is genuine. He should accept the amendment, which would simply enshrine in law what he said he was determined to do. That would enable the courts to decide exactly what was meant and would not leave the matter as an undertaking in a column in 	<i>Hansard</i> which must be interpreted and which, as we all know, is not given the force of law if brought before a judge in court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to consider what he said, recognise the logic of his own argument and accept that the amendment is necessary, desirable and would be useful in the courts. It would ensure that everyone could appeal to an adjudicator.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Truro)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall add my support to the amendment. It provides an opportunity for the Minister to prove that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be unable to prove that to the hon. Member for Brightside because he has left the Committee again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But I am sure that he will read with interest the report of our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment. From everything that he has said about the Bill, one thing is clear: he believes that the original Widdicombe proposal went too far in that it gave no right of appeal for principal officers and above. Therefore, it would be extraordinary if the Minister did not accept the amendment which would simply include in the Bill the appointment which he gave a commitment to make. The question is not whether he will still be a Minister in a couple of weeks' time. Even at the rate of turnover of Ministers in this Government, the odds are reasonable that he will still be a Minister at the end of our Committee proceedings on the Bill. There is also the matter of future appointments. They might not be repeated under a different Government, or under different Ministers. Although the Minister may be honourable and determined to ensure the appointment, that may not always apply in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is hard to see why the Minister should resist the amendment because it gives him the opportunity to show that we are not entirely wasting our time sitting here debating these points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no objection to the amendment. We have been shadow boxing only because everyone knows that the Government have no intention of not appointing an adjudicator. Despite his mellifluous, but
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>200</span>
somewhat extreme, phrases, the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) will accept that, having given an undertaking, the Government will honour it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall explain the measure and suggest an alternative that might please the Committee better. I want to respond to some of the doubts that have been expressed about the adjudicator, the terms under which he will adjudicate, his position, to what he would refer and how the procedure could work. On Report, I shall bring forward an amendment to put the procedure in a proper context and provide hon. Members with the opportunity to discuss it further, which is the right way to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for using the word "may" and not "will" is simply the pedantic legal way of referring to the appointment of one, or more than one, adjudicator. It will be possible for one adjudicator to adjudicate in England and Wales, and another to adjudicate in Scotland, for one to do the whole lot, or perhaps for there to be three.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister clarify whether the reference to the Secretary of State in line 16 of clause 3(1) also refers to the Secretary of State for Scotland? Further, in clause 3(3)(a) it says that the Secretary of State may:
	<br><q><p>"appoint different persons under subsection (1) above for England and for Wales".</p></q>
Does that in any way diminish the right of the Secretary of State for Scotland to appoint people for Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is perfectly right. It is possible for the same person to be selected by the Secretary of State for Wales and, for instance, the Secretary of State for the Environment. However, we are not discussing that point. I am trying to explain why the word "may" and not the word "will" was used in the clause. No wicked undercurrent was intended—we were simply advised to use "may" by our legal terms experts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A reasonable way in which to proceed is for me to give the Committee an undertaking to bring forward an amendment on Report that will clarify more exactly the way in which the adjudication system will work—the Committee has considerable control over the time scale and whether I carry out my undertaking. That undertaking is given in response to the points made by both sides of the Committee. The amendment will ensure that the Secretary, or Secretaries, of State make such an appointment. If that meets the purpose of the amendment, perhaps the hon. Gentleman will accept my assurance and withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the sort of undertaking that I can cope with because I can hold the Minister to it and expect to get some change. I am encouraged and think that we are making progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the Minister will bring forward an amendment on Report, but we are in danger of following the example of the Housing Act 1988 and of making legislation on the hoof again, as I said earlier. I hope, however, that this will be the first of many concessions from the Minister, and I am prepared to accept what he said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister brings forward his amendment, I hope that he will not simply stick to the point that an adjudicator will be appointed. He seemed to imply that he will look at the way in which that provision is structured. The Government are getting themselves into difficulty when this measure is compared with the Civil Service provision because they are unsure whether they are saying that the Civil Service system is a good one to be followed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0529">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>201</span>
or a bad one to be abandoned. If this system is supposed to be better, are we to assume that the Civil Service will be given a better system of this type?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the Minister's civil servants hold a view about that but do not want to express it for fear of being accused of twin-tracking. I urge the Minister to think about that carefully. I believe that the Minister acknowledges, as I understand his argument in Committee and on Second Reading, that he is restricting certain civil liberties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister argues—I do not agree with him—that he is looking after the greater good of the community outside. He, at least, seems to concede that that means encroachment on the civil liberties of the officers involved. If that is right, it is important for the adjudication system to be right. If a decision is made wrongly, or even if it is made rightly without fairness being apparent, we will fall into the classic trap of justice not being seen or felt to be done. One reason why the Civil Service system is probably better is because a staff person is involved in the system. I believe that there is a strong case for doing something of that nature here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have a cut and dried system up my sleeve. I simply say to the Minister that, although he has given an undertaking to come back on Report with an amendment to meet our requirements—which I accept with pleasure—he should think through how that is done to ensure that the civil rights of people who will be seriously affected will be protected by a system that is not only seen and felt to be fair, but is fair.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to what the Minister said to my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) on the previous amendment about an adjudicator being appointed, I understand his predicament. According to the notes on clauses, the appointment of the adjudicator and supporting staff is not left entirely to the Secretary of State for the Environment. The notes say:
	<br><q><p>"With the agreement of the Treasury the Secretary of State may provide for the appointment of such support staff for the person appointed as he thinks fit."</p></q>
Therefore, the appointment of an adjudicator is not left to the Secretary of State. There must be agreement with the Treasury before the adjudicator's support staff can be appointed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is to make adjustments to the procedure, it would be better to have a "panel of persons" to examine the question whether someone should be allowed to continue his or her political interests while serving as a local authority officer in a restricted post.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier the notes on clauses say:
	<br><q><p>"The Government therefore propose an additional category of posts which will be subject to political restriction which will include any officer (not otherwise covered) who is paid £13,500 or more a year. Any officer within this category will be able to apply to an independent person, appointed under clause 3 of the Bill by the Secretary of State, for the restriction to be removed."</p></q>
The notes continue:
	<br><q><p>"The person appointed under this clause has the power to issue directions exampting an individual from political restrictions on such terms as he considers fit."</p></q>
That arrangement is unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members have advanced the philosophy that we must ensure that local government officers who serve the public are free from political directions and that they are independent so that they can give clear views and carry out their responsibilities honestly. It is difficult to conceive how an officer appointed by the Secretary of State can be independent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The majority of appointments in local authority services are political. To try to convince the Committee and the public that an adjudicator appointed by the Secretary of State with the approval of the Treasury will be independent is stretching the imagination of Committee Members and the public too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would establish a panel of experts in local government who would adjudicate on appeals in general, whereas the Bill provides for a single appointee of the Secretary of State. We challenge the equity of appeals being heard by a Government appointee. There should be a panel of three, five or whatever number of members we

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>203</span>
decide. I suggest that a panel of three would adjudicate on a matter of such magnitude far better than a single appointee of the Secretary of State or a Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the chairman of an industrial tribunal is a political appointee? If so, why are not all cases decided in favour of employers or of appellants?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's philosophy in that an industrial tribunal has a chairman, a member from the employee's side and one from the employer's side. Under our amendment there would be a legal man or someone appointed by the Secretary of State as chairman, but there would also be other people to offer assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick) agrees to such a panel and persuades his colleagues to accept it, I shall sit down on the understanding that the amendment will be accepted and that there will be a panel instead of one individual appointed by the Secretary of State in agreement with the Treasury. If the hon. Member for Hallam believes that that would be a better arrangement there is nothing between us, but his silence shows that he is now backing down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Gentleman has wandered slightly. I am not the Minister. I asked a question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the hon. Member for Hallam asked me a question and I have replied. I accept that the chairman of an industrial tribunal is an independent person, but the panel also contains representatives of the employer and from a trade union or other organisation. If Conservative Members wish, we can increase the number on the panel to five. If they wish to involve other people I have no objection. I object only to the fact that the Bill refers to the appointment of "a person". A panel would be far better, more democratic and more in keeping with the example of industrial tribunals, to which the hon. Member for Hallam has drawn our attention, or of tribunals that consider cases under the Social Security Act 1986. Those procedures have not one person but a tribunal, as the amendment suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman arguing that a judge sitting alone in court is a political appointee, unable to listen to the evidence from both sides, and that he always comes down on one side? Is the hon. Gentleman saying that a judge always comes down on, say, the Conservative side, or does democracy always prevail?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The argument of Conservative Members that one person should be appointed is not in keeping with what has been said in the past. The Minister has said repeatedly that the restrictions imposed on local government officers are less onerous than those imposed on civil servants. If that is so, why do civil servants have the right of appeal to a panel of three? The hon. Member for Hallam has not heard that point. We have been told that the comparison should be with civil servants—that that is a mirror of what should apply to local government officers. If that principle is the basis for the legislation, why will local government officers be judged by an individual appointed by the Secretary of State? Civil servants have the right to appeal to a panel of three which includes a trade union representative, a member from the establishment and an independent chairman. A local government officer should have the same right of appeal to a trade union representative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>204</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The ombudsman is appointed. Is that a political appointment? He listens to both sides—the evidence from the council and from whoever is appealing against the council—and then decides. The Health Service commissioner listens to similar evidence. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that they are political appointments? If so, there are some odd decisions. I believe that they are apolitical, but I can see both points of view. I have expanded my example from an industrial tribunal, to that of a judge and finish with the ombudsman. I accept that it is possible for one person to take a decision. A lady is now the ombudsman for Sheffield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hallam is seeking a peg on which to hang his case. He changed his example from a judge to a tribunal and when I knocked him down and said that I was prepared to accept tribunals, he shifted to the ombudsman. There is a difference between the work of an ombudsman and that of an individual who will decide the destiny of officers in local government. The ombudsman has no authority—he can only report. He cannot take action against a local authority who does not comply with his recommendations. Under the Bill, the individual's decision is final. That is why a panel, not an individual should be appointed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would have more confidence in the impartiality of the appointees were it not that the Government have a long record of appointing political activists in non-political posts. I can give the hon. Member for Hallam examples if he wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said at a previous sitting:
	<br><q><p>"My concern is about the ordinary person who goes to the town hall for advice … He must know that the officer is independent and acting as an officer."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee G,</i> 23 February 1989; c. 19.]</p></q>
The Minister is now saying that a local government officer who wishes to appeal will be heard by someone appointed by the Secretary of State. There is no guarantee that the person hearing the appeal is not politically motivated. The Government's track record on political appointments is worrying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister earlier mentioned someone who was appointed as chief officer in two authorities which demonstrated his independence. I shall give a couple of examples. The chair of Tower Hamlets health authority is Mrs. Anne Mallinson, who has been a Conservative councillor in Westminster since 1974 and was Lord Mayor for the municipal year 1986–87. How can the public be sure that her decisions are informed and impartial? Her local political career was as a Tory. How can we be sure that she is now acting impartially? How can we be sure that the chairman of the Yorkshire health authority, who was a Conservative candidate in more than two elections is politically impartial?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is widening the debate. We must concentrate on the panel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was replying to the hon. Member for Hallam who asked me if I considered certain appointments to be political. I promised the hon. Gentleman that I would give him examples of political appointments. If the hon. Member for Hallam will stick to the example of a tribunal, that is acceptable, but there are many examples—there are lists of them—of political appointments and I am trying to ensure that the appointment of adjudicator is not in the same category.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0531">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>205</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always easy to give the example of a Tory. What about the chairman of Wakefield health authority who was not reappointed. We both know him well. He was appointed by a Tory Minister—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That individual was sacked because he would not carry out the policies of the Government on the cook-chill food system. That explains exactly the Government's views on appointment to senior positions on health and other authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick) is making is that that individual was appointed by a Minister in a Tory Government. There are many other examples in which the political connection is perfectly clear to all and sundry. I am responsible for appointing people to development corporations and so on. The hon. Gentleman and I have discussed the matter on many occasions. The political allegiance of such individuals is well known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are as anxious as the hon. Gentleman to ensure that the person appointed as adjudicator is completely independent and has no direct or indirect connection with a political party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Government's track record, a panel of persons, rather than an individual should be appointed to that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister cannot name one member of the Labour party who is chairman of a health authority in Yorkshire, because none exists. If the same applies to appointments under the Bill, local government officers will be worried. In the interests of fairness, a panel in line with that for appeals by civil servants should be established for local government officers. Civil servants can appeal to three people, one of whom is a trade unionist representing the appellant. We ask only that the same procedure applies for local government officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill proposes a dramatic shift in the terms and conditions of service of local authority employees. We have heard that Conservative Members are defending the interests of local government officers, but the Bill deals with twin-tracking and other political activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the regulations refer to party-political activity, which is not specified in the Bill. It is wholly inappropriate that local government officers who are affected by the restrictions can apply to only one individual. From the Government's record on appointees, I understand the concern that will be expressed by local authority employees who appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 52 proposes an additional subsection under which
	<br><q><p>"A panel established under subsection (1) above shall number at least 3 and not more than 9 persons and shall consist of equal numbers of persons appointed on behalf of
	<ol>
	<li>the local authority organisations;</li>
	<li>organisations representative of local authority employees, and</li>
	<li>the Secretary of State."</li>
</ol></p></q>
I told the hon. Member for Hallam that we would accept a nominee of the Secretary of State to serve on the panel, but that it would be more fair, honest and just if the parties involved—the local authority and the person who is aggrieved—are allowed to appeal to a tribunal rather than to an individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 52 is a constructive proposal which tries to bring the appeals system in local government in line with that in the Civil Service. It tries to ensure that local government officers caught in the web of political
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>206</span>
restrictions have a proper defence and that they have an opportunity to put their case in the best possible light, as do civil servants. There is nothing wrong with the amendments, which would correct an error.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition have had a good day. I have been very reasonable with the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) and my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government has been extremely reasonable with the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley). I must tell the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) that with these amendments the party is over. I do not agree with one remark that the hon. Gentleman has made. It would be ridiculous and hazardous for more than one individual to adjudicate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two separate issues which we must consider carefully. One is political allegiance, on which the hon. Member for Normanton concentrated, and the other is whether more than one person should adjudicate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the political consideration, I said when responding to another amendment that not one member of the Committee had found fault with any individual appointed to the Widdicombe committee. I repeat that I believe that its membership is above criticism. No doubt plenty of Socialists, perhaps even some Conservatives and certainly democrats, could spend a disproportionate amount of time trying to find fault with the Widdicombe committee, which was set up and appointed by a Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My argument is valid. No one has been able to challenge it and I am glad for the individuals concerned. Some recommendations that the committee's members made as independent individuals are not very palatable to the Labour Members or to other Opposition parties, but it appears that from a political standpoint no one is prepared to challenge their appointments. A Secretary of State in any Government is capable of making proper appointments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sort of person whom my Secretary of State would consider appointing as adjudicator would formerly have been a chief executive of an authority or a senior local government officer, and would be highly respected. He would have done his job serving—dare I say it?—the whole council and not one faction. I do not suggest that it would be easy to make such an appointment, but it would be possible to find a number of suitable individuals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where on earth will the Minister get all these chief executives and senior officers? Their numbers are already pretty restricted, and more and more of them are fed up with the way in which the Government are politicising the role and say that they want out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: People are queueing up for such appointments. They are wearing out the carpet at the Department of the Environment, wanting to be placed on the list of the great and good for consideration for appointment to an urban development corporation or to some other body or quango. We are not short of volunteers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am encouraged to hear that the Minister has acquired a carpet at long last. It used to be that where the carpet started he stopped, but no doubt such matters have changed in line with his political career.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no evidence of a queue of people other than those who are already in the pocket of the Tory party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That remark is unworthy of even the hon. Member for Hammersmith. I am sorry that I cannot

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>207</span>
announce an appointment today or even this week, but soon I shall remind the hon. Member for Hammersmith about our exchange today. The person to be appointed to a certain post somewhere in England will receive the national support of the Labour party, our party and even of the democrats because we have canvassed widely on the appointment. At the appropriate time I will show the hon. Member for Hammersmith that there are people who have relevant experience and who can be seen as apolitical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On whether there should be more than one person, my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick) did sterling work on our behalf. He explained that there were many individuals with similar duties ranging from High Court judges, circuit judges, recorders and sheriffs to health commissioners and ombudsmen. This list is endless. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am sorry that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) keeps bouncing back into Committee. In his absence my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government accepted a point made by the hon. Member for Hammersmith. Every time that we are nice to the Opposition, the hon. Member for Brightside is out of the Room. If we draw the obvious conclusion, I strongly recommend that he stays outside the Committee for the remainder of our sittings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do what I want to do, and not what the Minister wants me to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the hon. Member for Brightside will keep making cheap jibes, but I shall get this off my chest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members consider that the contribution of the hon. Member for Brightside was a disgrace. The contributions made by his hon. Friends have, in the main, been constructive and we have taken some of their points on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton asked whether there should be more than one adjudicator. Why would that avoid the appointment of individuals who have no political allegiance? It would enhance the likelihood that those appointed would have a political allegiance. For example, it is usual for a trade unionist to be a member of an industrial tribunal. Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that a panel should contain someone with political allegiance to the Tory party, someone with allegiance to the Labour party and perhaps an independent or a Democrat, or a distinguished lawyer seeking preferment up the legal ladder. The amendment is absolute nonsense and we reject it. There is no argument in its favour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister stressed that the adjudicator would be impartial. The Secretary of State for Scotland has appointed at least four defeated Tory Members of Parliament to important quangos in Scotland since the previous general election. Will the Minister guarantee that the person appointed will not be a defeated Tory Member of Parliament?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made it clear earlier that those appointed to quangos such as urban development corporations had obvious political allegiances. We appoint Socialists, in some cases, to be deputy chairmen of urban development corporations. We have appointed members to the Lower Don Valley UDC in Sheffield, the noble Lord Mulley, a Labour Whip in the upper House, has been appointed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>208</span>
The adjudicator should be someone with local government experience who is respected by both sides. If he is not, the Secretary of State will be heavily criticised in the House of Commons and no onw will have confidence in him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is running out of steam. He illustrated the goodness in the hearts of Conservative Members and I thought that it was the start of the war when he said that the party is over. But he retreated like a lamb because he has no defence. He has not explained why local government officers cannot have the same facilities as civil servants. He has not said how they will get round the Treasury to provide back-up staff for the adjudicators. All we have heard from the Minister is a load of poppycock. He has not responded effectively because he has no argument. His replies have exposed his weakness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He spoke about the chairmen of UDCs, but there is not one Labour chairman of a UDC, because Tories believe in appointing their own kind. We suspect that the same will be true of the appointment of adjudicators. I shall be proved right when the appointments are made. The friends of the Conservative party in local government may be waiting for these appointments, but we want the system to be fair. That is why we propose a tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not satisfied with the Minister's assurance that the appointments will not be political, and we wish to press the amendments to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is apparent that the Minister will not accept the suggestion of a panel of adjudicators, and that the adjudicators will be appointed by the Secretary of State. Will an adjudicator, like an ombudsman, be required to publish the reasons for his decision or will it be a bland yes or no?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is no. He will not be required to do so under the legislation. I can give the hon. Gentleman some comfort. He has had some success in Committee today and I want him to continue in that vein. It will please the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend the Member for Normanton that prior to the appointment of adjudicators we shall consult and take the advice of the local authority association.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 71, in page 5, line 17, after 'consider', insert '(a)'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it may be convenient to take amendment No. 72, in page 5, line 18, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>'(b) and appeals by persons in posts deemed politically restricted by virtue of section 2 where a dispute arises with the employing authority as to whether any act or omission by that person constitutes a breach of regulations arising in relation to section 1(5).'.</p></q>
I tabled the amendment because I am worried that regulations under the Bill could severely affect the livelihoods, work and activities of many people in local government. I am less concerned with new appointees. My direct concern is with employees already in position who have been working for a local authority for many years and who hold strong views that they actively take up in the community. They may be directly involved in party politics or in activities outside the party arena that nevertheless involve party-political controversy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill contains an appeals procedure to establish whether a job should come under the restrictions, but there is no procedure for interpreting officers' actions once they have taken them. A few days ago we discussed the scenarios in which a school governor who was also a local government officer taking part in activities on opting out would be deemed to breach the regulations. The Minister suggested that they would be breached when the person went on the streets with a placard. I said that if that person addressed a meeting and spoke in strong terms against opting out, a member of the public might feel that he had gone beyond what a local authority employee should do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>210</span>
Such a complaint could give rise to actions against an officer—presumably by his local authority—and I hope that the amendment will allow the Minister to elaborate on what will happen when an officer appears to breach the regulations that govern the actions that he can take. We know that an officer cannot pursue his outside activities while he continues in his job, but it is not clear what will happen if it is felt that he has become involved in party-political activity. Presumably he would not be sacked on the first offence. What penalties does the Minister envisage?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations will be statutory rules. In earlier clauses, the Minister laid down guidelines on the activities in which officers should not engage. Local authorities will not follow their own rules but attempt to interpret what Ministers have laid down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not difficult to imagine a local authority using the statutes to crack down on an employee with well known political views and, perhaps unfairly in the officer's opinion, discriminating against him. We hope that in the first instance local authorities will have grievance procedures to deal with such circumstances. How certain is the Minister that suitable procedures will be in place in local authorities? The Bill contains no guidance. I do not claim to be an expert on every local authority, but it is not clear how authorities will operate the regulations and what intepretations they will have to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When employees currently in post were appointed, there were no such rules. Now, officers are told that the Government have forced the regulations on local authorities. However genuinely officers believe that their outside actions involve no infringement, their local authorities may come down on them in a way that seems too harsh or discriminatory or which is based more on political history than on the activities in question. The statute and the Minister's words in Committee might be used to justify what most members of the Committee would feel were unsuitable actions by local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment probes the issues and suggests that officers should have access to the national appeals procedure on whether their posts should be politically restricted and on whether they have breached the regulations. My amendment does not need much more explanation. If the Minister can respond helpfully, I hope that I will not have to press it to a Division. Indeed, I am not sure whether the amendment is the most appropriate solution, but I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to destroy for ever the reputation that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) has given me by telling the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) yet again that I hope that I can meet him in a satisfactory way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall first take the hon. Member for Truro through the procedures that are available at present. The circumstances that he describes would involve conditions of employment. Almost every local authority has a grievance procedure through the purple book, a copy of which I have here and which is available to any member of the Committee who wishes to read it. It contains a great deal that has nothing to do with that issue, but other parts give a grievance procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are one or two—there may be more—local authorities which do not have that because they have local agreements of a different sort with trade unions or other
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0534">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>211</span>
representatives of the staff. If a local authority's behaviour is totally out of proportion, there is the second step of the industrial tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment does not provide a satisfactory answer for three reasons. First, there is the technical problem that, although it provides a system, it does not say what happens when the system is invoked. Secondly, I am concerned not to double and treble the mechanisms that are used. There are mechanisms in place and I would not want there to be yet another parallel mechanism. Thirdly, some people would be prevented from doing certain things because the local authority had taken that decision in any case. Some local authorities already have clear views about the party-political activities of a much wider range of people, so there is the problem of their using their ordinary rights as an employer—I am not a lawyer, but they have that right under common law, I suppose—to say, "If you become my employee, this is one of the conditions which you must accept." They may insist on excluding employees in certain jobs from a range of activities, so there is the problem of what to do about an authority which has made that decision on its own. There would have to be a different appeal system for people who are excluded under the terms of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened to the hon. Member for Truro carefully and considered what he said. I hope that he will take it as axiomatic that I want to provide as much opportunity as possible for people to feel that they are properly dealt with, and I give an undertaking that if I think that there is anything unsatisfactory, I shall seek an alternative method and come back to the Committee with anything that I produce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a useful little debate, partly because it demonstrates the incredible hole which the Government have dug themselves. The Minister has told the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) that he is aware of the problem and is trying to find regulations and ways of dealing with it. This Government say that they want to reduce bureaucracy, but here they are creating a new one, on a clause whose short title is:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Exemptions from political restriction." We have a bizarre, Kafkaesque—the Minister may not like that word—world in which the Minister has to decide whether people's activity is political, to appoint people to check whether it is, to set up an appeals procedure, and to take on board whether an individual can or cannot do certain things such as putting a political poster in a window. It is bizarre. It is also a little frightening and worrying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is driving me towards not being generous to any argument made by the Opposition. The hon. Member for Truro asked only whether the arrangements which are normally made cover all the opportunities. I said that I shall see whether that is so and that if I feel that some people might be excluded to their detriment, I will see whether there is a way of getting round the problem. That seems a perfectly reasonable thing to say in a Committee. If a Committee is to mean anything, as the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) said, that is exactly the type of offer which one must make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's having an outburst of that sort does not solve anything. The point is that the Minister's proposal is absurd, as I said about the concession that he made. He is creating a monstrous structure that is supposed to deal with political
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>212</span>
involvement but, apart from a few members of the Government, nobody in his party or in local authorities admits that there is a problem that is worth legislation of this type. The Minister is producing all these new regulations, and clutching a purple filofax which will presumably contain them. The hon. Member for Truro picked up a relevant point, and if we stayed on the subject long enough, we could produce lots of other examples which would necessitate another purple filofax—or a green filofax, which I suppose would be more in keeping with the political persuasion of the Prime Minister these days, so worried is she about environmental issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the Government's proposal is bizarre and slightly worrying. Why have they made it in a clause headed: "Exemptions from political restriction"? What are a Government doing giving exemptions from political restrictions to local authority personnel? If this was happening in the Soviet Union, we would say that something was seriously wrong. We would say, "This isn't right. People are supposed to be able to take part in politics properly, freely and openly". Not any more. It is something else that is being undermined and destroyed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a minor matter. The Minister says that he will give no more concessions, but any concession that I get from him will be given simply because he is embarrassed by the situation or realises that he has dug himself into a hole. He will not give it out of generosity to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I explained to the Minister some time ago that I was here to help him. He will find that difficult to accept, but he needs to understand that his relationship to me is rather like that of a client to me when I was a probation officer, particularly just before my recommending a life sentence on the ground that the person was a risk to public health and safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has got it wrong, and he knows it. He is morally wrong, and factually wrong in many of the instances which he cites. He is denounced by his supporters in the Association of District Councils and the London Boroughs Association, but he constantly ignores it. He constantly ignores what his own councillors say. He has no respect for them. They will not get any concessions either. He simply says that the Government are going to create this incredible set of regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Truro picked up a point, and the Minister conceded that there might be a problem. I think that the hon. Member for Truro is probably right, and that there will be problems in many other areas. There will be many abuses of power because of the Government's proposal. We will have set up an incredible structure which bears no relation to anything that happens in any other democracy that I know of, and we will have done it because of the prejudice of this Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's ignorance of local government needs to be underlined. The so-called filofax was not invented by me. It contains the rules which local government already uses. It is the scheme of conditions of service set down by the National Joint Council for Local Authorities, Administrative, Professional, Technical and Clerical Services. It is called the purple book. The hon. Gentleman has shown once again that he speaks from the outside looking in from a very narrow, ideological point of view. That is a great pity, because I had hoped that, despite the differences between the two sides of the Committee, when we could agree, we would.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0535">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>213</span>
I repeat that the hon. Gentleman will not prevent me from continuing in the direction chosen by the Government, and it is a pity that we should constantly return to the wholly improper comment that the Government are doing something which nobody else wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the Widdicombe committee, an independent committee whose composition was welcomed by all sides of the House and whose report the Association of Liberal Councillors said was a vindication of all that it had been fighting for, proposed a tougher regime than the one which the Government propose. The regime has not been taken out of the air. It was suggested by an independent committee, and we are legislating for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman must not keep quoting the Association of District Councils as having some reservations about the methods which we have chosen, and ignoring the fact that it is in favour of the basis of our proposals and has always said so. It does not like twin-tracking. There is no doubt about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the hon. Gentleman must accept that he and a very small number of people in his party are on their own in this respect. Most people are ashamed that legislation is required and would have expected our proposal to be the normal behaviour of responsible people, as it has been for 100 years. Yesterday, there was a service to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Association of County Councils. Throughout that period most county councillors, and probably most district councillors, and their predecessors would have been sad if such legislation had been necessary simply because natural behaviour had been overthrown—as it has been in the past 10 years by those who behave in this odd way and I believe that someone can be independent in one place and party political in another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) seems worried about the present arrangements for appeals in the event of a local authority acting in such a way—perhaps by accident, misjudgment or by thinking that something is insufficiently party political to have an effect—that an individual is unprotected. In my view, that will not happen because the grievance procedures and the usual legal arrangements fully cover the matter, but I shall re-examine it to ascertain whether there is a significant problem. If there is one, I shall be happy to return with an alternative proposal. I hope that the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) will consider that his proposal is not the best way to proceed and will therefore withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have said, I am not convinced that the amendment, as drafted, offers the best approach. I welcome what the Minister said. Perhaps I also provide a service to the Committee in that the only thing on which anyone can agree is that I might have a point, but I hope that we can progress beyond that at some stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the reason for my doubts relates to clause 2(3) which states:
	<br><q><p>"The duties of a post under a local authority fall within this subsection".</p></q>
It then describes them. The Minister said that he did not wish to add to that. My fear, which was echoed by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) earlier, is that there is insufficient definition to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>214</span>
ensure that someone has the protection for which he might hope. How a local authority could pick someone up under the provision is undefined, so it might be used in an arbitrary way on which the courts and others were powerless to act. I welcome the Minister's response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendent, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 48, in page 5, leave out lines 21 to 23.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 73, in page 5, line 23, after 'paragraph', insert '(f) or'.</p>
	<p>No. 74, in page 5, line 23, after 'paragraph' insert '(g) or'.</p>
	<p>The other amendments grouped with amendment No. 48 are tabled by the SLD. Amendment No. 48 would extend the appeals procedure to all restricted staff. I draw the Minister's attention to what he said on 28 February:
	<br><q><p>"Making an appeal to an adjudicator is open to each individual and I can see no reason why an adjudicator might not say, for example, that those involved in running crematoria will not need to ask individually for permission to become involved in political activity because we may accept them as a group."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee G,</i> 28 February 1989; c. 94.]</p></q>
He then gave a wider area. I note that the Minister has left the Committee just when I was dealing with his comments.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it will be difficult for the Minister to reply and that he is being discourteous?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has difficulty replying to what I say, whether or not he has been here. His presence does not seem to be the determining factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, those comments are misleading. I hope that the Minister can tell me if I am wrong, but I doubt whether he can. I understand that the appeals procedure applies only to those who earn £13,500 a year. Clause 2(1)(h) is the relevant linkage that refers to £13,500. That link gives the right of appeal, but we cannot assume it in other circumstances. Perhaps that is the Government's intention, and what the clause states. If that is right, the Minister should tell the Committee how it can be interpreted in that way. Our interpretation is that the appeal seems to be restricted to those who earn £13,500 per annum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's arguments seem to be moving towards acceptance of everybody having a right of appeal. They have not yet said that, but the Government are accepting some of our arguments that an appeal system is necessary. The Government have accepted our amendment saying that an adjudicator "shall be" appointed rather than "may be", which I understand was the Government's intention in the first instance. In those circumstances, it would be difficult to judge an appeal system that was restricted to those who earn at least £13,500 per annum. Many other employees of a local authority will be drastically affected by the Bill. They will also be affected retrospectively, but as far as I can see the Minister has not written into the Bill a right of appeal for them. That must be wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am now giving the Minister another opportunity to demonstrate that he understands the argument and can accept the amendment, which ensures that any member of staff who is affected by these political restrictions—which the Government now seem to accept are infringements of their civil and democratic rights—has a right of appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0536">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>215</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two amendments in the group are weaker than the others. Instead of giving a general right of appeal, we have given the right of appeal to two groups about which we felt strongly. We have always accepted what the Government have said about chief officers and their deputies. Our concern is for political advisers and those defined by local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no point in elaborating on the merits of adding paragraph (g) because the Minister has given a commitment to go away and look at that and we do not want to go round in circles debating the same issue all night. Paragraph (f), which is about political advisers, came across strongly in Committee because the equivalent staff working for Ministers in the Civil Service have formal rights of appeal, and that should be the case here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I presume the answer will be the same as was given on the previous amendment—that the rights are provided through the local authority system. In that case, my answer is that exactly the same hole, and potential difficulties, will appear. I hope that the Minister will treat the amendment in the same way as amendments Nos. 71 and 72.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the amendments one by one. Amendment No. 48 proposes the deletion of clause 3(2)(a). Its effect will be that an independent person, on the application of any person holding a politically restricted post, not just those who come under clause 2(1)(h), will exempt that person from political restrictions. At present, the only posts that are eligible for consideration for exemption are those in clause 2(1)(h), as the hon. Member for Hammersmith suggested—that is, those not otherwise caught who earn over £13,500.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 74 would enable persons who are listed by the local authority under clause 2(1)(g) to apply to the independent person for the political restrictions attaching to their posts to be removed. Amendment No. 74 therefore achieves part of the wider amendment No. 48, as the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We resist both amendments. First, they conflict with the recommendations of the Widdicombe committee and the White Paper because—I do not know whether anyone has said this before—the Widdicombe committee did not recommend an appeal. That should be on the record. The Widdicombe committee said very clearly:
	<br><q><p>"The need is for a simple rule without exemptions".</p></q>
Secondly, we believe that a general exemption mechanism is inappropriate. The most senior posts—the head of the paid service, chief and deputy chief officer appointments, and the monitoring officer—routinely involve advice to elected members, and it is clear that there will be conflict between their duties and political activities. There is no need for a right of appeal. Similarly, the duties of the posts that the local authority will be forced to list as politically restricted are such that there is a clear conflict between their duties and political activity. A right of appeal is, in our view, appropriate only where there is a general prohibition, as in clause 2(1)(h), which focuses not on the precise duties of the posts but on a general salary level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I tabled amendments No. 73 and 74 because of the effect on those who are in post. They should have a way of registering their discontent with the local authority's decision. That is not as true of special advisers as it is of the other cases in which the local authority is trying to interpret the Government's rules. I hope that individuals will have some way of saying that, in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>216</span>
their view, the local authority has misinterpreted the rules. Would that, too, be in the purple Filofax that the Minister for Local Government waved about earlier?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, our proposal brings certainty. A general right of appeal would introduce both uncertainty and delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, the amendment would cause duplication. As for the posts that the local authority has identified as meeting the statutory criteria, the independent person would be duplicating the local authority's work. Each local authority is aware of its own local situation and should be responsible for listing the posts that meet the statutory criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) drew attention to the exemption arrangements in the Civil Service rules, but what happens in local government is very different, as the Widdicombe committee said, from that which takes place in local government. Basically, manual and non-officer workers are politically free in the Civil Service; our proposals are narrower and more sharply focused, as they should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is amazing. Next time some poor devil, charged with a criminal offence, goes to court, the judge will say to him, "We can't allow you to appeal because it might cause uncertainty and delay." That is the justification that the Minister uses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the example of a person who goes to the European Court of Human Rights—accepting, as the Government now seem prepared to do, that civil rights are being eroded—and is told, "You can't appeal because that would cause uncertainty and delay." It is a stupid and grossly irresponsible argument, and one that shows contempt for democracy and for the rights of individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have introduced a nice little rule about people who earn more than £13,500. The rule may be simple, but it is wrong, and we all know that it is wrong. The Minister is saying that there are exceptions and ifs and buts surrounding it, but, basically, some staff will be unable to appeal. The Minister justifies that by saying it will cause uncertainty and delay. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Is the Minister's right hon.

That uncertainty and delay is far less serious than the problem of someone who has had his rights infringed. We are talking not about a minor issue but whether people can engage in the proper democratic procedures of a democratic state. The Minister is saying, "No you can't in certain circumstances because we shall rule against that; in some we shall allow you to appeal but in others we shall not." In this country we call that arbitrary Government, which is entirely unacceptable.
