<div class='page-header'><h1>Finance Bill</h1></div>
<p>(Except clauses 1, 32, 33, 44, 51 and 138)</p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>"That the order in which the remaining proceedings on the Finance Bill are to be taken shall be Clauses 166 to 168, Clauses 170 to 173, Schedule 16, Clauses 174 to 180, new Clauses 9, 10, 21, 22, 23 and 35, Clauses 98 to 108, Schedule 12, remaining new Clauses, new Schedules, Schedule 17."—[<i>Mr. Norman Lamont.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The motion surprises us. It is the second to re-order the work of the Committee that we have had to discuss. The Bill is long and technical, and at the start of our proceedings, the parliamentary Opposition made it clear that we would work our way through the Bill in a thorough and businesslike way and would not frustrate the Government unduly in the conduct of their business. Therefore, we are a little perturbed that the Financial Secretary is seeking to do just that.<br><br>
I do not know whether the Chief Secretary or the Chancellor is aware that, not only has the Financial Secretary led a putsch against two clauses that the Chancellor inserted into the Bill, but he has backed down on the original proposals covering close companies. Furthermore, he has arranged for the Ways and Means motions that must be discussed on the Floor of the House to be debated tomorrow, so that those of us who wanted to discuss the close company proposals will be unable to do so.<br><br>
Conservative and Opposition members of the Committee have been frustrated in their natural desire to make progress on the Bill. Perhaps the Minister was forced to table such a weedy motion, so that we must discuss several new clauses of varying degrees of controversy, including an amendment tabled by one of his own Back Benchers, to slow down the Committee. That is a peculiar way for the Government to make progress. After the events of last week and the weekend, many Opposition Members fear that such action signifies the beginning of the end. It gives me no pleasure to see the Government in such disarray. Perhaps the Minister is making a power bid of his own. It is difficult for us to understand the Government's intention. However, as you, Mr. Cormack, are better versed in the Byzantine ways of Conservative party politics, perhaps you will be able to pinpoint the reason behind the motion. We cannot facilitate such an arrangement, and we shall press the motion to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. A. J. Beith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick-upon-Tweed)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Here we go again. The motion to re-order our consideration of the Bill again shows the Government's confusion.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 500</span>
It will make life difficult for those who administer legislation outside the House. In many respects, the legislation that they must administer is that which we have not yet passed. They are making tax arrangements and ordering companies' affairs for the current year. That process will be affected by many of the clauses. Far be it from us to suggest that the Government fail to change their mind when they are manifestly wrong. Indeed, the more often they do so, the better we shall be governed.<br><br>
The procedure by which the Government introduce technical tax legislation is wrong. It does not allow for adequate consultation. Therefore, the Government are forced to abandon their clauses and introduce complicated new clauses and amendments at a late stage. The measures in the Bill on which the Government adopted a different procedure and consulted widely beforehand, such as those related to the Keith committee proposals, progressed quickly through Committee. That procedure has been generally regarded as acceptable. However, we persist in dealing with detailed, major tax legislation by a process that leads to the Government discovering that they have it all wrong at a very late stage. That is not for their good or that of anyone else, so perhaps we should adopt a two-stage procedure for detailed tax legislation.<br><br>
After studying the Government's motion, I am not sure of the basis on which they selected the new clauses that they believe that we should discuss while they get on with their work on other matters. However, I look forward to discussing new clause 36 on snuff, tabled by the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton). I believe that one of the next business motions is designed to ensure that we discuss that matter and perhaps some of the valuable new clauses that I have tabled, to give the Government more time to get on with further study of some of the clauses that they originally introduced. Indeed, I am beginning to think that by late July we shall still be discussing further new clauses that the Government have asked us to table, to ensure that they can have still more time to discuss the clauses that they got wrong in the first instance.<br><br>
All that illustrates that the Government are in rather a mess.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Norman Lamont)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) appears to be under a misapprehension as to why we tabled this re-ordering motion. The only reason for it is that the Committee cannot proceed in the natural order of things to debate the close company provisions, because they require resolution on the Floor of the House. For various reasons, that resolution could not be taken until tomorrow, so the natural order of the Bill could not be observed. I thought that it would probably be for the convenience of the Committee if we debated as much as we could rather than preoccupy ourselves with the mere three or four clauses that came before the close company provisions.<br><br>
I felt that the Committee would want to debate several issues, and all that I have done is to bring forward some of the Government new clauses that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0288">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 501</span>
do not require resolution on the Floor of the House. There is no great mystery about the motion and it signifies very little.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to correct the Financial Secretary, but the close company provisions in the Bill do not require a Ways and Means resolution of the House before we can discuss them. As I understand it, it is the Government amendment that requires the Ways and Means resolution, and as we are not supporters of it we would be happy to discuss all the close company clauses tonight, if that were the wish of the Committee, rather than discuss new clauses now. After all, we would normally discuss new clauses now. After all, we would normally discuss new clauses at the end of our proceedings on the Bill, so I do not believe that the Government should be allowed to rearrange the whole Bill, not for the convenience of the Committee, but as a shoddy climbdown of their own. Therefore, we should like to vote against the motion.</span></p>

Clause 166</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
GIFTS TO HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, South and Finsbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 489, in page 133, line 22, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"or registered co-operative housing association;".</p></blockquote>
When we debated clause 125, which makes provisions for gifts of land or property to registered non-charitable housing associations, I asked whether housing co-operatives are included in the overall definition of housing associations. The Financial Secretary supported the broad principle that I enunciated—that housing co-operatives should be included in the provision—but said that he was not sure of the precise standing of housing co-operatives under that clause.<br><br>
Since then, I have examined the Housing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 502</span>
Associations Act 1985 and it appears that the definition of housing co-operatives in that Act is different from the definition of housing associations. Section 1 of that Act is headed:
<br><blockquote><p>"Meaning of 'housing association' and related expressions"</p></blockquote>
and gives the obvious definition of "housing association". It then defines the meaning of "fully mutual housing association". Such associations and co-operatives are composed entirely of their members and are controlled by them. The Act then states that a
<br><blockquote><p>"'co-operative housing association' means a fully mutual housing association which is a society registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965".</p></blockquote>
My understanding is that "housing association" does not include the concept of fully mutual housing co-operatives, which appear to be separately defined in the 1985 Act. If we wish to ensure that fully mutual housing co-operatives are included in the advantageous tax provisions under clauses 166 and 125, that must be spelt out in the Bill.<br><br>
I have tried to echo the Government's wording of the clause in line 21 on page 133, which refers to "registered housing association". The Housing Associations Act 1985 defines not "registered housing associations", but "housing associations". I presume that the term "registered" is deemed to mean registered by the Housing Corporation. It would have been helpful if the Government had spelt that out as it is unclear. The Government may wish to think about that because a housing co-operative can be registered by the Housing Corporation and by the registrar of friendly societies. If the term "registered" is taken simply to mean the registrar of friendly societies, we may find that a housing co-operative or even a housing association that was not registered by the Housing Corporation could qualify for tax relief under the clause.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
I am sure that the Government did not intend that. I think that we would all agree that Housing Corporation registration is a test that should apply in such circumstances if favourable tax treatment is to be made available. The other point that the Government might care to think about, as well as clause 125, is whether the term "registered" should be spelt out as being specifically intended to mean registered by the Housing Corporation.<br><br>
The principal purpose of our amendment is to ensure that housing co-operatives as well as housing associations can benefit from the taxation arrangements that the Government are making available. The Housing Associations Act 1985 is strictly defined and the Government must ensure that housing co-operatives are included specifically by name and with reference to their definition in the 1985 Act, so that they will benefit, too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) raises a valid point, which, as he said, he mentioned before when discussing the parallel provision on capital gains tax and the exemption on an increase in the value when gifts below market value were made to housing associations. I do not know whether the hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0289">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 503</span>
Gentleman has received my letter that I wrote to him explaining the position. As I said, his remarks are valid and were worth spelling out. However, it is not necessary to amend the Bill in the way suggested by the amendment. The Clause exempts from inheritance tax, gifts or sales of land below market value, to non-charitable registered housing associations. Charitable housing associations already enjoy relief from inheritance tax. The clause extends relief to gifts of land made to non-charitable housing associations.<br><br>
To qualify for the proposed relief, it is necessary for the association to be registered with the Housing Corporation under the Housing Associations Act 1985 and part VIII of the Housing (Northern Ireland) Order 1981.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Seven.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says, "Seven". I am informed that it was 1981, but I stand to be corrected.<br><br>
As registered co-operative housing associations, like any other registered housing associations, are on the Housing Corporation register, they will qualify for the exemption proposed by clause 166. The Bill refers to the Housing Associations Act 1985, so I believe that it is unnecessary to mention co-operatives specifically in the way suggested by the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
Co-operative housing associations that are not registered are not subject to the monitoring procedures of the Housing Corporation. In the main, they are privately funded co-ownership schemes, whose tenants may wish at some point to realise some equity in the property held by the association. Those are quite different objectives from those held by registered co-operative housing associations, whose aim is to provide long-term rented housing for people in low-paid employment and housing need.<br><br>
The majority of co-operatives will be registered housing associations, but if some choose not to register, they will put themselves beyond the proposed relief in the same way as other housing associations that elect to remain outside the Housing Corporation register.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman has made a valid point, but it is covered in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for his response and for writing to me, although I have not yet seen the letter.<br><br>
I wish to correct one misapprehension. When I interrupted from a sedentary position to say "Seven"—rather than eight—I was referring to part VII of the Housing (Northern Ireland) Order 1981, to which clause 166 refers.<br><br>
I accept the Financial Secretary's comments about registration. Clearly, it is right that only associations or co-operatives that are registered with the Housing Corporation should be able to qualify for such relief, and I am glad that he confirmed that the clause will ensure that. However, I am a little worried about whether housing co-operatives are included in the umbrella term "housing association", as defined in the Housing Associations Act 1985. I take on trust
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 504</span>
the Financial Secretary's assertion that they are covered, but my reading of the Act differs from his. I accept that he has given the best advice that is available to him, but if it were to become evident that housing co-operatives may slip through the net and not be eligible for the relief available to housing associations, I hope that the Financial Secretary would consider sympathetically a return to the matter later in this Bill, or during discussions on a future Finance Bill.<br><br>
Although I am still worried about that aspect, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before dealing with the amendments, may I raise a point of order, Mr. Cormack. Many Opposition Members who, like myself, are members of Amnesty International, are rather worried about the whereabouts of the Paymaster General. He normally attends our sittings and we are wondering whether you could inquire about his whereabouts. I do not make that request so that he is required to attend the Committee, but simply because we should like an assurance that he is safe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member knows that that is not a point of order. He also knows that the Paymaster General's whereabouts are no concern of mine.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fully accept that they are no concern of yours, Mr. Cormack. I did not wish to know the whereabouts of the Paymaster General; I wanted to know that he was safe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tatton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Cormack. Would it be for the convenience of the Committee if the hon. Gentleman were to lead a search party to discover my right hon. Friend's whereabouts?</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 505</span>
are absent from the House today. Doubtless, they are together.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to accept your explanation, Mr. Cormack, and, as always, to be guided by the Chair.<br><br>
I welcome clause 167 and congratulate the Financial Secretary on sticking to his guns and holding out against the pressure to withdraw the clause or radically to amend it in such a way that it lacked bite. The right hon. Gentleman may rest assured that he can count on the wholehearted support of the Opposition in giving legislative effect to the clause.<br><br>
Our amendments seek solely to probe the position of charities and are in no way intended to undermine the important principle at stake—the rights of the Exchequer set against the rights of the beneficiary of someone who has died and who would be obliged to pay inheritance tax. The public purse is no less deserving a beneficiary of an estate than the next of kin or other individual who would benefit from the bequest. There is no way of determining the real intentions of people after they have died unless they have been set out in a legally binding document. A person's wishes should not be interpreted by a beneficiary of the estate or by someome who has a close relationship with a beneficiary. Short of holding a séance or receiving some form of divine guidance, it is difficult to know what a person who has died intended unless a clear statement is left.<br><br>
The clause is perfectly reasonable. It also eliminates a loophole which created advantages for those who belong to fairly wealthy families. After all, one does not pay inheritance tax until after the sum of £118,000 has been allowed for. The purpose of inheritance tax is to prevent large sums of money going through established families from father to son or daughter. There should be some way of breaking such fortunes up and allowing the wealth to be redistributed.<br><br>
Despite these points of principle, one issue has given us pause for thought: the position of charities. This raft of amendments is designed to draw attention to certain matters with which later amendments seek to introduce alternative ways of dealing. I am happy to discuss which is the most acceptable with the Financial Secretary in Committee or on Report, if he wishes to amend the clause on Report.<br><br>
The first point, which may be the most worthy, is to do with disclaimers. At present, when a beneficiary under a will disclaims the inheritance, it is possible for that inheritance to be given to a charity. Charities that do research into cancer may well benefit from the next of kin of a cancer victim saying, "No, we would rather the money went into research into the disease that the deceased died of. A decent and well-motivated person might well say that. I do not understand why, under such circumstances, the tax system should not recognise the position of reputable charities that do such good work.<br><br>
It is right to make provision for disclaimers and, in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 506</span>
exceptional cases, for relatively rare, but significant circumstances. Let us take the example of two sisters of roughtly the same age who live together. If one leaves her assets to the other, but the second sister wants the estate to go to charity and she dies soon after, it is possible for the charity to reclaim the inheritance tax within two years. That would not be possible under the clause. In such special and exceptional circumstances, it is right to allow the present position to prevail. If I misunderstood how the current system works, I am sure that the Financial Secretary will put me right. Our argument would advantage legitimate charities under the tax system in exceptional circumstances.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
The other issue that we want the Financial Secretary to examine—I do not make this point so strongly—concerns cases in which the thresholds in the tax system can be adjusted, albeit slightly, by a small bequest to a charity, so that tax relief is claimed and the size of the rest of the estate is diminished. When it is proposed that a charity be advantaged in those circumstances, we think that a concession could be made. The concession that we favour is set out not in this raft of amendments, but in the next, so I shall say a little more about it then.<br><br>
The Government's attempts to help charities, through the payroll-giving scheme for example, have not been a complete success. The impact of these proposals on particular charities may be quite severe. I understand that legacy income accounts for as much as 80 per cent. of the total income of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. The clause, unamended, will have a significant effect on that income. That seems to be unintended and unnecessary. The broad thrust of the clause is clearly right, but it is also clearly right to make regulations for the effect on charity. That is not difficult. Our amendments are designed to facilitate such a purpose, which should command the support of the Committee and the wholehearted enthusiasm of the Financial Secretary, as we back him in his struggle to get the clause through.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) offers me his congratulations on sticking to my guns with the clause. That is a poisoned chalice, which I propose to drop, just as I propose to advise the Committee to drop this clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can I have misheard? Is the Minister saying that he intends to urge—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Two hon. Members cannot be on their feet at once. If the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) wishes to intervene, the Minister must give way. If the Minister does not give way, the hon. Gentleman cannot intervene.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I may have misheard, but is the Minister saying that the pledges that the Chancellor gave to the House in his Budget speech and on Second Reading, which were put in this clause and were clearly

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 507</span>
intended to become legislation, are now to be voted down by the Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sometimes the hon. Gentleman is extremely persuasive. When he offers support upon support for our measures, I know that perhaps we have not got it quite right. We are recommending that the clause should not be proceeded with, but perhaps I could first outline the background to the clause and the reasons why we have reached that conclusion.<br><br>
The present rules allow certain redirections of assets in an estate after death to have retrospective effect for inheritance tax purposes. These rules were introduced in 1972 to meet a particular need—which has ceased to exist—to give time for wills to be rewritten following the introduction of the spouse exemption. Later they served to prevent two lots of tax in quick succession—once on death and a second time on the lifetime rearrangement. But since the ending of a tax charge on most lifetime giving in 1986, that has also ceased to be a major consideration.<br><br>
In addition, more recently the beneficiaries of some estates have used the current provisions for instruments of variation and distributions from discretionary trusts purely as a means of reducing tax liability. Here the will is rearranged not necessarily because of any change in family circumstances or hardship but simply because of the desire to create a minimum tax bill on the estate, or even no tax at all, and the proceeds of the estate are then in practice distributed in some other way. The most blatant example of that is when, after the instrument of variation, the property is redirected back precisely as its testator had originally directed in the will.<br><br>
In recent years, the number of instruments of variation has increased, particularly since capital transfer tax was replaced by inheritance tax. The purpose of inheritance tax was that if people retained property and did not take advantage of the opportunity that had been given them to pass on property free of tax, provided that they lived seven years, there should be a tax on death. That was the principle of inheritance tax, and it was because there has been an increasing use of instruments of variation since its introduction, precisely to avoid the charge on death, that we originally decided to bring forward this clause.<br><br>
I know, as a number of my hon. Friends have pointed out to me, that instruments of variation in many ways serve a socially useful purpose and that sometimes it is difficult when people are elderly to get them to rearrange their affairs in a sensible way. That is often a painful, difficult and embarrassing thing to do. One can draw a distinction between the use of instruments of variation in the sort of blatant tax-planning way that I have described and their use for other purposes.<br><br>
We have thought about the matter long and hard. There did not seem to be a practicable way of targeting a measure specifically on the abuse; in any case, the continued existence of a facility to rewrite the tax consequences of a death estate retrospectively is itself wrong once the original
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 508</span>
justification for it had largely gone. So the intention in principle was to prevent changes to tax liabilities after death. That was the thinking, and I still think that there is a strong argument in principle for the reasoning behind clause 167. The clause catered for genuine family need by ensuring that rearrangements using instruments of variation which make appropriate provision for the surviving spouse or other dependants would continue to have retrospective effect for inheritance tax. And instruments of variation—though without the tax consequences—could have continued to be used in other cases.<br><br>
However, since the Bill was published and since we made the announcement, we have received very strong representations from the Law Society and all the accountancy bodies. We have received a large number of letters, many of them from solicitors and lawyers. In particular I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) who wrote a well argued, moderate and cogent memorandum against clause 167, which played a significant part in altering our thinking on the clause. My hon. Friend pointed out, as did the Law Society and the chartered accountants, that in many ways a clause could effectively be avoided by those with access to the appropriate advice, while it would cause major inconvenience to those who had arranged their affairs on the basis of the present law, especially the elderly.<br><br>
As regards the point that it would be possible for people to avoid the effect of clause 167, I know that some of the consequences of the post-death use of instruments of variation or of discretionary will trusts would be achieved by the appropriate rewriting of the wills themselves. The objective of clause 167 was not to stop that, but to draw a line between arrangements at death, when inheritance tax is meant to bite, and post-death rearrangements. However, the extent to which appropriately drafted wills could achieve what is now by an increasing number achieved post-death is relevant to the judgment of whether the clause is worth while in revenue terms, and whether we would raise the amount of money specified in the Red Book. Another point put to me is that if sufficiently elaborate permutations are written into the will, this can be achieved to a greater extent than I had previously thought.<br><br>
Given that those with access to the necessary advice would in practice go to such lengths to achieve the best tax results, is the tax saving that will remain sufficient to justify the inconvenience to those concerned in the context of will-making? I have been persuaded that to proceed with clause 167 in its present form might penalise some people without access to the best legal advice, but it would be sidestepped by people with access to the best advice, and thus would not bite on the most wealthy.<br><br>
This is not an easy matter to quantify or judge, but having heard all that has been put to me, I have concluded that the matter needs further consideration and that we should not proceed with the clause.<br><br>
I still think that there is justification in principle behind the purpose of the clause, but I want to see whether we cannot find a better, more focused way
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0292">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 509</span>
of addressing the problem and specific examples of abuse. It is not easy to find a device to do that, but we intend to keep the matter under review. Next year we may come forward with a more targeted, specific measure to counter abuse of the present facility.<br><br>
I have been persuaded by the large number of representations, not from people who stood to gain, but from people who felt that their clients would be greatly disadvantaged by the compliance burden and that a vast number of people would have to make adjustments to their wills. That argument persuaded me that in the end what we would get out of the clause would not justify all the inconvenience and hassle involved in it. I advise the Committee not to proceed with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Arbuthnot <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wanstead and Woodford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cormack. In view of the welcome remarks of my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary, would it be convenient if the debate on the amendment took a fairly wide course? That might save time for the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am prepared to be reasonably lenient. However, in view of the Minister's clear statement that he wishes to see the clause deleted, I shall watch with care what is said.</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are strange and exciting times, as the Government abandon their Bill clause by clause. I welcome the Minister's decision, but I hope that my support will not have the same effect on him as the Labour party's support had on his previous position, and encourage him to change it.<br><br>
The Minister is right to withdraw the clause. It would have had undesirable effects. He enumerated some of them, but did not mention the fundamental problem of inheritance tax—it has become almost entirely voluntary. The tax is paid only by those who do not have the skill, foresight or advice to avoid paying it. Had the clause been implemented, it would have strengthened still further the advice in the <i>Investors Chronicle:</i>
<br><blockquote><p>"you shouldn't do anything—least of all, die—without first consulting your accountant."</p></blockquote>
The clause would have affected many people who would not be considered wealthy in terms of income, particularly in view of the rise in house prices. Although their one large asset may be worth a lot of money on paper—namely, the house that they or their surviving spouse lived in, or a property which had been passed on and was no longer lived in, but which was the only significant item of the estate—but their incomes may be low.<br><br>
The clause would have penalised people who had not planned or updated their wills, so it would have penalised those without access to advice, who had not thought it necessary to obtain advice or who had obtained advice a long time ago.<br><br>
The clause could also have affected many family businesses in which a father passes on his shares, or 50 per cent. of their value, to his son. The amounts involved could have been sufficient to damage a young company.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 510</span>
There are special cases in which the abolition proposed in the clause regarding deeds of arrangements could have been extremely damaging—when damages were awarded to a parent for the care of a disabled child, for example. The proposals could also have affected cases of compensation being paid when someone dies as a result of an accident. When the compensation is received before death, or goes to the estate afterwards, the proposals could have affected the passing on of that compensation to the spouse, who may also have been injured in the same accident and has particular need of the money.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) mentioned the problem of charities, for which significant sums of money are involved. The Charities' VAT and Tax Reform Group has said in a letter that the benefit to the Imperial Cancer Research Fund from deeds of arrangements is about £100,000 a year, while the Royal National Institute for the Blind receives about £50,000 a year, and the Jewish Blind Society, £20,000 a year. A recent deed of variation resulted in an additional £20,000 for Methodist Homes for the Aged. To have proceeded with the clause would have caused unnecessary harm to those charities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have much sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's remarks about charities. The amendment would protect charities, were the clause to remain in the Bill. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will tell us that he will support the amendment before he votes the clause out of existence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman wants to play safe by ensuring that the clause is amended before it is defeated. I suppose that we could go through that procedure. As I agree with the amendment's objective, I would have supported it.<br><br>
The Minister makes the perfectly fair point that deeds of arrangement can be and have been used as a complex tax avoidance device on large estates to which none of the circumstances that he and I have described apply. He is looking for a way to do something about that, and said that he might introduce new proposals next year.<br><br>
Using the Minister's proposal as a starting point, we tabled a starred amendment which is designed to cap the available relief, or to ensure that the relief would be available only on relatively small estates. We put the figure at four times the £118,000 threshold, but one could obviously argue about the appropriate level. That might be one way of approaching the matter, and it would tend to exclude from the protection very large estates and those to which the human considerations I have mentioned might not apply.<br><br>
There are ways in which this can be done. The hon. Member for Maidstone (Miss Widdecombe) has tabled an amendment with a similar effect. Obviously we will not plough through all those ways this time round, but the Minister may be able to look at the matter in that light. If he looks at inheritance tax he ought to consider its purposes and how it can be operated as a genuine tax rather than as a tax that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0293">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 511</span>
falls mainly on those who do not have the foresight to avoid it. He ought also to consider whether it might be more appropriate to apply the accessions tax principle, and to tax the recipients rather than the donors, particularly if the purpose of inheritance tax is to encourage the wide distribution of capital at death or at the time of large lifetime gifts. If the tax has a social purpose other than merely adding to the Revenue, that purpose would be better served if the recipient were taxed rather than the donor, simply because that would encourage wider distribution.<br><br>
I cannot accept the principle enunciated by the Labour Front Bench spokesman that the Revenue is always as deserving a candidate for the munificence of the testator as any beneficiary he might care to choose. I do not think that that is so. I certainly do not think that the Revenue would be a beneficiary preferable to my wife if I were in the happy position of being able to leave her such a large sum of money—not to mention other deserving causes, including the Methodist Homes for the Aged. We must ensure that if we design a tax with a social purpose it achieves that social purpose, and that if it is meant to be a tax, it is not an almost entirely avoidable tax. The Minister must address himself to those considerations when he creeps away with his new clause stuffed back into his briefcase and has a fresh look at a problem which has so far defeated drafting.<br><br>
The Minister should not feel embarrassed that a stated Budget policy of the Chancellor's has been defeated in Committee. The Chancellor never mentioned it in his Budget speech. It emerged only in an Inland Revenue press release and is perhaps an example of the Minister having taken heed of the argument, which I have put several times on our business motions, that major changes in the tax regime and major new tax proposals are worthy of proper and detailed consultation. If that cannot be done, they should not proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Having listened to the speech that has just been made, and also in response to an earlier point of order, this is what I propose to do. I shall not call any other amendments to this clause—the selection list is, after all, my provisional selection—nor do I propose to allow a debate on clause stand part. I shall let the debate run now. The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) has treated this as a clause stand part debate, and I will allow other hon. Members to do likewise.<br><br>
A Division is expected in the Chamber at 5.30. We will adjourn for 10 minutes today on Divisions; but at 6.30, we will adjourn for two hours.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arbuthnot</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Minister has listened to representations from up and down the country and from many members of the Committee. In my view, he has come to the right decision. I am truly grateful to him. It is not just that he made some kind remarks about me, although I thank him for those. They do not matter. What matters is that he has got the law right to the benefit of the entire country. My only sadness is that it is now unlikely
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 512</span>
that a statue will be erected to him outside the law courts with the words "The Lawyers' Friend" on the plinth. He will have to bear that with fortitude.<br><br>
The clause has various defects, most of them individually decisive. It does not work in what it sets out to achieve, except in the most quirky of circumstances. It is unnecessary because its aims are already achieved by the present law. It favours the rich and the well-advised. It unsettles families, and hits charities and the mentally incapable. It has the extraordinary effect of discriminating between Scottish and English taxpayers. It does not even raise much revenue and, as its meaning is unclear, it will cause litigation. Its only advantage is that it would create a flurry of work for the Chancery Bar, which might be considered a minority taste.<br><br>
If, as we should, we accept my right hon. Friend's recommendation to drop the clause, the Committee will have done its job, and done it well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, thank my right hon. Friend the Minister for his statement and for a statesmanlike decision on the clause. Since I came to the House, I have never been so happy to tear up a prepared speech as I was when I heard his remarks.<br><br>
I hope that hon. Members in every quarter of the House share the growing anxiety that, with every Bill that we pass, we are increasingly producing complex legislation which it is difficult for our fellow citizens, and sometimes for us, to comprehend fully. There is no subject about which we should have greater anxiety on that score than the Finance Bill. First, Finance Bills bite directly into people's financial position. Secondly, Finance Bills are particularly complex, convoluted and technical.<br><br>
This Finance Bill is no exception. Even to an expert, the clause would be completely impenetrable without cross-referencing and the glosses that the Committee is lucky enough to have in the form of notes on clauses and other guidance from the Government. It is unrealistic to suggest that little old ladies in our constituencies should be expected to rush out every March or April to buy a copy of the latest Finance Bill, read it in its entirety, understand immediately any changes that it makes to existing Finance Acts and rapidly rearrange their affairs lest they die before they can put them in order. I cannot believe that anyone in the House, let alone in the Committee, takes the possibility seriously. To argue on the assumption that that is what happens up and down the country, as the Labour party appears to do, is to go in for the most heartless and cynical humbug. It is in that spirit that I listened to the comments of the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown).<br><br>
Many people have done well out of the decision. First and foremost are the great majority of people—not those whom the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) likes to call the super rich, who would have laughed had we passed the clause, but it is the rest of the country that would have suffered. In practice, we would have introduced a two-tier system into the administration of our Finance Acts.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0294">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 513</span>
Secondly, I add to the tributes of my right hon. Friend the Minister to my hon. Friend the Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) on the well-argued, characteristically modest, sensible and therefore effective case which, to my knowledge, he has put to the Government for several weeks.<br><br>
Thirdly, the legal and accountancy professions appear to come out of the decision extremely well. I was not aware of how much lobbying my right hon. Friend had received from the professional bodies to which he referred. From time to time in the House I have made unkind remarks about the legal profession. I might have occasion to do so again in future, so this afternoon I wish to say that today is clearly a good day for the integrity of the legal profession, as represented by the Law Society. Its lobbying on the Bill was clearly contrary to the immediate pecuniary interests of its members, albeit that it served higher purposes that we all recognise.<br><br>
This must be a good day for the Government, because they have demonstrated that they are prepared to listen to reasoned and sensible argument. What hypocrisy we hear from Opposition Members in the Committee. They say that the Government should think again, but when the Government think again, all that they can say is that the Government have gone back on a proposed clause in their own Bill. What hypocrisy.</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
<p>5.40 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To break off a peroration and to continue it 10 minutes later is like serving up yesterday's dinner cold. I do not intend to speak for much longer, but I have one essential point to make: our proceedings this afternoon have revealed an interesting aspect of the two parties' attitudes to the Bill and to wider matters. It has been made clear that it was the Labour party which wanted to introduce a tow-tier system of taxation. It wanted to provide that for the super rich—those with £15 million or £150 million, and their advisers, professional accountants and lawyers behind them—all would be well, while ensuring that those with £150,000, for which they had saved carefully all their lives for the benefit of their children would be clobbered. The Labour party has demonstrated this afternoon that far from being the humane and populist party that it pretends to be, it has complete disregard for the interests of ordinary people.<br><br>
It is the Government who have, this afternoon, shown great and humane awareness of the position of families in this country and a determination to structure the law so that the little guy has as much chance of a fair deal as the big guy. I am glad that the debate has brought out that important principle and clear distinction between the two parties. I hope that it will be noted not only in the Committee and the House, but in the country.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 514</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dennis Turner <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wolverhampton, South-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish, in words as eloquent as I can find, to tell the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) what a load of tripe his contribution was. What gall and temerity he has shown in accusing the Opposition of hypocrisy, when he knows that the Government have reneged on the clause!<br><br>***
We know where the real hypocrisy lies, and that the hon. Gentleman's contribution in support of his right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary is nothing but bluff and bravado.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Mitchell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gedling)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not seek to intervene for long in a debate that has perhaps gone on long enough. All the major points have been covered. However, I was one of those who saw my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary about the clause, as I had received a number of representations from those—not only in the legal profession—who feel strongly about it.<br><br>
I am grateful for the excellent decision that my right hon. Friend has made this afternoon, as I had four distinct criticisms to make of the provision. First, almost everyone who made representations said that the clause was a trap for the unwary, but not a serious hindrance to the sophisticated. On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Ynys Môn (Mr. Jones) said that
<br><blockquote><p>"We are also talking about people who have not the resources to gain access to expert tax planning advice, or who choose not to do anything about it. Those people themselves are not being penalised; they have left the scene. It is the families left afterwards who will have to face the crippling circumstances."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 25 April 1989; Vol. 151, c. 864.]</p></blockquote>
That was a telling point.<br><br>
Secondly, those who advise people in such circumstances have told me that a carefully drafted will and the use of the disclaimer would get round all the provisions and effects of clause 167.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
Thirdly, the clause would have caused a great deal of unproductive work for solicitors and for the Chancery Bar. There would have been an unnecessary churning effect on legal work on wills. It is a great tribute to my hon. Friend the member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot), a Chancery barrister who stands to gain a great deal if the clause is agreed to this afternoon, that he has campaigned vigorously and successfully against it. Thus he confirms what we have always known: his profession is governed by altruism and philanthropy.<br><br>
Fourthly, I agree with the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) that the clause would have been bad news for charities. They gain a great deal of money from variations that go direct without being liable for tax. If those variations are removed, a tax charge would arise.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend is to be congratulated on his decision. He had demonstrated—not that demonstration is required—that ours are a listening Government. They have listened carefully to many representations, have reached the right decision. I understand why my right hon. Friend was so keen to introduce the principles of the clause; it would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0295">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 515</span>
eliminate distortions and loopholes and further extend the excellent measures already passed, creating a level playing field.<br><br>
Variations address two specific situations. They allow families to do retrospectively what they should have done earlier; and they reflect changes that best meet the circumstances that families may face after a death, changes that they may have had no opportunity to effect earlier. I congratulate my right hon. Friend on listening to the arguments and accepting a good case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Gedling (Mr. Mitchell) may be right: the Government may be a listening Government. My difficulty is getting them to listen to me—[<i>Interruption.</i>]—I have some sympathy from the Tory Back Benchers. I am slightly reassured. I was a little hurt by being described as a heartless, cynical humbug. These are unsettled times for the Conservative party.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) deserves congratulations from both sides of the Committee. He has the wholehearted support of his colleagues. He has also achieved something that I always wanted to achieve—the defeat of a clause in a Finance Bill. I applaud the hon. Gentleman with envy, but it speaks volumes for the Conservative party's difficulties that the most welcome action of the Financial Secretary during the Committee stage of the Bill has been to do in one of its clauses.<br><br>
I was very moved by the right hon. Gentleman's speech. I congratulate him, especially on speaking with conviction about the wrongness of the increased use of instruments of variation as a tax avoidance mechanism. The Financial Secretary is right; I agree wholeheartedly on that, but it tells in favour of the clause.<br><br>
If we cannot believe an Inland Revenue press release, what can we believe? A press release dated 14 March states:
<br><blockquote><p>"At present, if the parties so elect, the beneficiaries of an estate can use instruments of variation to give retrospective effect for inheritance tax purposes to rearrangements of estates made within two years of death. This can be done for any purpose; and is being increasingly exploited to avoid inheritance tax."</p></blockquote>
That paragraph is included not to praise the avoidance of inheritance tax, but to herald measures that are designed to clamp down on it. The press release also states that the estimated yield from the changes is £5 million for 1988–89–90 and £15 million for 1990–91. It is clear, whether or not the Chancellor of the Exchequer said so in his Budget speech, that the Government were committed to this, so it seems wholly wrong that, having given such a commitment to what is so clearly designed as an anti-tax avoidance measure, the right hon. Gentleman should now seek to vote it down in its entirety. If difficulties such as those relating to the treatment of charities exist, surely the thing to do is to deal with them rather than to vote down the whole measure so that tax avoidance can continue.<br><br>
The Financial Secretary said that the Law Society has made representations. Both sides of the Committee have prayed the Law Society in aid. He
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 516</span>
told us that it decided that such measures are difficult and impractical, and that the administrative burden is not worth the gain. Others have said that the clause is a lawyer's charter because everyone who wishes to put his affairs in order before he dies will have to obtain legal advice, and that if he does not, the issues will have to be decided in the courts afterwards. Both sides have cited the lawyers, but neither side has argued convincingly for support for lawyers. If the legislation is drafted properly—I do not join in Tory members' attacks on parliamentary draftsmen—it is possible to enact a law that protects the interests of charities and does not allow deeds of variation to be used as a tax avoidance loophole.<br><br>
The Minister said that tax can be avoided anyway and that elaborate permutations can be written into wills to avoid tax. In that case, it is possible to advance a case against any tax avoidance legislation and against any attempt to block any sort of loophole. Perhaps, on mature reflection, the Financial Secretary and the Government's Back Benchers will not press those arguments.<br><br>
I took greater comfort from the Financial Secretary's promise to consider the issues further. I took him to mean that he would consider, in particular, the tax avoidance issue. I hope that he will seriously consider the measure again rather than merely suggest further consideration and erect a smokescreen behind which to retreat—because, let there be no mistake, retreating is what his action today is.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) spoke of people who have been told that they should not die without seeking professional advice, lest they be disadvantaged. We ought to pause and think about that. My theology may not be as sound as the hon. Gentleman's, but my understanding is that when a person dies, all earthly riches are shuffled off and he goes to whatever world awaits without the money that might be subject to inheritance tax and left to charities, to relatives—however distant—or, indeed, to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. If that is so, one would die with complete peace of mind. Depending on what happens to the estate, it is the person's relatives or the Chancellor of the Exchequer who might not enjoy such peace of mind.<br><br>
The purpose of inheritance tax is to ensure that relatives and other beneficiaries receive what is their due, but do not receive everything. A citizen who has had the advantages of what the state provides should, on death, contribute through the tax system to the maintenance of those many-faceted services that we all agree should be provided by the state. I cannot accept the argument that the state is an undeserving or less important beneficiary than any other beneficiary who might, or might not, have been intended to be such by the deceased.<br><br>
If a person has a heartfelt desire to leave some of his assets, when he is dead, to someone else, nothing in the world can stop him doing so. All he has to do is to make a will. It is not unreasonable to require people to make wills. The argument that people might not have foreseen that they will die, so it is unreasonable to expect them to make arrangements, does not hold water. One event that we can all foresee is death. No one lives for ever. Therefore, it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0296">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 517</span>
is not unreasonable to expect people to make arrangements for their possessions if that matters deeply to them.<br><br>
If people have not made arrangements, surely the first conclusion to draw is that it did not prey on their minds that the treatment of their possessions after death by the tax system would be too onerous. It should not be assumed that arrangements should have been put in hand, and that people would have wished such adjustments to be made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: According to the hon. Gentleman, we all recognise the fact that we will die. But we do not do that each week, nor do we make wills each week. People's circumstances can change in a way that will cause specific difficulties. For example, let us consider a person who suddenly becomes seriously ill, and whose wife is the only person who knows that he is not likely to live for more than a few weeks. If the family's circumstances suggest that the husband's estate should be re-arranged in a more tax-effective way to cater for the children, the wife may not wish to broach the subject at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. I accept that people do not die each week. We die only once. But the hon. Gentleman's argument can be extended to cover all sorts of financial arrangements. People can argue that, had they known that there would be a boom in house prices over the past year and a half, they would have sold their houses, extended their mortgages and bought larger houses. We do not accept the proposition that the tax system should be adjusted to compensate people who did not have the foresight to speculate in such a way.<br><br>
It can also be argued that, had a person known which horse would win the 3.30 at Gosforth park, he would have put money on it. Bookies do not pay out money to compensate those who would have bet on the winner had they known which horse it would be. The same logic can be applied remorselessly to the act of making arrangements to look after those who are left behind when one dies. We are not arguing that the Revenue should take all the money and that nothing should be left to the next of kin. We are discussing what will happen to the money over and above the amount of £118,000 which, for most of my constituents, is an absolute fortune. Very few of them would conceive of leaving such an amount of money after their deaths. The Exchequer should not take all of the money which is left, but only what is due to it under the tax system.<br><br>
If someone has passed away after a prolonged period of care in a National Health Service hospital without having made any arrangements for a will, it seems perfectly reasonable that his last wish might have been that some of his money should go back to the state to help to pay for the National Health Service, which had cared so greatly for him in his dying days. It is absolutely wrong to assume, when no wish has been expressed, that such a person's affairs should be altered after death, perhaps by next of kin who never visited him in his dying days but who were quick enough to turn up when some of his
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 518</span>
money was going. That is the other side of the case, and if people have a preference, they should express it. It is not right that it should always be assumed that the Chancellor and the Exchequer are undesirable beneficiaries and that distant next of kin are desirable beneficiaries.</span></p>
<p>6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is a forward-looking individual; perhaps he will advise the Committee whether he has made a will. However, is he aware that the author of the leading practitioners' book on wills, "Williams on Wills", died intestate?<br><br>
If the amendments that were being proposed were passed, that would avoid the necessity for making and remaking wills on a regular basis, with all the costs and difficulties that that involves. It is not merely a matter of foresight; there is a need for a regular review of one's affairs to take account of legislative changes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that a person who had over £118,000 to leave to his next of kin would find the regular updating of a will such an onerous obligation, that he would fail to undertake it. It does not seem to me that it would place such a dreadful obligation on people that we should allow a tax avoidance loophole to be put in place.<br><br>
As for the author of that great work on wills having died intestate, surely the hon. Gentleman will accept, by the application of his remorseless logic, that that must have been his intention. If it was, no doubt the Exchequer would have got its fair share of whatever royalties were due on his book.<br><br>
A theological point was raised by the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed, who asked whether Mrs. Beith or a Methodist retirement home was a more deserving beneficiary of the hon. Gentleman's great wealth than the Exchequer. However, that is not the point that we are making. The likelihood of something happening to the hon. Gentleman would be a completely unwelcome event if he should no longer be with us. I am referring to death, not to electoral change, although one can now foresee both events occurring with considerable certainty. However, in the event that death does away with the hon. Gentleman—I should not wish for that for the world—it is the Labour party's case that, if he has decided to leave his possessions to Mrs. Beith—we know of no reason why he should not—it is absolutely right that she should be the beneficiary. If he wishes to leave some money to a Methodist retirement home, it is absolutely right that he should be able to do that as well.<br><br>
We are not arguing that people should not be able to do such things; our argument is that if the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed should die without having made any arrangements, Mrs. Beith should get what is her due as his next of kin and the Methodist retirement home should get the benefit of any legacy that he had deliberately provided. However, if no deliberate arrangements had been put in place, the Exchequer should have its fair share of the great wealth that is left, alongside others who have a rightful and lawful claim.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0297">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 519</span>
It is not my intention or belief that a seance should be held, or that metaphysical means should be used, to contact the hon. Gentleman to discover his views on the distribution of his wealth between Methodist retirement homes, Mrs. Beith and whoever else was deemed to be dear to his heart. That would be asburd and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not support that view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the record, I must make it clear that the great wealth has yet to be accumulated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. The Liberal party is not what it was.<br><br>
Our debate has been forthright and wholehearted since the Opposition got over the initial shock of the Financial Secretary leading the defeat of his own legislation. The reason that he gave for that was the persuasive case made by his hon. Friends. I hope that I do him no disservice in drawing the Committee's attention to alternative motivation. The right hon. Gentleman's constituency is Kingston upon Thames, which is in a European constituency that includes Battersea, Epsom and Ewell, Mitcham and Morden, Putney, Surbiton and Wimbledon, which are all conservative-held seats, and one lonely outpost of Socialism, Tooting. Following the European election results London South-West is now represented by the Socialists. We won the seat and the clear implication of that is that the parliamentary constituencies will also fall to us. There is no doubt in my mind that Conservative Members, led by the Financial Secretary are trying to pander to Socialists by defeating clauses in the Bill. With customary competence, they have the right idea, but have picked on the wrong clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) is right. It will be a novel experience, but I look forward to representing a constituency within a Labour European constituency. But I somehow cannot believe that the whole of Surrey will turn uniformly red. That is the most empty threat that the hon. Gentleman has made since he offered to put up a shipbuilding candidate against me in Kingston. He did not carry out that threat.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) was almost as persuasive and eloquent as the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East. He condemned the clause so unequivocally and roundly that I began to wonder whether I was right and whether I should not change my mind again. Some of the hon. Gentleman's comments were a little exaggerated. The provision would not have hit family businesses in the way that he suggested, because such businesses are well provided for in the tax system through the relief for business assets. Nor do I subscribe as unequivocally as the hon. Gentleman to the view that people who retain assets on death should pay as little tax as possible. That is a reasonable expectation. There is a tax on property at death and the principle should be that people pay their taxes. I have made that crystal clear.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's suggestion of a cap would not be a satisfactory way of dealing with the problem
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 520</span>
that I identified because that would not answer the question of principle—whether it is right for people's affairs to be rearranged after death. A cap would not be the right way of approaching that problem.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman identified the problem of charities, as did the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East. There might have been a problem, although I think that it could have been accommodated along the lines suggested by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East.<br><br>
Those are difficult issues. As the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed said—which was echoed by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East—dying is a complicated business and a person should not die without consulting a lawyer. That reminded me of a remark attributed to Clemenceau which I read in <i>The Times</i> this morning, who said when an enemy died,
<br><blockquote><p>"I wonder what he meant by that?"</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed thinks that it is remarkable that we have dropped three clauses out of 180 in the Bill. I hope that the day will never come when we are not willing to listen to representations. That comes oddly from an hon. Member who keeps insisting on the need for consultation.<br><br>
We have listened to representations, and large chunks of the Bill were the subject of consultation before it was introduced. The legislation was the subject of consultative documents. I refer the hon. Gentleman to swathes of the Bill dealing with the Keith committee and life assurance. It is wrong to say that the measure has arrived without people's views being considered. Inevitably, there will be some matters in which one wishes to act without signalling one's intentions in advance. However, if a proposal will not work in the way that was intended, it is far better to amend it and introduce a measure that will be far more practical and sensible, as we did in the close company legislation. We have done that and I do not feel remotely apologetic about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I paid tribute to the Government for consulting on important clauses in the Bill and said that those clauses had been removed very smoothly as a result. I said that there was a distinction between the way in which the Government had treated those parts of the Bill and certain other clauses, such as clause 167 and those referring to close companies, when it would have been helpful had the Government signalled their intention to make changes, so that people would have had a reasonable opportunity to organise their affairs for the current tax year, for example.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for saying that he paid tribute to the Government, although it did not seem to be either warm or very loud. However, I am grateful that it was a tribute, which we note.<br><br>
My hon. Friend for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) repeated some of his objections to clause 167. I have already paid tribute to my hon. Friend, as only he could have taken such an abstruse, complex and narrow matter—as instruments of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0298">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 521</span>
variation on to the Jimmy Young programme. That is a remarkable achievement in popularising a difficult issue. My hon. Friend said that, alas, my statue would not be put up in Lincoln's Inn Fields saying that I was the lawyer's friend. Of course, he is right. I knew that the lawyers had been having a very hard time recently, so I thought that the clause might do a little for them.<br><br>
There were strong representations on the Green Paper, but, on the whole, I have been more motivated by the thought that we should have workable legislation that would not impose intolerable burdens on the general population who do not indulge in tax planning or the abuse of instruments of variation in the way that I described.<br><br>
Perhaps, the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East did not wholly recognise or acknowledge that point. A considerable burden would have been placed on many people who would perhaps have had to update their wills regularly. The hon. Gentleman asked why people should not update their wills. In one sense, that is a reasonable observation, but people who are getting on in years do not want to change their will every year. As the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith), pertinently pointed out, people's circumstances may change quickly. Health of relatives, a person's financial position, his perception of what his assets are worth and matching assets with commitments are all arguments for flexibility. The change might not have hit the well-advised and the well-off because they could have side-stepped it. It would have resulted in cost, inconvenience and considerable extra compliance burdens for very many people without providing any significant revenue gain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given what he considers to be reasonable reasons for having second thoughts on what appears to be a major mistake by the Government. I wonder whether anyone has been sacked for proposing the clause.</span></p>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was a mildly pathetic intervention. The reasons for the clause are defensible. I explained them at the begininning of our debate, and little has been lost by withdrawing it. However, a problem remains and we shall keep the matter under review, but it would not be desirable to enact the clause in its present form. For that reason, I advise the Committee not to proceed with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) wish to press his amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am convinced that the best way to proceed is to amend the clause so that charities are protected and then to vote that the clause stand part of the Bill. I wish to press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>

SETTING OF RATES OF INTEREST</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Dr. John Marek <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 475, in page 139, line 38, leave out sub-paragrpah (e).<br><br>
I shall be brief. The powers in the clause that shall be taken to be made by regulation or by statutory instrument seem too great. The amendment deletes paragraph (e) which says:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0299">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 523</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"provide for circumstances in which alteration of a rate of interest is or is not to take place".</p></blockquote>
That paragraph is especially sweeping. It would be acceptable to provide for the principles under which an alteration of rate of interest may be made, but, as phrased, paragraph (e) could provide for very particular circumstances. If that is so, before any such statutory instrument is passed, it should have to be subject to an affirmative order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be making slightly heavy weather of the clause, but the Committe can judge when it has heard my explanation.<br><br>
The interest rates used by the Revenue, for charging interest on late payments and paying interest on repayments, are at present set by statutory instrument. That is a somewhat cumbersome procedure, which makes it difficult to keep Revenue rates closely in line with the market.<br><br>
The clause introduces a more open procedure under which the formulae by which the rates are set will be published in a statutory instrument. That instrument has not yet been formulated, but it will be laid before the House shortly after the Bill receives Royal Assent. That will lay down the basis on which interest rates are fixed. Rate changes will then be made automatically to follow changes in market rates.<br><br>
For example, the rate of interest charged on late payments, and paid on repayments, of income tax and capital gains tax is kept in line with the cost of borrowing of an average taxpayer, using a broad average so as to be generally fair overall. At present, the rates are set according to a formula that is not published, based on base rate plus two and a half and adjusted for the tax treatment of the interest charge. The clause will enable the rate setting mechanism to be made more open by allowing the different formulae used for the various Revenue rates to be published.<br><br>
I apologise for looking rather puzzled at one point because the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) referred to the affirmative or negative procedure, with which amendments Nos. 485 and 488 deal. However, amendment No. 475 deals with the regulation making powers for the formulae by which the rates will be set. It will remove the powers that allow tolerances to be included in the formulae so that Revenue rates do not need to be adjusted whenever there is an adjustment in market rates, however small. The hon. Gentleman was worried about that. When published, the powers will allow the formulae to specify that Revenue rates will not change until market rates move by, for example, one point in total, or that rates will not be changed until the end of the month. That is the reason for the flexibility.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 524</span>
The powers do not allow discretion to be given to the Revenue about whether interest rates should be changed—any discretion will involve merely the parameters within which the rates will change. Their purpose is to allow Parliament greater flexibility in the formulae that may be used, rather than to allow the Revenue flexibility in using the formulae. As I have explained, the present interest rates are specified in a statutory instrument. That is not debated in the House, but because it is a statutory instrument, it must lie before the House for the requisite period before the interest rate adjustment can be made. That is why I described the procedure as rather cumbersome.<br><br>
The affirmative procedure is usually adopted only where it is appropriate for Parliament to scrutinise the use of the regulation making power—the regulator, for example. It is inappropriate to use the less cumbersome negative resolution procedure elsewhere. It is the usual practice to provide for such administrative regulations to be subject to the negative resolution procedure. There is nothing revolutionary or far-reaching about that, but it will make the system lighter to operate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is grateful for that explanation. The intention of the regulations is now clear. We shall examine the statutory instrument when it is laid before the House, but I am now much happier about the clause. We are concerned that people should not deliberately fail to pay their taxes simply because they feel that they could have a better rate or could use the money somewhere else instead of paying the taxes that are properly due. If this clause seeks to remedy that, I can say no more than that we shall carefully scrutinise the statutory instrument when it comes before us. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
