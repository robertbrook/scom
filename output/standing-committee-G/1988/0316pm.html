PROMOTION OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</div> <!-- title -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Acton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 101, in page 32, line 28, after "undertaking", insert "or voluntary organisation".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 102, in page 32, line 36, after "undertaking", insert "or voluntary organisation".</p>
<p>No. 155, in page 32, line 38, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) For the purpose of this section, the undertakings referred to in subsection (2)(a) above shall include any voluntary organisation, enterprise agency or similar body established for the purpose of promoting the economic development of the authority's area.".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 103, in page 34, line 23, after "undertakings", insert "and voluntary organisations".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) for the moving speech that he was about to make before we rose at One o'clock.<br><br>
I welcome the separate powers in the clause for the promotion of economic development by local authorities. Previously, it was regarded as a marginal activity, perhaps to be funded under section 137. That was unsatisfactory, and I am delighted that the Goverment are introducing these powers to fund economic development. To have the powers explicitly set out makes for clearer legislation and government.<br><br>
However, the voluntary movement has expressed anxiety about whether the clause, as drafted, enables local authorities to fund, through voluntary organisations, the activities which the Government have in mind. The key words are in lines 27 and 28 of subsection (2)(a) which refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"the setting up or expansion of any commercial, industrial or public undertaking".</p></blockquote>
Amendments Nos. 101 and 102 would simply add "or voluntary organisation" to make it clear that the partnership with the voluntary sector, on which my right hon. Friend and his colleagues are keen, can continue under the provisions in clause 25.<br><br>
The voluntary sector feels that there is confusion in that the category of public undertaking might exclude voluntary organisations because, elsewhere, section 137 defines voluntary organisations as not being "public bodies". It would be clearer if the provision referred directly to voluntary organisations
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 460</span>
in their own right, as the amendment suggests, as being eligible for funding under the power, especially as there seems to be no policy reason for not doing so.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend knows the valuable work done in many inner cities by voluntary organisations in providing training and small workshops and in encouraging first-time entrepreneurs. For example, the Ealing enterprise agency—a voluntary organisation under the dynamic leadership of Gordon Foss—has done much useful work during the past three years. The Park Royal enterprise trust in my constituency, under the chairmanship of Ansell Harris, has also done useful work in economic development and especially in training to provide skills which are in short supply in west London.<br><br>
The voluntary groups responded to Government suggestions that they should become more involved in training and activities aimed at generating employment and creating wealth to strengthen inner-city economies. They have done so and hope that clause 25 will enable them to continue their activities.<br><br>
That successful partnership approach to economic development should continue under the new power. Local authorities should not be precluded from assisting local advice and development agencies and voluntary sector bodies involved in economic development projects.<br><br>
I understand that the official advice currently being communicated is that the voluntary sector can be funded under the provisions in the Bill. My amendment would simply make that power explicit and remove any confusion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Battle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to amendment No. 155. Incidentaly, I much appreciate the notes on clauses. There is a full note on part III, and a good introduction. I give the Government credit for taking the initiative in trying to bring common sense into a clearly defined framework for local authorities and their role in economic generation.<br><br>
I speak to amendment No. 155 in the same spirit in which the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) made his contribution. The Bill should state clearly that voluntary organisations are to be included. Partnerships are not only between local authorities and the private sector; often the voluntary agencies play a helpful midwifery role, so to speak, between local government and the private sector.<br><br>
We are not starting from scratch. There are already many economic development projects that are excellent examples of partnership. The local enterprise agency movement is well known for providing support through premises, secondments and finance, as well as which are typical means of assistance. Projects undertaken with the voluntary bodies include various activities such as training, community enterprise and support. The purpose is to generate training and employment opportunities that respond to local conditions.<br><br>
I shall cite three examples from Leeds of the sort of schemes that should be supported and should be built into the principle of the Bill. The first project,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0675">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 461</span>
which is called Patchwork, is in an area where there is high unemployment on a nearby council estate. The project arose from the initiative of the churches, which contacted a local printing company that had connections with the Heidelberg printing company. It decided to convert some of its premises for a project that would provide training opportunities in printing for young people. The project was pulled together by the churches and the voluntary sector in partnership with the local authority and also with the aid of urban programme funding. It is a prime example of schemes that can be set up.</span></p>
<p><i>The Chairman's attention having been called to the fact that nine Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come ino the room and nine Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly disappointed that we were inquorate. This important subject is of keen interest to the voluntary sector, regardless of who is or is not in Committee.<br><br>
I was explaining the role of Patchwork. The scheme is typical of the excellent projects already in existence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine Patnick <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hallam)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. I note that the hon. Gentleman has hardly any support—only one Member from his own party and one from the alphabet party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order for me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that it is not a point of order, Mr. Hunt. If the debate is to degenerate into such points of order, we may not get further than the matter under discussion for the rest of the week.<br><br>
Another scheme, which is supported by the council of voluntary service in Leeds, is the Aire Street Workshops. It provides premises for start-ups in small business—precisely the sort of work that is encouraged by the Government. Indeed, in the Budget the Government made much of assistance to small business. The scheme was set up by the voluntary service agencies to serve that need.<br><br>
Schemes can often be adjusted to local conditions. Although there is talk of skill shortages, analysis of that has been taking place for some time, especially in Leeds where, for example, the textile industry has been run down for some years. More recently, there has been some pick-up, but there has also been a shortage of skilled clothing workers. The local comunity—the local Asian community—set up the Honah Kelah scheme for training people in new and up-to-date textile skills. That project has been so successful in finding people jobs after training that the industry asked for the scheme to be extended and supported. It is precisely such schemes that occupy the middle ground between the local authority and the private sector—supported by urban programme funding and sometimes by European social fund money—that should be on the face of the Bill.<br><br>
Although the notes on clauses suggest that there will be a clearly defined framework, we hope that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 462</span>
regulations will not be so restrictive that they put brackets round that framework and exclude schemes in the voluntary sector.<br><br>
It is difficult to deal with matters as they arise in the clauses. We shall discuss the restrictions on section 48 money under clause 28. It is a direct infringement because the voluntary sector may believe that the schemes will not be underpinned if they are on a project basis. It appears that section 48 will be run down, if not eliminated. It is important that voluntary projects should included in the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. John Selwyn Gummer)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) and my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) for their contributions. We have a common aim.<br><br>
I shall explain why we did not use the phraseology in the amendments. This part of the Bill relates to the end and not to the means—it states that the money is to be spent on economic development.<br><br>
I would have accepted amendment No. 101 if I were not anxious that the powers would be used to fund a voluntary organisation whose purpose is running that organisation rather than economic development. My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and the hon. Member for Leeds, West are right to say that voluntary organisations have a part to play. The inevitable result of more jobs becoming available in different parts of the country is that skill shortages may occur close to areas where there is unemployment. Voluntary bodies are important in assessing what needs to be done.<br><br>
I am happy to examine the clause again to ascertain whether there is a way in which voluntary bodies can be included, but the amendments confuse ends and means, although not improperly. If they are accepted, a local authority could decide to fund a voluntary organisation that employed many people, even though it did not achieve an economic aim because that aim was not emphasised in the Bill. My legal advice is that the amendment should not be accepted.<br><br>
I shall carefully reconsider the matter because it is not contentious. I shall try to include the common view of the Committee in a phrase that would not confuse means and ends and table an amendment on Report. With that assurance, I hope that leave will be sought to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend made a generous speech, and it is clear that we and the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) agree on policy. On the undertaking that he will consider whether "voluntary organisations" can be included in the Bill, I shall be happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the spirit of the Minister's reply. Will he table an amendment to that effect on Report?</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not believe that it will make any difference to the impact of the Bill whether we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0676">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 463</span>
do so or not. The Bill allows money to be given to voluntary organisations. I take seriously the point that some voluntary organisations, on reading the Bill, may consider that they have been not thought of in that way. I shall consider the issue and if there is a way of inserting "voluntary organisations" in the Bill, I shall do so in a way that does not have disadvantages. If that can be done, an amendment will be tabled on Report or in the other place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that basis, I shall not press amendment No. 155 at the appropriate stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg <span class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 220, in page 32, line 31, at end insert "or working".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 221, in page 32, line 37, at end insert "or working".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is to allow a local authority to promote economic development within a travel-to-work area when that is appropriate, because not everyone works and lives within the local authority boundaries.<br><br>
The Bill seeks economic development for the general benefit of everyone in the area, but as it is drafted, it will not achieve that aim. Economic development should benefit the specific area and the surrounding districts, and also be geared to those living outside the area.<br><br>
The economic welfare of an area does not depend only on people who work in it or on creating jobs for people who live close by. Sound economic development depends on a healthy commercial base and on how much industry, commerce and—in my constituency—tourism can be generated.<br><br>
Are we to take the narrow view that only firms that employ local people can benefit from an economic development package? What happens when new firms come to the area and cannot find workers locally with the necessary expertise? They need to attract what in the olden days were called key workers from other areas.<br><br>
Courtaulds is a dirty word in Durham, but I recall the time when that company opened a factory in Durham after closing one in Spennymoor. It said that the workers who lived in Spennymoor were not trained to do the work at the Durham factory, and it had to bring in key workers from other parts of the country. Would the clause cover that? I do not think so.<br><br>
If a firm has to bring in outside workers, that is probably the only way in which it can flourish. We want local people to get jobs, but we do not want firms which bring in key workers in an endeavour to flourish to be prevented from sharing in the economic development package.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 464</span>
A factory or a business, no matter where its workers come from, helps to generate the economy and well-being of the area. If a factory is opened in an area, but its workers do not come from that area, the unified business rates that it pays still benefit that area, and our amendment would allow the economic development package to cater for such circumstances. What about the company that needs a grant to keep afloat, or the factory that needs to develop? If workers do not live in the district where those firms are situated, the local authority may not be able to provide the necessary funding to keep the company afloat or allow the factory to develop. So we need to add the words "or working".<br><br>
Factories derive benefit from all their workers. It makes no difference whether their workers live outside the area or inside it. Employees who live outside the area contribute to the prosperity of the area, for instance, by spending money there. It is true also that factories that employ workers from outside the area service their premises from within the district and purchase materials there, so it would be wrong to bar such industries from economic development. If a local authority wishes to foster the economic well-being of its area, it will wish to protect the total number of jobs there, as well as offering employment to its own residents.<br><br>
Paragraph 6 of Department of the Environment circular 8/88 says that it is
<br><blockquote><p>"a non-commercial matter (and therefore illegal) for a local authority to take account of 'the area of residence of the workforce' of a firm who is competing for one of its contracts."</p></blockquote>
Should that not be equally true of a firm that is applying for assistance?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with the hon. Member for City Durham (Mr. Steinberg), but I assure him that there is no need to add the words "or working". Even if none of the firm's employees live in the area where the firm is situated, the area will still benefit if the firm prospers because it will provide jobs that could become available to local people. We see no legal reason for adding these words.<br><br>
The hon. Member for City of Durham is right to raise the issue and it is proper that we should discuss it, but I assure him that there is no reason to add the words. I am not keen on unnecessary additions, and we can think of no circumstances in which a local authority would be deterred because these words were not in the Bill.<br><br>
On that assertion, which I assure the hon. Member for City of Durham has been examined carefully, I hope that he accepts that, although we acknowledge his argument, there is no need to add these words.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case, I thank the Minister. In the light of his assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 154, in page 32, line 38, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"and (c) the provision of training measures to secure the economic development of the authority's area, including enabling persons to take up employment'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0677">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 465</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 164, in clause 26, page 33, line 28, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"except where trading is a function of or is a direct consequence of training.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments deal with training and trading. As training is such an important element in economic development strategy, it should be built into the new economic development power by being written into the Bill. To improve local growth and regeneration, it is essential to improve the skills of local people.<br><br>
The phenomenon is not new. As a member of a local authority, it is my experience that, in the past 10 years, local authorities have played a vital role in identifying gaps in training provision and in funding innovative schemes to plug them.<br><br>
I shall give a practical example. Between 1973 and 1983, my city lost 17,500 jobs in our key industries of textiles, clothing, engineering and printing. At the same time there was a shift in the economy towards services. With the reorganisation of local government and the expansion of the hospital service—a big teaching hospital opened in Leeds—17,500 service sector jobs became available. Unemployment in the city remained bang on the national average. Only when service sector jobs with the public employers began to dry up in the 1980s did unemployment take off.<br><br>
Since then, the service sector has moved in two directions. In the centre of Leeds, there has been a shift towards financial services, office work and retail food outlets which has not been reflected by a rebirth of skills in engineering, printing or, to a lesser extent, textiles or clothing, which were the staple industries of our city.<br><br>
Leeds is a series of small villages. People in Hunslet or Armley, which I represent, regard themselves as Hunslet people or Armley people, not as people who come from Leeds. The villages were usually based around key industries. As a result, in those areas, and especially in the inner-city areas, there are, to say the least, large pockets of unemployment. People did not use the travel-to-work area and go miles away to Wetherby on the other side of the city to find a job. Local employment had to develop—and it has, partly because schemes have been set up to encourage people to transform their skills and to learn new ones.<br><br>
Local authorities, in conjunction with chambers of commerce and other organisations, have played a crucial part in identifying gaps and in putting projects together. For example, the Harehills technorth project was set up to train people in the skills of new technology so that they could transfer to other industries. It was rumoured that people who had worked in the clothing industry would be equally dextrous at operating keyboards, so schemes were also set up at the Sweet street skillcentre in Hunslet to train women in the new skills.<br><br>
In the eight years of their existence they have been highly successful in placing in jobs people who have gone through them, who have contributed to the development of the city's economy as it has shifted to the new private service sector. In the context of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 466</span>
the sectoral restructuring of local economies, training becomes critical to economic development. Local authorities have tried to develop and enhance the quality of training that has been provided under Government schemes as well as responding to the needs of the local labour market. In some instances that is specific to local areas.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will say, as with other amendments, that he can, in principle, include training in the Bill here and now. He should not tell us that the amendment is badly drafted. He should accept the wording and put it in the Bill today, to ensure that the central role of training for local authorities' economic development strategies is built into the new economic functions and powers, otherwise they will have to rely upon a financially restrictive discretionary power. I note that one of the Minister's officials shakes his head vigorously at the mention of such a power. I hope that he will pass a note to the Minister, who will then assure me that that is not so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Officials must not be referred to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It must have been my imagination, Mr. Hunt. An official might pass a note to the Minister, if the circumstances allowed it, so that he could assure me that I am wrong and that training will be provided for in the Bill. The need for training is apparent to all, so perhaps it can be supported.<br><br>
Another aspect of our second amendment is trading, which is often not apparent as a function of training. It might seem surprising to hear that little businesses were being set up on the side. The TechNorth centre in Leeds and ITEC centres throughout the country have conditions and circumstances in which they could sell their training in computer technology and new technologies to third parties at commercial rates. Businesses are knocking on the doors of TechNorth asking to go on courses to receive its quality training.<br><br>
Similarly, we could encourage ITECs to sell their software development products. Why cannot we encourage them to be outward-going and be funded for that purpose? Unless training provision is included in the Bill, that may not happen.<br><br>
I can give other examples. The classic will always be the training centres of social services departments, which may wish to sell products made during training or in sheltered workshops such as garden sheds, window frames, garden furniture or even plants or burglar alarms. The departments ought to be able to trade products that were made during training.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will say that there is no reason why, within the present provisions for economic development, both trading and training provisions cannot be written into the Bill. The conditions of the new powers are plain to everyone.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have found much of what the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) said about retraining to be true of my constituency. One of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0678">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 467</span>
biggest issues, even in areas of high employment such as my constituency, is the speed with which the nature of jobs changes and the fact that those who are unemployed, even for short periods, need to retrain between-times to go into new employment. That is equally true of the fast-changing economies of Felixstowe and other places as it is of the hon. Gentleman's constituency.<br><br>
I know the hon. Gentleman's constituency well, having lived not far away behind the New Vilna synagogue. I ran a business at East Ardsley and the people there—not very far away—had no connection with life behind the New Vilna synagogue. There was a huge difference, even in that short distance.<br><br>
There is nothing in the Bill to restrict spending money on training in the circumstances of which the hon. Gentleman speaks. We are having discussions with local authorities about how best to draw up the regulations, and I hope that I can explain why there are one or two problems in meeting the concerns of local authorities. Local authorities that are also education authorities will want to use the training in certain circumstances, and difficulties may arise when another authority which is not an education authority does exactly the same things in exactly the same circumstances.<br><br>
There is another problem in that local authorities which already provide training will want to continue their current training under this regulation, and not under a more restrictive regulation. I have in mind the local authority that funds an open access course for ethnic minority groups, or the one that arranges for the provision of training in skills that are needed in the area. That is exactly what the hon. Member for Leeds, West had in mind. I can assure him that it is already provided for in the Bill, and I do not want to narrow it by adding words about training. As he knows, I have taken a personal interest in economic development, and I want it to be as broad as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I give way to the hon. Gentleman may I assure him that it is all here. All that we need to discuss with local authorities is how best to draw up the regulations, and we shall listen carefully to what they suggest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may have misunderstood the Minister's very helpful reply. First, is he saying that the provision will be spelt out in regulations? Secondly, why will authorities not have to rely on a financially-restrictive discretionary power?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The regulations will make it clear that training is part of the necessary economic activity, but there will be different ways of expressing it for different authorities, because of their other activities. It is obvious, for example, that an education authority is different from a district council with no such responsibilities. We do not want to have two authorities competing in that sense, and we are discussing with local authorities how best to avoid that. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that all that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 468</span>
he said would be beneficial can be and will be done under the regulations.<br><br>
Subsection (1) gives the local authorities the power to take any steps that they think appropriate—that covers training—and the regulations will set out how best to provide for that.<br><br>
Happily, the hon. Member for Leeds, West and I will not fall out on the subject of trading, either. Our views differ in the wider sense. I happen to believe that trading is not an activity in which local authorities should be involved—he is much more in favour of local authorities being involved in trading. But on this issue we are as one. It would be wholly inappropriate, in running a course on bakery on which the people being trained actually bake bread, to junk the bread because that would be trading. The regulations will enable local authorities engaging in the activities that the hon. Gentleman described to trade properly and sensibly, and we are discussing how best to draw up those regulations in a way that will be convenient for them and draw the natural distinction between trading per se and trading that arises from sensible training schemes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being so helpful that I almost wish to swallow my earlier words, but I shall be cautious on the ground that this is real politics.<br><br>
Will the Minister clarify the issue? Is he saying that in his terms—I understand his attitude to training—there will not be a more restrictive set of criteria than is generally accepted now to be within the remit of local authorities? The scope that he described is tight as local authorities cannot undertake activities that are not related to their normal functions. Will the Minister confirm that activities associated with sheltered industries will fall within the categories to which he referred? Unless he contradicts me I shall take it that they will, which is fine as they are an important issue.<br><br>
Equally, some activities are ancillary to an authority's generally accepted functions in undertaking what we described earlier as its fiduciary duty. If the Minister can clarify the issue we shall have gone a long way, although we shall deal with different but related issues when we come to clause 26.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Gentleman some comfort on that front. The provision will not be more restrictive than the arrangement that he describes.<br><br>
Whatever our differences on other issues, I hope he agrees that I have taken a personal lead here. I feel strongly about the matter. I want local authorities to be happy about being involved in the economic development of their areas if they feel that they can make a contribution. I am unhappy with the present system, whereby local authorities rely on a series of powers that do not always reach as far as they are pressed. I do not wish the system to be open to challenge. The purpose of the provision is to ensure that authorities have the appropriate power. It is not intended to restrict them. I want it to enable them to achieve their objectives without it being a blank cheque for them to spend on anything that they can
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0679">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 469</span>
vaguely call beneficial, which would not be in keeping with the rest of the scheme.<br><br>
In general there is nothing to divide us. I imagine that our purpose in discussing the amendments will not be difficult to achieve. We seek to ensure that trading that reasonably results from training will be available. We do not wish the provision to enable a local authority to buy and run a chain of betting shops. My example is extreme and I seek only to define the line in between.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The spirit of the Minister's reply is helpful, but I am less happy with it than I was with his previous replies.<br><br>
The Minister may find that the education powers are more narrow than those that he presented to the Committee. I know that you will rule me out of order if I go down that road, Mr. Hunt, but, in addition to being narrow, the education powers do not by any manner of means cover all local authorities. There are district and parish councils and London boroughs, some of which will fall outside the scope of the education powers.<br><br>
The Minister said that he was discussing with local authorities how best to draw up an arrangement, but the Committee will remain in some difficulty unitl the regulations are debated. Sometimes Ministers lull us into cosiness by saying, "Don't worry. Leave it to me and I will introduce in regulations a compromise that we are all happy with."<br><br>
The difficulty is that the regluations are never put to the Committee. Later we shall discuss whether they even come before Parliament. They might not be affirmative regulations. The Minister is slipping into the habit of some of his colleagues on other Committees. They say, "Trust me and all will be well." I am somewhat reluctant to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine Patnick <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hallam)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have faith.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some have great faith, but some of us have little faith in the Government because we do not believe that they are God.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister is not God, just a Member of the Synod.</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not take up the hon. Gentleman's sedentary interventions, much as I should like to. As for trading, I doubt whether the Minister really meant that it is about bakeries producing and selling cakes or about betting shops. Perhaps he underestimates the value of trading in new technology. The ITECs—information technology centres—provide extremely valuable business computer applications and software that could generate an enormous amount of revenue.<br><br>
I was slightly surprised when the Minister said that he was not prepared to see local authorities engaged in trading, when those very activities could generate the revenue to keep a project going. In view of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 470</span>
Government's other policies, why does the Minister consider it necessary to restrict local authorities in this respect? That is slightly surprising.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intervene only to ask whether the example that I shall outline is the sort that my hon. Friend had in mind. Several authorities in south Yorkshire and Humberside have joined together to provide an imaginative and successful package of computer software for the education network. It is making money and is superior to anything provided from outside. Such projects are not politically controversial but does my hon. Friend agree that we should ensure that they would not fall foul of the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. If the Minister needed us to prove the point, we could cite many pertinent examples. Are the regulations to be restrictive? Does the Minister intend to place a financial limit on the trading that could take place? If so, it may well catch that very income-generating business that he says he is willing to assist. If the Minister can assure me that the regulations would not do that and that we shall see them, I shall be able to judge whether to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman. I used the bakery as an example at the opposite end of the scale from the betting shop. There are other examples. The ITECs are especially worth while. I asked the hon. Gentleman to allow me to get the regulations right in association with the local authorities. That is because several projects represent fast-moving technologies with special problems and considerations, which we should not wish to restrict. The purpose is to ensure that the regulations do not restrict. I assure the hon. Gentleman that there is no question of a financial limit. I give my absolute undertaking. Sometimes I have been on Committees and heard Ministers say, "Trust me." I am not doing that—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Convince me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not doing that, but I should be happy to do so because I feel entirely trustworthy on this occasion, as on every other occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given the uniqueness of this occasion, perhaps the Minister will tell the Committee of the other times since our proceedings commenced when he was not as confident of himself as he now is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I pre-empted the hon. and learned Gentleman's comment. I saw the glint in his eye and said, "as on every other occasion." But I do not say, "Leave it to me because we must discuss the matter and then introduce regulations." I agree with what is being sought. There is nothing between us on this, although there might be if we were talking of the more general business of trading. We could argue about that, but it does not really obtain here.<br><br>
I probably expressed myself unclearly about the education committee. My task is not to confine things
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0680">Image</span>

but to ensure that when an education authority has powers, it uses them, and when it does not have those powers it is not prevented by regulations from acting as we would wish. It should not assume unnecessary powers, neither should we be able to say that it has powers when it has not. The detailed work will be done by the regulations. I start from the same position on the amendments as the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the spirit of the Minister's reply and his assurance that he will consult local authorities and develop a way of handling training and trading. We may start from the same position but when we discuss clause 26, what starts as an open door may be quickly closed. We shall have that discussion on later amendments. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 222, in page 33, line 6, after "obligation", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"but excluding the remission of the whole or part of the non-domestic rate payable".</p></blockquote>
Clause 25 gives a specific power to local authorities to promote the economic development of their area. There is no such power at present but local authorities can use other powers, for example section 137 of the Local Government Act 1972. The introduction of a new general but circumscribed power to take economic development initiatives is welcome. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) said, it is spoilt in clauses 26 and 27, which make it a bureaucratic nightmare. We shall discuss that later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. Has the drinks interval arrived? I see that the hon. Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire) is all dressed up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Squire <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hornchurch)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that anyone from the hon. Gentleman's party would know how to order a drink.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We must return to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a serious amendment. Members of the Labour party do not wish to become involved in the frivolities of Conservative Members and members of the minority parties.<br><br>
At present, local authorities are able to grant a remission in whole or in part of the non-domestic rate or provide a rate equivalent grant. An authority might want to give such financial assistance to promote economic development. An authority can grant a remission only when hardship is proven. Clause 25(3)(f) allows the Secretary of State to limit, by regulation, the types of financial assistance available to a local authority to promote economic development. The amendment excludes from any regulation the authority's power to grant a remission of non-domestic rate.<br><br>
If the amount that an authority can budget for economic development is to be limited by clause 26,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 472</span>
it must not waste resources. Firms would have to apply for a rates remission and if subject to the overall limits, an authority would be required to reserve part of its budget for that purpose. Late switching to other heads of expenditure would not accord with plans developed under clause 27 and would be inefficient. It would be better to leave the remission of rates out of the equation.<br><br>
The economic development package in the Bill is formal. Local authorities must plan their expenditure each year. They must prophesy how they will benefit from that expenditure. In addition, the expenditure must be justified by receipts. No one would want to spend huge sums with little benefit or millions of pounds to create one or two jobs. That would be ludicrous.<br><br>
Some requests for assistance are ad hoc, coming out of the blue. Often newly set up small firms decide to go to the local authority seeking an economic package. One way that local authorities help is by offering rate relief and so on. This has been an important feature of an economic development package that local authorities have been able to offer, to small businesses especially.<br><br>
Local authorities cannot always budget or estimate precisely what they will have to spend in a financial year in such cases. Some firms will apply and the authority will not have budgeted for them. The budget cannot be sufficiently precise and clear to take that into account.<br><br>
If the rate relief provision for a local authority's planned expenditure is deleted from the Bill, there will be a little leeway for local authorities to be able to handle such cases as they arise. Rigid planning at the beginning of a financial year will give local authorities no reserves to fall back on. The amendment would allow authorities to consider ad hoc cases on merit, as they arose, without interfering with their whole overall plan.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a reasonable point. However, I am not sure that the amendment would achieve his aim. In a sense, he has brought together two concepts, one of which we shall debate on a later amendment and which relates to making plans in advance. That is one sort of problem. This amendment does not affect that.<br><br>
The effect would be the opposite of what the hon. Gentleman wishes. I agree that we should enable the local authority to remit part of the new national non-domestic rate, if it feels that that is right. That power is available to local authorities under the clause. The amendment would remove it. We want the local authority to be able to choose. The only reason the Secretary of State is mentioned is that there is one case in which we have to protect the fiduciary duty to the public on the disposal of land. In those circumstances, the Secretary of State would need the power to ensure that land was not disposed of in improper circumstances.<br><br>
The hon. Member for City of Durham and I are at one in the sense that we intend the Bill to enable the local authority to remit or cut the obligation of a small firm for reasons that it felt were consequent upon its policy of advancing the area's economic
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0681">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 473</span>
wellbeing. In the new circumstances, an authority would pay the money, as it were, because, although it was locally collected, it would be in the national pool. It would be a pity if the hon. Gentleman pressed his amendment. I am advised that it would have precisely the opposite effect to that which he wishes. We will move later to the question of the preparation of plans. It seems that the second part of the hon. Gentleman's reference in the amendment would be of value then.<br><br>
I would not include a reference to the Secretary of State were it not for the fact that I have ascertained the exact legal position for the hon. Gentleman, because I realise that it is a complicated matter. In clause 25(3)(f), the general rules against disposal of land for less than the best consideration available would still apply. This is to import the general rules so that they are not excluded from these circumstances. The rules permit disposal at less than the best consideration with the consent of the Secretary of State, or for a lease of less than seven years. That provision is reproduced in the Bill. The reference to the Secretary of State relates to that alone. The hon. Gentleman will realise what we mean.<br><br>
We have always believed that it is in the public interest that a local authority should refer to another source before it can dispose of land at a permanent, low price. It is always better to have a second opinion, but if a lease, was shorter than seven years an authority could use its own powers. It would be preferable if the hon. Member for City of Durham withdrew his amendment and we discussed the other issue on a later amendment.</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, the Minister seems to be at one with us. I congratulate him on his articulate explanation. I only hope that when we discuss the other issue he does not forget what he said. I am sure that we shall have <i>Hansard</i> in front of us to ensure that he does not. If my hon. Friends agree, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 156, in page 33, line 17, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"provided that nothing in any regulations under this section shall prevent any relevant authority from exercising powers under subsection (2)(a) or (b) above on the grounds that the area of that authority does not have assisted area or aid status, if the authority considers it appropriate to exercise those powers to facilitate any economic project identified by that authority in accordance with an economic development programme prepared by the authority for the benefit of all or part of its area.".</p></blockquote>
The "General Introductory Note" to clauses 25, 26 and 27 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government considers that financial support"</p></blockquote>
should
<br><blockquote><p>"be restricted to areas which benefit from some form of central Government priority. These areas will be detailed in regulations.".</p></blockquote>
The provision could cause serious difficulties, which is why we tabled amendment No. 156.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 474</span>
Government priority in economic development usually focuses on travel-to-work areas, assisted area status and development area status. If the Minister says that they are the areas to be detailed in the regulations, there will be grave problems. Our amendment suggests that the Bill should not confine powers of financial assitance to areas that are already subject to Government designation, such as assisted areas and travel-to-work areas, because they are not the only regions with high unemployment.<br><br>
There are several reasons why authorities need to make assistance for economic development available outside delineated areas. Designations and indices often cover wide areas and mask areas of deprivation. It may surprise some members of the Committee to know that the unemployment rate in Bridlington, Humberside is 19 per cent. although the town falls within the Bridlington and Driffield travel-to-work area, where unemployment is 4 per cent. The unemployment rate for the whole travel-to-work area is one slightly higher than the national average. The local problem in Bridlington is disguised by the official statistics. The same is true for Leeds.<br><br>
Incidentally, Conservative Members seem to have been transformed in preparation for a dinner party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. Is there a party and, if so, why have we not been invited?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know why the Minister was not invited.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the debate on the Budget, we were referred to what happened on the first-class deck of the Titanic. It seems that Conservative Members are dressing accordingly, which is perhaps appropriate on an economic debate.<br><br>
A travel-to-work area can disguise large areas of unemployment. Inner-city wards such as Hunslet, Armley and Bramley, which I represent, have very different unemployment levels from North ward and Moortown ward, with which the Minister is familiar. There can be large disparities between areas within a large metropolitan region. A travel-to-work area can disguise pockets of deprivation, yet it may be the only criterion for deciding whether powers to aid economic development should apply to that area.<br><br>
Lord Joseph, who at one time represented part of Leeds, redefined the boundaries of assisted areas. He decided that the assisted area status of south Leeds should go, and he looked to an area of Bradford that included parts of the metropolitan districts of Leeds. As a result, Pudsey, which is a better-off area of Leeds, came under Bradford's assisted area status and Hunslet, the poorest ward in the city, lost out entirely on assisted area status.<br><br>
Assisted area status may not always be an appropriate index of real need. Sometimes, economic development aid should not be limited to regions with assisted area status or to travel-to-work areas. Neither should economic development aid always be applied where the deprivation is worst. To solve the problem, aid may be needed in a neighbouring area. In a county, aid may be needed in a completely different area from that where the problem arises.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0682">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 475</span>
Many local authorities engaged in economic development are in rural areas where the population is small. When their official statistics are compared with the figures for densely populated areas in large cities, they do not highlight their economic circumstances and the need for aid in specific localities. If the use of economic powers is restricted to regions with assisted area status and travel-to-work areas, rural areas may miss out. The value of assistance to rural areas as well as to large metropolitan areas, is now widely recognised. Authorities that are miles from a recognised travel-to-work area may need the power for economic assistance and should not be denied it.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister can be as helpful in this regard as he has been so far. I urge him to go even further, and to say that he will not ask us to withdraw our amendment because he is pleased to accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will not be embarrassed if I say that, again, he has put his arguments over effectively. I agree with him. Leiston in my constituency, where the steam threshing machine was invented and first produced, is exactly the sort of area that he has in mind. It is unusual in that it is a little industrial town in the middle of the countryside. It has particular problems and the generality of unemployment figures do not apply to it.<br><br>
I agree that a place that is quite different from the area around it may not fall within any recognised categories, although it has specific problems. The town of Hunstanton has high unemployment and seasonal variations. Blackpool is another example of that. Other areas have unexpected local variations.<br><br>
The restriction to which the hon. Gentleman refers applies only to the giving of grants, loans and guarantees to businesses operating with a view to profit. There are two problems. It would be odd if a local authority could operate the clause to undermine efforts to improve employment conditions in areas with specific difficulties. A difficulty would arise, as I think the Labour party recognises, if one town, by its own internal decision on this economic power, decided to undermine favourable conditions that had been granted by the Government to a neighbouring area. That is the first problem. Local decision making must not run so contrary to the national policy to improve employment in certain difficult areas that we end up with a beggar-my-neighbour situation. I am sure that the hon. Member for Leeds, West would not be happy if that happened, for example, between Leeds and Bradford. We have to find an answer to that problem.<br><br>
We therefore propose, in general, to restrict this power to areas whose difficulties are already recognised—they may be rural development area, an area in which there is bad urban dereliction or an assisted area. Then, in the secondary legislation, we hope to maintain the flexibility necessary to deal with the problems that the hon. Member for Leeds, West described. Sometimes, as he says, the way to solve a problem in an area of high unemployment is to take action, not in that area, but next door, where there is a possibility of growth. Sometimes the best way to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 476</span>
deal with a difficult area is to admit that the difficulty is not widespread but limited because of special historical circumstance, and to realise that within an area that is reasonably successful there may be pockets that need special attention.<br><br>
We have already started our consultations with the local authority associations and, with their assistance, we shall draft the regulations so that the new power reaches the parts that the old power failed to reach. Our intention is to avoid the beggar-my-neighbour policy that undermines the general policies, but we want the regulations to have enough flexibility to cover the case that the hon. Gentleman outlined, and we shall discuss with local authorities the best way in which to achieve that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely it is wrong for the Minsiter to base his argument on the hard case. Any policies that discriminate will end up as beggar-my-neighbour policies. I am not convinced by the Minister's argument because I believe that it should be possible for financial assistance for economic development to be made by all authorities. It is not simply a matter of hard cases. For example, Ashford in Kent, in the overheated south-east, uses financial powers to relocate badly sited small businesses. That power may be increasingly needed, bearing in mind British Rail's proposed development, but there is no reason why Ashford should be penalised for doing that. We are not talking only of poor inner-city areas, but of any area that has special difficulties, and that area should have the power to respond flexibly. If I may use the phrase that is now common among Treasury Ministers, perhaps it is better to give all local authorities a level playing field in the form of this power, and thereby remove the discrimination in the Bill that would result in beggar-my-neighbour policies.<br><br>
I shall give a further example. In areas where there are economic pressures in the form of high land values it may be difficult for small low-rental businesses to get off the ground if they cannot afford to rent premises. If the Government wish to assist the development of small businesses, they should give powers to local authorities and let them judge the need in their areas. I hope that the Minister will concede to establishing equity in the country rather than making restrictive regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, would like the Minister to respond to my hon. Friend's points. In a local authority area which has a high level of employment and economic activity, the problems revolve around the environment and planning and the consequent housing problems. Those local authorities will not embark on schemes or promotions that make matters worse. Thus, there is an automatic regulator of the available powers. If that general discretionary power is not available, the Minister will have to use regulations to enable him to discriminate and decide exemptions. In Southampton, for example, the local council responded rapidly and successfully to changing circumstances at the port even though there was considerable general prosperity in Hampshire.<br><br>
Another example is that of Bassetlaw. It has nothing to do with liquorice allsorts. A journalist

from <i>The Sun</i> telephoned my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Ashton) and asked him for his comment on the takeover bid for Bassett. My hon. Friend asked the journalist why he had rung him and received the reply, "Well it says Bassetlaw and that must be Bassett's liquorice allsorts." We expect such intelligence from that newspaper.<br><br>
Rapid changes in the mining industry have created problems in Bassetlaw. If falls outside legislation that would entitle it to aid under the European Community structural funds and it may even fall outside the Minister's wide-ranging criteria. Apart from heading into an administrative nightmare, there is a commonsense factor in allowing local discretion which supports Ministers' reiteration that they believe in local autonomy. In fact, they are taking it away. While we are happy that assurances have been given, I am reminded of my grandfather's saying, "Softly, softly catch a monkey." We would prefer to be outside the cage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no intention of putting the hon. Gentleman or his hon. Friends in a cage, but there is a genuine problem. Two towns in the south of England are encouraging economic development in a way that is wholly counter to the kind of policy that the Labour party would wish us to pursue. We want to encourage opportunities in areas that have historically suffered from the problems created by dereliction and high unemployment.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) talked about equity. It is not equitable that areas which need special help and areas in which economic development is moving towards over-development should be treated as if they were on the same, level, playing field. Rather, they start off on a bumpy playing field. We want to help those who need help rather than further extend the advantages of the advantaged. Surely it is better to follow the concept of to each according to his need than for everyone, irrespective of need, to have the same powers.<br><br>
We are not restricting all the powers. It is not a question of restriction. The power to give grants, loans and guarantees to businesses is best restricted to areas where specific and real need has already been identified. If it is not restricted thus, it will undermine other policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister speaks as though he is giving financial assistance rather than the power. If we were discussing financial assistance, we might be willing to argue about to each according to his need, but we are discussing the primary power. Usually, when such power is used, it is met with money from other sources. That would obviously reflect on where the power was exercised. In principle, surely all authorities should have the right to decide whether they can use the power.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are trying to introduce an extremely widely-based system to allow local authorities to make a range of decisions and a system that will not be capped by a restriction on the money that can be spent, as happened previously. In
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 478</span>
principle, the only restriction is that such aid is best used in areas where it is most needed. That is because part of development is competitive, in the sense that development in one place might disadvantage another. For example, the local authority in place A might spend money to develop there. The local authority in place B might get Government grants to develop there.<br><br>
Local authority A then spends more money than local authority B, which must be countered in local authority B. Surely that process becomes disadvantageous to the very areas which the hon. Member for Leeds, West rightly said are most in need.<br><br>
My intention is, in effect, to strike a balance. It is not completely to exclude areas without development status, but to come closer to what the hon. Gentleman sought and to recognise that, in some places, much smaller areas have special problems. I hope that the regulations will be sufficiently flexible to take such difficulties into account.<br><br>
I understand the hon. Gentleman's argument. In a sense, it might be nice to say that the powers are universal, but they will not be used in certain areas, but how could that be done, other than by restricting the powers as we have? Generally, people accept the distinction.<br><br>
Why should it be proper, for Suffolk Coastal to be able to deal with Felixstowe? Surely that would be improper because it would be more difficult for ports in the north of England to compete with Felixstowe if public money was used to underpin a perfectly lively and effective economy.<br><br>
I much prefer to bias the use of public-money—whether local or national—to areas where it is most needed. That is a better answer to the problem. We have identified the problem. I should be unhappy with the hon. Gentleman's solution because it would lead to the kind of competition that would undermine the very areas about which he is worried. In so doing, I risk confrontation not with the hon. Gentleman's colleagues but with some of mine who, in effect, ask "Why cannot my comfortably-off, well-run local authority spend money and give grants in this way?" My response is that that would be unfair to places such as development areas, both rural and urban.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not simply that the Minister risks confrontation with his colleagues—he highlights a contradiction in the Government's policy. It rings rather hollow to me to hear the Minister say that there should be spending in some areas and not others. For the past 15 years, the M4 belt and the south-east have been developed at the expense of the north, with no Government restriction. Now, the Minister suddenly decides to move into the world of planning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a totally different comparison. The Government have been spending vast sums in the north of England. As far as I know, they have not spent a penny piece on the M4 belt, which has been developed because private people used private money to develop private industry which we have been able to tax to obtain money to spend in the north of England.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 479</span>
Contrary to what the Bishop of Liverpool said in ill-argued book, the south-east has provided the taxpayers' money that has gone into Liverpool in increasing and enormous amounts. The hon. Gentleman must not put that case, which is wholly different.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly confused. I thought that the Minister was making another speech and that I was intervening on him, although I was under the impression that the Minister had sat down and that I was replying.<br><br>
It is interesting that the Minister got so carried away on that point. I agree with him if he is now arguing that we should have planning and that we should restrict development in some parts of the country to enable—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says no, but if he does not accept the amendment, areas such as Hertsmere, which undertake relocations to encourage local development, will not have the power to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's words would be more assuring and have greater credibility if the Government did not spend £150 per head more in the south of England than they do in Yorkshire and Humberside on education, defence, public administration and health. That figure also includes spending on infrastructure works for roads, schools and hospitals. The official statistics show that there is more public expenditure per head of population in the south-east than in Yorkshire, Humberside or he northern region.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not true.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is true.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend takes us down an interesting road in response to the Minister's comments. As he says, it is not simply the case that private industry has developed the area. The extension of defence industries along the M4 belt must be borne in mind.<br><br>
It is rather late in the day for the Minister to say that he now agrees with planning arrangements for Britain to develop the whole country equitably.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. David Trippier)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what the hon. Gentleman is talking about. He does not understand the subject. Let me put in his mind the fact that there is more assistance for the midlands and the north than there is for the south-east. In the urban programme there is extra assistance over and above—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: More assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, as the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) says, there is more assistance—extra assistance—in terms of the Department of Trade and Industry. The hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 480</span>
Member for Brightside should know the number of assisted areas in Yorkshire and Humberside and especially in Sheffield. We are doing better in the argument. The hon. Gentleman has clearly forgotten that his city is one of the 57 areas in the urban programme, the vast majority of which are in the midlands and the north. Not one area in the southeast is assisted by the Department of Trade and Industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have said before that even ministerial interventions must be brief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I seem to invoke the most excitable and lengthy ministerial interventions.<br><br>
I accept that the Minister could not attend the earlier part of the debate, so he feels that he has missed out because he did not hear me explain assisted area status. He has been elsewhere launching the housing action trust event. He has so much on that he does not have time to participate fully in the debate.<br><br>
Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will reflect on the words of the Minister for Local Government, who now agrees hat we should have planning and that we should restrict powers for some local authorities and not for others in order, as the right hon. Gentleman would put it, to ensure that development takes place in some areas and not in others.<br><br>
The argument is not that financial assistance would be given by the amendment or by the Bill. The point is that the Bill offers an enabling power. Why can it not be offered to all local authorities so that they can make decisions for their areas?<br><br>
I shall give way to a brief intervention from the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that his city, which enjoys urban programme status and specifically targeted aid—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know all about the urban development programme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman does. If he is saying that the urban programme should be available to all local authorities, surely he realises hat the jam would be spread incredibly thinly.</span></p>
<p>6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How can the Minister talk about how thinly the jam of the urban programme would be spread, when for the past five years he has held the Leeds urban programme at £4.1 million, so that in effect it has been cut? The figure is a fragment of 1 per cent. of the city's budget, so it does not make such a spectacular difference.<br><br>
We are talking not about the urban programme, which is financial assistance, but about the power to provide assistance. Why cannot the Minister understand that the provision is about power, not about financial assistance? Does he not understand the Bill?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0685">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 481</span>
Why does the Minister feel it necessary to restrict the power? Let local authorities decide whether to give financial assistance. Unless the Minister accepts the amendment, they will be unable to do so. As I explained before he was able to enter the Room, some local authorities in the south-east will not have the power to relocate buildings and premises when railways go through their areas.<br><br>
I am prepared to press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 157, in page 33, line 17, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"save that no such Regulation shall prohibit or restrict a local authority from—
<ol>
<li>giving fixed term wage or salary subsidies to any commercial or industrial undertaking; or</li>
<li>making a grant for wage or salary costs to any voluntary organisation, enterprise agency or similar body established for the purpose of promoting the economic development of its area.".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The amendment would ensure that short-term wages and salary support and support for organisations involved in economic development were included in the proposed general power for economic development.<br><br>
The Government claim that local authorities should not give long-term direct subsidies to the wages and salaries that are paid by private sector firms, and I think that they intend the accompanying regulations to prevent that consequence. Several authorities, including some in Wales, give small companies incentives to enable them to recruit staff. They usually have to match their funding with, for example, funding from the European social fund to make the scheme work.<br><br>
The small firms' wages subsidiary provides a 30 per cent. wage subsidiary for a maximum of 26 weeks to small firms that take on unemployed young people under 25 years of age. Will the Minister clarify whether the government see funding for enterprise agencies and for similar development advice agencies or voluntary bodies that undertake economic development projects as long-term specific support for wages and salaries? It is important that financial support to organisations which undertake economic development is not seen in that light. Such a view would be inequitable against the background of the Minister's comments. It would be better to give direct subsidies to companies rather than insist that they make it on their own.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 482</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is closely related to amendments Nos. 154 and 155. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle), I hope that the Minister will give us an assurance.<br><br>
There are eight voluntary sector groups in Newham that come within the terms of the amendment. They are funded by the borough to a total of £438,536. I shall say something about them.<br><br>
The Newham employment and disability group is a training project for people with disabilities. Training courses in typing and computer skills are provided, using specialist equipment with a general information service. A second centre and training workshop for traditional and electrical skills has recently been opening with the support of the local authority, the London Docklands Development Corporation and inner area programmes. At the same time, the first cooperative group seeking to provide tradeable services has emerged from the National Economic Development Council.<br><br>
The One Love Community Association provides training courses for Afro-Caribbean young people. The main areas of training will be computer word processing, office and enterprise skill. Advice, counselling and job-search skills will also be developed.<br><br>
The Newham Association for the Education and Training of Women has developed a women's technology centre with extensive training in prospect in new technology, a project that is also assisted by the IAP.<br><br>
When so much benefit is set to come from these training programmes, which have been inaugurated under undefined local authority powers, this is the time to include in the Bill an explicit power to provide training.<br><br>
The Newham Co-operative Development Agency and the Newham community renewal programme have been set up—[Interruption.] I hoped that Ministers would be as fascinated by this quick trot through the good work being done by the London borough of Newham as they were about work that is being done in Leeds and other excellent areas that are under Labour control.<br><br>
Two local units of Community Economy Ltd. and the Business Innovation Centre also feature in Newham. In every case, revenue funding includes an element of financing for staff costs. Unless the voluntary sector is specifically excluded from restrictions on a local authority's ability to grant-aid the wage and salary costs of an organisation, great damage will result to the voluntary sector's contribution to economic development.<br><br>
Newham was also well advanced with a new apprenticeship scheme. Such schemes offer a three-way partnership between the council, local employers and local people who need training. The schemes have been successfully piloted in other parts of the country. The basic idea is to encourage local employers to take on new apprentices. Funding was to be made available on a matching basis by the local authority and the European social fund to assist with the cost of the apprenticeships.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0686">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 483</span>
There is an all-too-visible shortage of skills nationally in a number of important trades and crafts. This modest scheme would replace some of the apprenticeships that were decimated locally and nationally in the early 1980s.<br><br>
The London borough of Newham has done a lot of business with the London Docklands Development Corporation in entering into partnership schemes to provide jobs for local people. A significant problem in Newham, as the Minister is aware, is that there is a mismatch of skills. Many new high-technology jobs are emerging within the LDDC area but, unfortunately, they do not match the lack of skills of much of the Newham work force. That is why the organisations that I mentioned are crucial to the area. They need the benefit of amendment No. 157. I hope that the Minister will be able to give me some good news to take back to the people of Newham.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intend to be as helpful as I can to the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks), because—apart from a couple of side remarks—I agree with the argument which he has advanced. We want voluntary agencies to develop projects such as he mentioned, and we do not propose to use the powers to restrict subsidies to voluntary agencies which are supported by local authorities for their wages and salaries when the aim is economic development. The proposed restriction on wage subsidy is only for firms that are run with a view to profit.<br><br>
I want to get the regulations right, and that is why we are working closely and carefully with the local authorities. We do not take the view that local authorities should create employment by artificially subsidising wage costs. The hon. Member for Newham, North-West may wish to go further down that road than I am prepared to go, although the Labour Government came up against difficulties in doing so. However, we have no intention of stopping the support for wages and salaries in the voluntary sector that the hon. Gentleman mentioned.<br><br>
I cannot accept the amendment because it would allow a local authority to subsidise, for long periods, the wages of a firm which was making a profit and selling products, perhaps in the face of other firms in the area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister says may be correct in theory, but why would local authorities want to do that? They do not exactly have money coming out of their ears. Why would they want to carry on subsidising an employer who is making a profit? It just would not happen. In theory, it is possible; in practice, it is unbelievable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to get involved in a party-political argument, but some local authorities have supported employers who trade to make a profit, or who claim that they do so but fail to achieve that. Some employees' wages have been subsidised while others have not because of a desire to help a particular set-up, for reasons other than the promotion of economic development and very much more to do with the nature or aim of the employer or firm. All
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 484</span>
I am saying is that we do not want the power to be used for that purpose. We are quite happy, however, for a voluntary body to be helped to pay its wages and salaries to assist economic development.<br><br>
The way to get over the problem is to produce regulations that enable that to happen but do not enable a local authority, for example, to pay substantial subsidies for the wages of a firm that is in competition with other firms, merely because it happens to approve of that firm's management or mechanisms. It is better to ensure that the subsidies are used for the purpose for which they are intended, and that is economic development.<br><br>
I assure the hon. Member for Newham, North-West that, apart from our disagreement on the one matter that I mentioned, we intend to ensure that the situation that I described will continue, but with the enhancement that the power has none of the total restrictions that it had in the past. With the help of local authorities, we shall introduce regulations that will not prevent the initiatives that both the hon. Gentleman and I want, but will enable more such initiatives to take place in other areas. I hope that he will agree that, on occasion, I have been willing to commend the London borough of Newham for actions that it has taken. Some of the initiatives to which he referred are of great value, and I shall ensure that the regulations do not exclude anything of value in the voluntary sector.</span></p>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the spirit of the Minister's response, in which he said that local authorities would be consulted before taking matters further. I am sad that the Under-Secretary of State has left the Room, because he would be able to give the Minister two good examples of difficulties that will be created if the amendment is not accepted. The two schemes are funded by the Under-Secretary of State through the urban programme. One is in an action resource centre, where a person seconded from industry helps to set up small businesses. His wages are paid under the urban scheme. The Under-Secretary of State has no doubt left the Room to take decisions about the housing action trust in Leeds, and I shall probably read about it in the newspapers. If he were here, he would be able to tell the Minister about the Aire street workshops, where someone who works in a sheltered, managed workshop offers on-site advice to the occupants. That is why Aire street workshops enable more businesses in that complex to thrive and survive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am fully aware of those schemes. I shall ensure that, as far as is possible, the regulations will enable such schemes to continue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) will beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. I asked my borough to give specific examples which would apply to the amendment. While I accept the Minister's assurance, assurances butter no parsnips. It is the legislation that matters. I have investigated those organisations and I tell the Minister that, if they are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0687">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 485</span>
not included, I shall be coming to see him about each case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will send me the details, I shall look carefully at each one. Although assurances may not butter parsnips they may deliver the goods.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 158, in page 33, line 17, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(4A) No regulations shall be made under subsection (4) above prior to the carrying out of consultation by the Secretary of State with the local authority associations and such other organisations or individuals as appear to him to be concerned.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 168, in page 34, line 4, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"except that no regulations shall be made under this section before the completion of consultation by the Secretary of State with the local authority associations and such other organisations or individuals as appear to him to be concerned.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have left our trust in the Minister and now it is to be tested. The clause establishes a specific power. It gives no financial assistance, contrary to the view of the Under-Secretary of State. It establishes a power for local authorities to promote the economic development of their areas and sets out the purposes for which financial assistance may be given in that regard and defines and describes the framework for that assistance. The Minister appears to be saying that that framework will be defined in detail by regulations which will include supplemental, consequential and transitional provisions. I have heard the word transitional before in relation to housing benefit and it disappeared before the end of the transitional period during the arrangements for the abolition of the county councils.<br><br>
Those supplemental, consequential and transitional provisions which will further define the economic development activity are being left to the Secretary of State. We must therefore be absolutely sure that the Minister is prepared to consult local authority organisations.<br><br>
At a previous sitting, the Minister made a remark about my city. Ministers like to prove that they know our cities better than we do and—I make no apology for mentioning it—the Minister suggested that councillors in Leeds had reported to him how rooms were used.<br><br>
Both the Minister and the Under-Secretary have visited my city in the past few days, but it is not helpful when, say, they visit only the urban development corporation, the chamber of commerce and representatives of the Conservative group on the council, but do not meet the full council. That is not full and open consultation. Will the Minister assure us that, when he consults local authorities, he will engage in open and full consultation with all parties? He might also find it worth while to consult the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 486</span>
voluntary organisations about drawing up the regulations. I hope that the Minister will give such an undertaking.<br><br>
The amendment would ensure that, when local authority and voluntary associations or other groups appeared to the Secretary of State to have an interest in new powers, he would consult them as fully and openly as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I met part of the Leeds council simply because only about 10 days before I had met representatives of the whole council, led by the Labour party, to hear about the problems there. Therefore, it was not unreasonable to complete the picture by meeting those people. I spent less time with them than when I saw the largely Labour delegation—although others were involved. The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) should not be unhappy about my treatment of his city. I never dreamt of saying that I knew more about it than he did. But I know enough to understand what he says a little more clearly than he had spoken about Oldham, which I have not had the pleasure of visiting.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman spoke of consultation. He has put me in a difficulty. I am happy to accept the meaning of the amendments. However, if I accepted the amendments as drafted, the consultations that have already commenced will have to start all over again once the Bill is enacted. That is the effect of the amendments.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman does not have to rely on my good will. We have started the consultation process with all the local authority associations. It involves all sides—all those represented.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) is not in Committee, but I should say that the Secretary of State for Scotland will discuss with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities matters relating to Scotland. The hon. Gentleman not only has my word that we shall have discussions with voluntary organisations, we have already started such consultations and have met the National Council of Voluntary Organisations. We shall, of course, look to others who may have a special interest in some aspect of the regulations.<br><br>
There is nothing between the hon. Gentleman and me on the matter. However, I hope that he will not press the amendments. They would mean our having to recommence what we are now doing, intend to continue and hope to complete during the passage of the Bill. They would mean starting again after the Bill received Royal Assent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am encouraged by the spirit of the Minister's reply. He says that he will have such consultations and has already begun them, with the voluntary groups, too. I hope that the process will continue when drawing up the regulations and will be reflected in amendments on Report.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 159, in page 33, line 17, at end insert—

<br><blockquote><p>"(4A) No regulations referred to in subsection (4) above shall be made unless a draft has been laid before, and approved by resolution of, each House of Parliament.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 16, in page 118, line 11, after "under", insert "section 25(4)".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We should perhaps press the Minister on this amendment. The Minister called on the Committee to reject amendments requiring regulations to be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure of the House. I hope that the Minister will consider and accept as appropriate the wording of amendment No. 159. He said that it was inappropriate for regulations with no financial implications to the subject to the affirmative resolution procedure and that that is not the usual practice. Although the Bill does not cover financial assistance, it has important financial implications for economic development.<br><br>
Local authorities broadly welcome the drawing together of specific economic development powers, but there is a feeling that the regulations should be presented openly to Parliament so that the details may be discussed and we can see how our amendments may be incorporated into regulations. We would then have the opportunity to question and challenge the Minister. Sometimes, we would be satisfied that he had responded positively and in the spirit in which we tabled them, but in some cases we would beg to differ and to divide on them. Unless we are given that opportunity, the Minister is asking for a back-door power in the clause so that the matter may be left to him.<br><br>
Under clause 26, the Secretary of State may make regulations to redefine and limit the financial assistance allowed under clause 25. That assistance may include grants, loans, guarantees, indemnities, and the provision of property and services. It is important to note that in clause 25(3)(f) the Secretary of State may specify by regulation the consideration for which a local authority can provide
<br><blockquote><p>"property, services or other financial benefit".</p></blockquote>
One of the hallmarks of the Bill should be that it is open to public scrutiny of its detail. We have said this afternoon that it is not appropriate for some of our amendments to appear on the face of the Bill but that they should appear in regulations. It is incumbent on the Minister to say that those regulations will be brought before Parliament so that they may be openly and publicly discussed. Despite the spirit of warmth surrounding the provision, if the Minister will not accept our amendment, the matter will be left to the whim of the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to underline what my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) said so well. The relationship between local authorities and the business community in the promotion of economic development sometimes takes a long time to establish. In the London borough of Newham, we have had ups and downs with the London Docklands development corporation and many employers in the area, but, as I suspect the Minister knows, the borough has a good working relationship with the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 488</span>
private and voluntary sectors. The borough is the second most deprived area in England and Wales and we have many problems, but we try to find ways of resolving those, notwithstanding the great difficulties that the Government's policies often place in our way.<br><br>
The amendment is important because, if one is involved in a long process of negotiation with private sector employers, one does not wish that and any agreement to be easily disrupted by changes in local authority powers. If a local authority enters an agreement in good faith, but must then withdraw or change that agreement, that tends to spoil the relationship that often takes time to establish. If Ministers covering local government matters come across something that shocks them—or perhaps the lady in No. 10 Downing street, who demands that something be done—they do not react by dealing with the specific problem that caused the local aggravation. We find that all local authorities are caught up in the matter.<br><br>
The amendment would protect arrangements that local authorities have entered into in good faith and would give Parliament an opportunity to assess whether the changes that Ministers propose are justified. Hon. Members could state what impact on their constituencies such changes in the regulations would have, and that would give us a measure of control over arbitrary ministerial action.</span></p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an amicable discussion of a number of issues and I shall deal with the comments of the hon. Members for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) and for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks). The hon. Member for Newham, North-West spoke in his customary charming way but, of course, I exclude from that praise the knee-jerk paragraph in the middle of his speech. We realise that he drops such paragraphs into his speeches from time to time in case people forget his antipathy to my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. However, I leave that matter aside and shall refer only to the remainder of his comments.<br><br>
It is untrue to say that something could be slid in by placing the regulations before the House under the negative rather than the affirmative procedure. After all, any regulation which the Opposition consider is important can be prayed against. It would then have to be discussed, and the position would be similar to the affirmative resolution procedure. It means that the matter must be regarded as being sufficiently important to require discussion.<br><br>
My decision was not arbitrary, because it is a very important matter. I will happily discuss any of the regulations and hope that they will gain wide support. But I refer the hon. Gentleman to the report of the Joint Committee on Delegated Legislation, which clearly recommended what the House should look for. It recommended that the affirmative procedure is normally appropriate for powers substantially affecting provisions of Acts of Parliament—for example, powers to impose or increase taxation or other financial burdens on the subject or to raise statutory limits on the amounts which may be

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 489</span>
borrowed by or lent or granted to public bodies; or other powers involving considerations of special importance, such as those creating new varieties of criminal offence of a serious nature.<br><br>
I have laid great emphasis on the regulations, but however important they are it is clear that they do not come into the categories produced by the report—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. I am trying to follow the Minister, but there is a lot of conversation in the Committee. If the hon. Members for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick) and for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) wish to become PPSs they should not speak while the Minister is talking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is important for conversations to be moderated for the benefit not only of other hon. Members and the Chair but of the <i>Hansard</i> reporters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. I thank the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) and I understand that he will speak to his friend, Councillor Jones. I have no more wish to be a PPS than the unpaid Opposition Back Bench Whip has to be a Whip.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member's ambitions are a matter of indifference to the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell us whether the urban development corporation regulations were dealt with by affirmative resolution?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have to tell the hon. Gentleman that I do not know the answer. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I understand from my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Mr. Trippier), that they were.<br><br>
The regulations that we are discussing do not come into the categories put forward in the report of the Joint Committee. When I considered the regulations, I examined them carefully and it seemed to me that it would be improper to deal with them in that form.<br><br>
I see no reason why the regulations should not be discussed as that could provide a model of the way in which we can co-operate, and I believe that many approving comments will be made about them by hon. Members from all parts of the House. In those circumstances, there is no reason to slide anything in. I felt that the hon. Member for Leeds, West had slightly over-egged his pudding when he suggested that it was an underhand way of proceeding.<br><br>
Any of the regulations can be discussed in the House of Commons if the Opposition so wish. The only difference is that it is for the Opposition—and for my hon. Friends if they wish—to decide whether they want to discuss them. It would be better for the hon. Member for Leeds, West to examine the regulations and decide which should be discussed, instead of our having automatically to discuss them all, regardless of whether that is sensible. I look forward to discussing the regulations that the hon. Gentleman wishes to discuss, but I hope that, as we
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 490</span>
are consulting widely we shall not incur his wrath and that he may find that the regulations do not need to be discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find it surprising that this part of the legislation will be one of the cornerstones of local government's financial relationship with the community. I was interested to note that the Minister did not know that, when the urban development corporations were set up, it was considered necessary for their powers of assistance—which included grants, loans guarantees, indemnities and provision of property and services, exactly as with these powers—to be subject to an affirmative resolution of the House. Why is that inappropriate in this case? Almost exactly the same powers are given to local authorities. There seems to be a discrepancy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can answer the hon. Gentleman and I am sorry that I was unable to do so immediately. There is a technical reason. The UDC orders were made subject to an affirmative resolution because the Lords' hybrid order procedure would apply and that would give petitioners an opportunity to be heard. That situation does not arise in this case. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will acquit me of not having done my homework satisfactorily as I did not know that until I received advice from my official.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am incredible impressed by the Minister's brief. I have not been a Member of Parliament as long as the Minister, but I expected him to know that, even though I did not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not entirely right. I have been on Yorkshire television, speaking about the HAT in Leeds—in other words, about more money for Leeds.<br><br>
As the Minister responsible for introducing the affirmative order, I gave Leeds city council, for example, an opportunity to petition the Government by making representations to the House of Lords Select Committee. I need hardly remind the hon. Gentleman that Leeds city council chose not to do that, for which we are all extremely glad.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At least the opportunity was available, and I hope that it can be built into this legislation. The Under-Secretary of State has given me precisely the reason that I need to insist on an affirmative resolution. The Minister shakes his head.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These resolutions would not be hybrid, so the situation would not arise. The reason why, contrary to the accepted rules arising from the report of the Joint Committee, the UDC orders were made subject to affirmative resolution had nothing to do with the usual arguments about affirmative or negative resolutions. It was because of the hybridity in the House of Lords, which would not have allowed a prayer against them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the confusion about hybridity, and with the Minister's assurance that we shall have an opportunity to pray against the orders and to raise the matters on the Floor of the House, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The temperature is rising this afternoon, but as sleepiness rather than fervour is the order of the day, I should like to bring a breath of discord—as the Minister would say—into the proceedings. If what has been said this afternoon had been displayed in the actions of the Government through the Department of the Environment and the Department of Trade and Industry during the past five, six or seven years, the discord between much of local government and central government would not exist. That is true especially in areas of economic regeneration where the constructive partnership that has developed between local authorities and the private sector has so often been undermined by the actions of Government—not only legislative or financial actions but direct exclusion from meetings.<br><br>
Ministers must understand why much of local government and the private sector are worried about clauses 26 and 27, which undermine, or could undermine the provisions in clause 25. In other words, what is given with one hand is taken away with the other. On the basis of that discord, we must ask a number of questions about the powers that already exist in local authorities and how they may be threatened under clause 26. Such powers include section 111 of the Local Government Act 1972, which deals with the borrowing of lending of money and transactions relating to land and property, which are also included in the Land Compensation Act 1963, and provisions under section 120 of the 1972 Act which again relate to property and land. They are important parts of the partnership between the public and private sectors in economic regeneration. Sections 142, 144 and 145 of the 1972 Act all have a bearing on the implementation of clause 25, but under clause 26 we are in real danger of taking away useful powers which I have heard no one suggest are being abused by local authorities.<br><br>
What is the intention behind the removal of the economic development and regeneration powers under section 137 of the 1972 Act, which were used in conjunction with the other regulations and powers that I have described? If the intention through regulation is to remove any of those powers and other similar powers, not only we but those who are trying to contribute to the economic regeneration of their areas would find that unacceptable.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 492</span>
I was pleased to hear the Minister say that he had taken a particular interest in the clauses and was interested in the economic regeneration work that is taking place because I share his interest. I have been involved in economic development functions and the fullest use of powers since 1980, when I first became leader of Sheffield city council. Much of what has occurred—in fact, every major event in the economic regeneration and increased prosperity of Sheffield and the replacement of old industries by new initiatives—commenced in the years between 1980 and 1987. Many of us are very proud of the initiatives. We are proud that some of them are beginning to come to fruition despite the way in which the soil was eroded and the desert started to emerge where previously there had been an oasis, if I might use those terms—they are not unwarranted because Sheffield did not face the sort of recession that had previously been faced by similar industrial areas. Accordingly, there is considerable interest, concern and knowledge about the way in which powers have been used.<br><br>
I would not want the Department of the Environment and the Department of Trade and Industry to find themselves in conflict over the way in which powers that were welcomed by one Department were withdrawn by another. I say that because two years ago there was clear evidence of conflict between the two Departments over the attitude to local government.<br><br>
What worries many of us is the use of power under regulation. That relates to the next group of amendments, but it is relevant to the group that we are now discussing. It is an almost unprecedented piece of legislation that will empower a Minister to do whatever he likes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Lest we should confuse the issue, I should tell the Committee that an investment of £2 billion of work is taking place in Sheffield, some of which is Government inspired. I accept the input that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) had as leader of the council, but the private and public sectors came together and decided that instead of fighting each other, they should work together.</span></p>
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fully accept that. It was in that spirit that we examined the powers that existed. It was not a matter of the financial limits under section 137 of the 1972 Act. We sought to use imaginatively the enactments that enabled local authorities to have a genuine role in the economic regeneration and the wealth creation process on which other provisions and services depended.<br><br>
There is no disagreement about that. Clause 26 and the amendments refer to the danger that the appearance will be replaced by a different reality. We shall have appeared to have enhanced the position for the use of powers for joint partnership ventures while disabling the local authority from participation by withdrawing the powers on which it relies. I have named the powers that relate to land and property, financial arrangements with the private sector, and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0691">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 493</span>
even those relating to entertainment and promotional activities. I am referring not to those that we debated under clause 25, when one area competes with another, but to the genuine ability of authorities to come together with chambers of commerce, trade, local industry and the banking sector to set up joint promotional forums, or to work together imaginatively on art, culture and entertainment.<br><br>
I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify exactly what is intended under clause 26, which refers to the withdrawal of existing powers while a general power has been provided under clause 25.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr Blunkett) knows about the article that features Norman Adsetts and Councillors Helen Jackson and Clive Betts in <i>Intercity</i> rail magazine, which I had the opportunity to read on my visit to Bradford yesterday. It would appear that the contribution of the hon. Member for Brightside on economic development is a little partial. I know that when the hon. Gentleman was leader of Sheffield council he tried to put some packages together, but it seemed to be only in the twilight zone of his leadership term. When he was succeeded by Councillor Clive Betts, for whom I have a high regard, the partnership between the private and public sectors came together. Norman Adsetts says that in the magazine article.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Brightside knows that the largest package of £50 million was made available by the Department of the Environment to the Urban Development Corporation. I pay respect to the city council and many of its Labour members for choosing to work in partnership with the UDC, and I was happy to appoint some of them to its board. It is true that we have the finest form of partnership in Sheffield between local government, central Government and the private sector, with the private sector in the lead.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That last phrase was an interesting give away. It shows that the Government believe that someone has to take the lead, and, if the Minister sees matters that way, it shows the ideological nature of the Bill. It is not merely an exercise in tidying up.<br><br>
We are not here to debate events in Sheffield, but I wish to ask the Minister whether the proposals being implemented through the urban development corporation were the result of the Coopers and Lybrand study and the lower Don valley survey, which was undertaken in 1986 and accepted as a blueprint. Will he also tell us whether every single major event taking place in the lower Don valley, including the £2 billion to which the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick) referred, commenced in 1985–86? It is a pity that the current president of the chamber of commerce in Sheffield did not take office until 1988.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give one example which confirms that the hon. Gentleman cannot be right about every major development. The hon. Gentleman will recall that he and I attended the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 494</span>
same function to launch officially the Meadowhall development. That development would not have got off the ground without the partnership to which I referred. The city council gave planning permission for it and the Government made a contribution through the urban development grant to ensure that it went ahead. I was as closely connected with that development as the hon. Gentleman. However, the private sector was still in the lead.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not dispute that, and it does not contradict what I said. Planning consent was given in July 1986 for what is a major scheme taking place in my constituency. It is close to my heart and it was consequent upon an all-party delegation looking at similar developments elsewhere, which was led by the then deputy leader of the council, Alan Billings. It was he who was primarily responsible for the development of a real partnership in Sheffield, not me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for confirming that others were also involved. I acknowledge that he did not make any points other than that.<br><br>
There is an ideological difference between members of the Committee on the matter. Conservative Members prefer to have the private sector in the lead simply because it knows a darn sight more about economic development than any Government or local council ever could. That is the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did the Minister say any local government?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said any local council or the Government ever could. That is why we prefer to have the private sector in the lead. The Government should not spearhead economic development. I am not saying anything new, but it might be new to the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle), as he probably learns something every day. His hon. Friends realise that that is the ideological difference between us.<br><br>
I return to the questions of the hon. Member for Brightside. The powers under clause 25 are wide enough to cover the sections to which the hon. Gentleman referred: they are sections 111, 123, 141 and 142. If the rules under clause 25 are not the same as those under the sections, confusion will undoubtedly ensue. The provision, which the hon. Member for Brightside wants to delete, ensures that confusion will be avoided in economic development. The Opposition have failed to grasp one of the underlying principles that led to the introduction of the new power.<br><br>
Local authority economic development activity is nothing new, as the hon. Member for Brightside well knows. A number of functional powers permit it in some form of other. However, the reliance on an assortment of powers does not lend itself to maximising available resources. There is a need for a clearly defined general power so that economic development programmes can be directed for maximum benefit.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0692">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 495</span>
We propose a general power rather than a limited specific power. The new power will give individual local authorities considerable discretion in the promotion of economic development. That, however, is coupled with certain restrictions to cover inappropriate activities. Those restrictions will not frustrate important initiatives but will, instead, encourage local authorities to focus resources where they can be of most benefit to the local economy.<br><br>
There may be some schemes, promoted for example by the local authority in Sheffield—if not today, some years ago—with which I might not have agreed. Nowadays, I find difficulty in arguing with the schemes for economic development and the urban programme being put forward in Sheffield. The situation has changed considerably. I am bound to make the political point—briefly but sincerely—that I am glad to see that in this respect the local authorities are complying with our conditions and criteria rather than vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It surprises me that the Minister takes every opportunity to say that something must divide us. It becomes a stick with which to beat local authorities. I remember when we argued, before the Minister's time, that the urban programme should be used to fund small units. That view was resisted by the Government then, but I know that now it is a hallmark of the urban programme. Sometimes initiatives at a local level become part of the Government's policy. Might not the Minister recognise that sometimes?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are now on difficult territory. It is your decision, not mine, Mr. Hunt, whether we are in order. We are still talking of economic activity. I find it difficult to stomach the suggestion that Leeds, controlled by the Socialists, would have at any time been in the forefront of promoting small firms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Check the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be happy to do that. If I could save myself a bit of time from appearing on Yorkshire Television and talking of the good things that we are bringing to Leeds, I should have a chance to read about what happened before my time. No Government have developed and strengthened the small firms sector more than we have since 1979. I refer to past Tory Governments as well as to Labour ones. I know a bit about the subject, as I was the Minister with responsibility for small firms for four and a half years.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman must know that I am happy to work with Leeds, or Sheffield, or any other of the 57 programme authorities in economic development within the urban programme. Only two months ago I sent a letter to all the leaders—most of them Labour—to say that I wanted 50 per cent. of the urban programme spent on economic development because that creates wealth and work, and work means jobs, which are what those areas need.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In dismissing the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle), the Minister gave the game away. Much of what has
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 496</span>
been achieved has been by imaginative use of powers. It has been done through enterprise and the use of initiative; it has been done by stretching what was already going on into new areas. One or two of the schemes would have been irritating to the Minister, and one or two he would not have wished to see. Were the boot on the other foot, a Labour Government might be irritated by what a Conservative authority did. It is only by accepting diversity and following a pluralistic approach that enterprise and initiative have been introduced. What is good for the private sector is clearly good for the public sector. We believe in a public enterprise culture as an important part of the future development of services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that half the problems of the lower Don valley were there to be cured by this public enterprise culture to which he kept on referring to—or did the deterioration take place in the years of Socialism minus one?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman will find that the 47,000 jobs that disappeared from the steel and associated engineering industries did so between 1977 and 1985. That was an eight-year period, and six of those years were under the Conservatives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I give way to the hon. Gentleman again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not having a wide-ranging debate on that question now. This is a reasonably narrow amendment. I hope that we can stick to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not give examples of what would not be possible under existing powers, which would be restricted by what the Minister rightly called the tighter general power in clause 25. This is crucial because if the powers allotted to local authorities under clause 25 are so restrictive that they knock out the powers in Sections 111 to 145 of the Local Government Act 1972 and in the local government miscellaneous legislation of 1970 and the Land Compensation Act 1963, then, far from going a step forward and making matters logical and intelligent, we shall be taking a step backwards. That is the difference between us on clause 26. This is not an esoteric argument. It centres on whether local authorities are to be offered a plate of goodies almost so good that they warrant us having dinner jackets and smoking jackets with us this evening, or whether we have our hands tied behind our backs so that we cannot pick up knives and forks to eat. This is what the clause is about. As I am unlikely to eat until about 10.30 pm, these things matter to me.</span></p>
<p>7 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Shall I go for a sandwich?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 497</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Hunt.<br><br>
The Minister has not answered us. He merely said that the general power replaces a wider power that might have given people the opportunity of doing things with which he disagreed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understood that prior to my return to the Committee—presumably the hon. Gentleman was in the Room when I was not—hon. Members had debated the powers in clause 25 at some length. The hon. Gentleman will remember that I said that if the rules in clause 25 are not the same as those in clause 26, confusion will ensue. That is the specific answer to the hon. Gentleman's question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 25, when taken alone, is nowhere near as dangerous as when it is combined with clause 26. In fact, it would be welcome were it not for clause 26. Clause 26 disables clause 25, which is why we are having this debate. I shall not rise to the bait about how often I have been in Committee. If the hours are totted up, they will be seen to be as many as the Minister has put in. There have been enough little jibes and I shall restrain myself from having a go at the Minister in future.<br><br>
I call on the Minister to say whether he feels that there is room for a genuine open discussion about whether certain powers that may be deleted are not in the best interests of what he wants in making clause 25 work, irrespective of what we want.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There could be circumstances in which, if I catch your eye, Mr. Hunt, I may speak about the fact that powers such as those in the Education Reform Act 1988 would not be sufficient to enable the putting together of this and that power, and that it would be more difficult to initiate activities if the powers in the Employment and Training Act 1981 were more restrictive than the powers in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is because whenever we have sought new initiatives and responded to new circumstances we have had to ask officers in local authorities to examine the powers that are available to them. With their imagination and helpfulness, we have been able to ascertain the intentions of those who have come before us. Often they used powers in a way that encouraged the Government to respond.<br><br>
Much of what happened in the 1920s and 1930s in response to changing economic circumstances was due to the initiative of local government officers and councillors in responding to their community circumstances. We are grateful to them today. In that spirit, we are worried about impositions and restrictions of clauses 26 and 27.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister for Local Government, who is not present in Committee, said earlier that authorities could use their education powers to further economic development. They could, for example, undertake vocational training. But do sufficient controls already exist for projects that will be subject to the general reserve power under clause 26? The Under-Secretary was not present when we discussed examples, so I shall give another to be more explicit.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 498</span>
There is a voluntary project called Patchwork, which is funded by training schemes. When we discussed skill shortages it became apparent that the proposals under education and training legislation did not identify the clothing industry as an area of need. The Leeds chamber of commerce, city council and community agreed on that. If the powers under education provision become more restrictive, if the clause is not amended, what will happen when other powers are used to further economic development? Other controls may have to be added to existing powers. The Minister has not made clear how the interaction will work. The clause could restrict already restrictive powers in other legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to do a Brian Walden on the hon. Gentleman, but if I understood him correctly, he is talking about an education provision that would be the responsibility of the local authority and of the Department of Education and Science, or some training or vocational initiative. Did the hon. Gentleman say that Patchwork provided training to make up the skills mismatch within the clothing industry?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Minister for not making the project clear. It is a printing project to retrain people who previously worked in the clothing industry. It is—[<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick) may consider it irrelevant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was found that the employment training provisions were not sufficient and could not be used as part of the project. Accordingly, it was feared that the project would have to end because places could not be taken on ET. Other powers had to be found. The powers in clause 26 are precisely those that would open up such projects and get them out of difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall consider seriously the hon. Gentleman's example. It may be a good one that should be replicated with other authorities. However, my immediate response is that difficulties will not arise under general economic powers.<br><br>
We decided within the Department of the Environment three or four years ago to put training within the economic provision that we would like to see through something like the urban programme. I use that example because I know that the hon. Gentleman is familiar with the concept. Training is an economic power and there is, therefore, no conflict. General economic powers already exist within local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The confusion arises because I was assured earlier that I did not need to press an amendment to include training in the Bill. I was told that the powers that I sought existed already in education legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it is necessary, the powers in education legislation can be supplemented by the

powers under clause 25. The only restrictions that are necessary are those to prevent the inappropriate activities that we outlined in announcing our proposals in December 1988. I am familiar with the training that is supported by local authorities in different parts of the country, and I see no difficulty in the example that the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) gave.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a difficulty with ET.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Presumably that was a move from the community programme to ET. Any debate on that subject would continue for a long time, and I should have to consider the matter carefully. As the hon. Gentleman knows, my Department is not the sponsoring Department for the employment programmes. If, however, I can help in my capacity within the Department of the Environment as Minister with responsibility for inner cities, I shall be happy to do so.</span></p>
