	<div class='title'>DISQUALIFICATION AND POLITICAL RESTRICTION OF CERTAIN OFFICERS AND STAFF</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [23 February]:</i> No. 3, in page 2, line 9, leave out "or remaining".—(	<i>Mr Soley.</i>)</p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tottenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee unduly, but I am worried about what will happen to people who remain as councillors. The Bill will be tremendously unfair to many people who have given good and valuable service to the community for many years. I know of people who have given up jobs to become councillors—they decided many years ago to work part time in local government to be able to concentrate on a local government political career. The Bill will be detrimental to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people who work in local government have been refused opportunities of promotion. It is well known in local government circles that a councillor may not be promoted within his local authority area because of present arrangements. Some have been penalised for being councillors in other authorities because of a sort of unwritten rule that promotion is not given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present situation is also unfair to the community. The Bill will disfranchise people who have given valuable service for years. When people decided to become councillors, they did so in the full knowledge that they would be able to work in local authorities. It is extremely unfair of the Government to step in now to cut that possibility off. It is similar to the Government deciding to end tax relief on mortgage interest payments. People have made financial decisions on the basis of their being allowed tax concessions. It would be unthinkable for the Government to abolish such relief. Our amendment would provide that councillors may remain councillors. The Minister should support and accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned about particular groups of councillors, especially those from black and ethnic minority communities, who are few. Some have jobs in local authorities precisely because local authorities have taken on board equal opportunities policies which give them the chance to become councillors. I suspect that, at a stroke, the Government will be disfranchising black and ethnic minority councillors if they take such a step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has said that people will have a clear choice between being a councillor or working for a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
council. I do not think that that is a fair choice, because it is a choice between doing a voluntary, unpaid job as a councillor and working for a council in a full-time paid job. Not many would be able to choose to become a councillor, especially these days. I do not think that there is genuine choice. The Minister is asking people to relinquish a full-time paid job that they might have held for several years and opt for being a councillor, which is a voluntary position. Admittedly allowances will be paid, but they are in no way comparable to full-time salaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister wants to give people a real choice, he should create full-time paid councillors so that people can choose whether to take that option or to be full-time council officers. It is unfair to expect ordinary working-class, poor people such as some of my constituents to give up careers in local government to accept part-time, unpaid and voluntary jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has talked a lot about impartial advice. He said that people with a high political profile should not be in positions where they have to give such advice and cited examples where an official might have his or her face in the paper. He referred to Miss Linda Bellos in Hackney, who is well known in London's political circles, and said that people who went to her might not feel that they were receiving impartial advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister's argument is taken to its logical conclusion he is saying that, for example, a Labour voter would not seek advice from a Tory Member of Parliament whose face had been in the paper. Why would a Tory voter go to a Labour Member of Parliament? Who also would have a high political profile? Everyone would know that Member's views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Irvine Patnick: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hallam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the argument that the hon. Gentleman is making although in a rather heavy manner. I am the only Conservative Member among 17 Members of Parliament for my area. People write to me seeking my advice because they say that they will not go to their Labour Members. I have to explain that they must go back to their Members of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Member of Parliament is entirely different from a councillor. Members of Parliament stand under a flag and have only one job connected with Parliament. They are not also officers in other areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is that a Member of Parliament is able to give impartial advice, regardless of his or her political complexion, and I am sure that the Minister accepts that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand what the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick) is saying. I get hundreds of letters from people in Tory-held seats and I refer them back to their relevant Members of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Members of Parliament can distinguish between their political activity and the impartial advice that they give to constituents who come to their surgeries, why cannot local councillors? Both are elected. If members of Parliament can take off their political hats and give impartial advice on any issue, so can local councillors. The Minister's argument that a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0441">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
councillor with a high political profile cannot separate political activity from impartial advice is not sound.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is impartial advice anyway? I know of legal advice in council terms and of statutory advice on planning, but in local government I have never heard the term "impartial advice". Officers have to carry out the policies of the authorities for which they work. For example, if a Labour-run authority has a strong line against racism and sexism, people will get advice along those policy lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Squire 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hornchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may not be aware that I also served in local government for several years and that I led a council in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local government officers are asked about points of information on many subjects—for example, social services—and they simply state the facts. Their replies have nothing to do with council or Government policy. I make that distinction because it would be wrong to suggest that there is no such thing as independent advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but that advice would be guided by legal or other statutory provision in social services. What worries me is that much of the advice that council officers give is about council policy. They are asked, "What is the council's housing policy?" or, "What is the council's policy on rent arrears?" That is not impartial advice; it is partial advice, as is advice about school curriculums or racism in schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I realise that the hon. Gentleman may have been led astray by interventions, but he is now going rather wide of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was merely replying to the points which were raised by the Minister and which you, Mr. Hunt, found to be in order then. The Minister was in order and all I am doing is taking up, what he said, so I do not understand why you are trying to stop me. I shall not be long, because I shall come back to this matter later. My point is that we need to differentiate between the different types of advice that are given by local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. John Gummer)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I should reply to one or two points that the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant) raised because they are important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us would not recognise the phrase, "council career". It is a voluntary operation and, as the hon. Gentleman said, it is unpaid and seen as such. Some people want to have paid councillors, but that is not the present situation, and it is not the policy of either the Government or the Opposition, although I notice that the Adam Smith Institute has suggested it. This is not the first time that I have disagreed with the Adam Smith Institute, and I dare say that it will not be the last. I do not believe that that suggestion has much to do with Adam Smith.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no question of disfranchising anyone—and not just technically—because people are able to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
exercise their vote. It is a question of deciding whether to be a voluntary councillor who is elected or to be paid as a full-time or part-time worker for a local authority. We have dealt with people who are already councillors, in the sense that they will be able to continue to the end of their council term. The question then is, as the hon. Member for Tottenham says, whether I am asking for an unfair choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several choices. I think of someone who does a job for another council and who realises that, at the end of his term as a councillor, he will either have to continue doing a council job and relinquish his elected job, or the other way round. He might seek a job in some other sphere, and it would be perfectly reasonable for him to do that. That is one reason why the period appears in the Bill. He could say, "I shall not continue with my career in local government as an officer. I want to be involved in politics so I shall seek a job elsewhere." Many people have made that choice and decided not to twin-track. He may decide to continue as a councillor because he feels that that is the right course for him, but ultimately find that he has to put his career ahead of his voluntary job. That is necessary if there is to be a distinction between the elected councillor and the officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The example that the hon. Member for Tottemham gave puts him on my side. He said that an elected councillor can behave like a Member of Parliament and represent everyone in his ward. That is what he, and we, are paid to do, but there is no doubt that he is the elected Member. He is clearly seen to be what he is and everyone knows it. He is not someone to whom people turn for impartial, administrative advice. That fundamental difference is recognised on both sides of the House. There is no argument about civil servants. No one has tabled a motion suggesting that they should be released from the restriction on their party political activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us imagine that a councillor is elected to one council and works for another, the political composition of which changes and whose officers therefore give advice to a different party. The hon. Member for Tottenham will agree that people who take advice from officers want to be sure that that advice is impartial. It is more difficult to accept that advice is impartial if an officer is voicing extremely partial views next door. The hon. Gentleman would not find it easy, if he were the leader of a Labour-controlled local authority, to inherit from the Conservative administration a chief executive who was chairman of the local Conservative party. In Wales, there is a chief executive who is chairman of the local Labour party. One cannot accept as impartial, advice that is given by someone who chases around and campaigns on behalf of a political party. Councils should expect to receive the same quality of advice, whatever their party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The weight of evidence suggests that the practice has been going on for many years. I have given examples, and there are many more. Why is the Minister
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0442">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
introducing this change now? The case could—in his view should—have been made years ago. Is it being done now because those who are twin-tracking are left-wing members of the Labour party rather than Conservatives or right-wing members of the Labour party, as in the past?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman. Twin-tracking is much more extensive today than it has ever been. The hon. Gentleman's examples did not amount to much. For example, 20 years ago, in London there were nothing like so many people twin-tracking. It was accepted that it should not be done for the reasons that I have given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tottenham said that the proposal might affect up to 50 per cent. of black and Asian councillors. I am worried if he thinks that local authorities are the only places where there are equal opportunities. My experience of running businesses suggested that most companies have tough views about equal opportunities and make sure that they are available. Those views are shared by my competitors. What the hon. Gentleman implies is not true in London, for example. Many firms here would be upset if it were suggested that they did not offer equal opportunities. Many go to enormous trouble to do so. We must fight that battle to ensure that firms that do not offer equal opportunities do. We should not suggest that, because some do not, we should allow what is, in the public eye, a manifest corruption of local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not suggest that only local authorities have equal opportunities policies. It would be crazy to say that. Firms such as Ford have good equal opportunities policies. Nevertheless, section 71 of the Race Relations Act 1976 places a duty on local authorities to pursue equal opportunities policies and to ensure equality of treatment in employment. As a result of that statutory obligation, local authorities have taken the lead and have the majority of equal opportunities policies generally. That is my main, but not my only, argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that comment, the force of which I recognise. Perhaps I may outline the other arguments. First, surely an important aspect of the role of black and Asian councillors would be to recognise their independence and impartiality which many people would prize enormously, and their inability to be in that position and to take a high or, indeed, any profile in party politics close by. Many black and Asian councillors would probably consider it necessary strongly to hold that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, would not an additional dimension be brought to council work if councillors had an outside occupation? Surely the idea behind representative government is that people from a wide variety of backgrounds take part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is true that 50 per cent. of black and Asian councillors are involved in local government as a profession, perhaps it would be better for them to have a wider range of jobs. That might be right,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
otherwise there would be a preponderance of people whose daytime and evening work are very closely connected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister and the Government were serious about broadening the base of experience, they would introduce, legislation to make it compulsory for employers to give councillors adequate time off to enable them to attend their council business. The Minister is simply using pious hopes when he says that people can do other jobs as well. People on shift work, especially manual workers in industry, stand no chance of getting time off to do council work. If the Minister were serious, he would tackle that problem and not penalise a group of people whose political outlook he does not like.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can disagree, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will at least stop suggesting that the reason for the Bill is a dislike of people's political outlooks. I have made it clear that such actions are unacceptable among Tory councillors. I even name a Tory councillor whose position, in my view, is unacceptable. The hon. Gentleman must not suggest that my arguments are made simply for party political reasons. I feel strongly about it, as a matter of principle. Moreover, the public, however they vote, feel the same way. Only those involved in the system take another view. There is no evidence to suggest that anyone outside holds the view which Opposition Members defend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to pursue the matter. The amendment has been well discussed. It is reasonable to give people a breathing space between the enactment of the Bill and the end of their elected time as a councillor, but moving beyond that would be unacceptable and undermine the principle and the basis of this part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 16, in page 2, line 36, leave out subsection (5).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 16 would omit subsection (5). Amendments Nos. 17 and 19 relate to the comparison with the Civil Service code of practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One serious aspect of the Bill is the ever-increasing use of regulations laid down by the Secretary of State. Perhaps the Minister can say whether the measure will apply to the Secretaries of State for Wales and for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been an increasing use of regulations in all local government legislation. The Minister mentioned the Adam Smith Institute, of which I know little. However I believe that Adam Smith believed in laissez faire and was not too keen on regulations. If regulations were to be laid for pollution control, I should favour that, but the increasing use of regulations that affect the most important aspect of civil liberties in the United Kingdom must cause grave concern to all who value the liberties that we have won over the centuries. It appears that no affirmative resolution of the House is required for the use of the regulations. A matter of such an importance which affects the liberties of our people ought not to be regulated by regulations laid in the House by the Secretary of State for the Environment and his more libertarian colleagues in Wales and Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another cause for concern has been the transition from the White Paper to the Bill of the Widdicombe recommendations on how regulations ought to be laid. Paragraph 6.215 of the Widdicombe report stated:
	<br><q><p>"We hope that this consensus will be reflected in the reaction to our recommendation and accordingly that it would be practicable to implement it through agreed amendment to local authorities' terms and conditions of service. This is the best approach because political activity … is not a concept readily amenable to legislation and is not the subject of legislation in the civil service context. Flexibility moreover is required, in local as it is in central government, to deal with particular cases such as special advisers appointed on a overtly political basis."</p></q>
The point must surely be that, during many months of deliberations, Widdicombe realised that it would be impracticable and dangerous to lay down in law—worse, by regulation—that such matter affected whether a person should be regarded as being in a politically restricted post.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no question but that, over the past few decades, local authorities have initiated an intricate and sophisticated method—through the Local Authorities Conditions of Service Advisory Board—of dealing with such matters. We all know about the purple book and the buff book. The purple book, which regulates conditions of service for white-collar workers, states:
	<br><q><p>"The public is entitled to demand of a local government officer conduct of the highest standard, and public confidence in this integrity would be shaken were the least suspicion to arise, however ill founded, that he could in any way be influenced by improper motives. An officer's off-duty hours are his personal concern but he should not subordinate his duty to his private interests or put himself in a position where his duty and private interests conflict."</p></q>
These conditions have been laid down for decades and have served local government well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke of corruption, and by doing so heightened the debate to an unnecessarily sensational level. The vast majority of local authorities are not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
in that category. Conservative and Labour authorities regulate themselves effectively by means of the informal and more flexible methods laid down by LACSAB and other bodies. In my view, it is wrong that the regulations should be used if the possibility exists of including the provision in the conditions of service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem is that the regulations refer to the retrospective nature of possible events. People who already hold posts which might contentiously be referred to as politically restrictive could cause tremendous problems. We have only to look at the mess that the Government created by their decision on GCHQ to realise what could happen. We are talking not of a few people but of about 70,000 people employed by local authorities who could find themselves losing their jobs if they chose not to abide by the regulations made by the Secretary of State for the Environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen if staff refuse to abide by the regulations? Will we see again throughout the country the sort of events that occurred at Cheltenham? Is that good for civil liberties and, perhaps more importantly in the context of the Bill, is it good for local government? I doubt whether it is good for either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the unlikely event that the Minister declines to accept amendment No. 16, perhaps he will consider the other two, which compare the system proposed for local authorities with the Civil Service code of conduct. The Secretary of State, the Minister and others have spoken of the comparative nature of the code and said that it could be emulated by local authorities and that it deserved their praise. None of this has happened. The restrictions in the code are nothing like as wide as those that the Minister will inflict upon 70,000 people in local government. The code does not have a statutory basis. Salary is not a bar in the code. It is extremely flexible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Civil Service code of conduct relates to the differentiation between people taking part in local and in national politics. Blanket restrictions can be imposed. A proper method of appeal is provided for and, in addition, it is seen to be fair by civil servants who have to work within it. The great difference between the two systems is that the bulk of local authority employees will see the new system as a major infringement of their liberties which is not the case with civil servants, who regard their code as a fair, proper and flexible method by which their political activities may be controlled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5) raises the problem of defining the word "political". The Government will find themselves in considerable difficulty unless they tighten the provision. In England and Wales, and in Scotland, many people stand as independents for election to local authority bodies. People who support them would, I suppose, be classed as independent supporters. Are they to be regarded as "political"? Similarly, what about a person who is a member of a controversial organisation such as the Welsh Language Society? That surely must be regarded as a political organisation, although with a small "p".

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
Would an officer of that society, which often participates in what it regards as direct action, be regarded as "political" and be covered by subsection (5)?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commission for Racial Equality is worried that, under the regulations, local government officers might be banned from serving voluntarily on community relations councils; politically restricted staff would be deprived of the opportunity to influence local policy to improve relations between persons of different racial groups; and when making appointments, including appointments to posts designed to help local authorities meet their obligations under section 71 of the Race Relations Act 1976, an authority would be unable to consider someone who wanted to continue serving on a local community relations council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will bear on many issues, including racial equality, the Welsh language and matters that are not strictly party political but controversial. Unless the Government tighten their definition of political, many more than 70,000 people will be involved. The Government should take on board the amendments and rethink the regulations. This Bill, more than any other, will deal with the basic liberties of our people. For those rights to be subject to regulations that ignore the Civil Service code of practice would be a major error on the Government's part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gary Waller 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Keighley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bradford metropolitan council may be known to many members of the Committee because it has featured in the national media several times in recent months. The former Labour leader of the council, Councillor Beeley, found that his duties as a councillor were taking up so much of the time that he owed to his job that his employer became unwilling to see him only at irregular intervals and announced to him that it would put an end to his employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Councillor Beeley obtained a position with the adjoining Wakefield authority as an officer responsible for co-ordinating the campaign against the tendering procedure. By any assessment that post would be regarded as highly political. My example shows what is so objectionable about the current practice. Councillor Beeley had a highly political role as an officer with an adjoining authority and in effect, his post was used to subsidise his leadership of the Bradford authority. I imagine that he was on a fairly loose rein in the job for which he was paid by the ratepayers of Wakefield. That is one example of why there is great public concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for allowing me to comment as a Wakefield ratepayer. It is only right that I put the record straight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Councillor Beeley was appointed to advise the council on aspects of privatisation, which is different from what the hon. Gentleman said. Furthermore, because he had important information on privatisation, it was right that Wakefield had access to it. The appointment was in line with what the authority and, indeed, many ratepayers, wished. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will advise the Committee correctly, and not mislead it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Councillor Beeley said that he saw it as part of his role to ensure that services were not privatised. He did not start with a plan of trying to obtain the best possible value for Wakefield ratepayers. On the contrary, it was not Wakefield's policy to implement a successful tendering process. Nor was it Councillor Beeley's role to help the council to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us suppose that Councillor Beeley had good arguments on which to base his advice on privatisation to Wakefield council, and that these led him to believe that privatisation of council services was a bad thing. Will my hon. Friend agree that, as the Labour leader of Bradford, it would be difficult for Councillor Beeley to convince the general public in Wakefield that his views were the result of deep study and independent mind? Would he not be much impeded in his role as an independent officer by activities in a neighbouring authority that showed him to be a highly partial political figure? Is this not a prize example of a man who might have been able to advise extremely well but who could not do so convincingly to the people of Wakefield because he was already identified with a party? Whenever he gave advice in Wakefield that was in line with policy that he was carrying out in Bradford, his advice would—no doubt, unfairly—be considered party political and not based on professional expertise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my right hon. Friend the Minister. It would be stretching the credibility of Wakefield ratepayers to expect them to believe otherwise. It was also stretching the credibility of Bradford ratepayers to expect them to think that one of their elected councillors was not being paid by ratepayers in a neighbouring authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chairman of the education committee, Councillor Ryan, also became redundant in his paid employment after a time and similarly obtained a political post with the adjoining Wakefield authority. His appointment, too, caused great concern among ratepayers in Wakefield and Bradford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Councillor Beeley is no longer leader of Bradford council but leader of the opposition. Councillor Ryan is no longer chair of the education committee but an opposition spokesman. One reason for the change is the great concern about twin-tracking and political appointments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Does the hon. Member for Keighley (Mr. Waller) agree that if there are such grave fears, and if individuals' contracts should be changed to take account of that concern, the same contractual obligation should exist in appointments to private companies of councillors in Conservative boroughs

who are active in the privatisation process? Is it appropriate that people should be paid large sums—for example, £250,000—by large retail chains to assist and advise on obtaining planning permission? Does the hon. Gentleman not consider that there is a degree of hypocrisy, unequalled even in this place, in the way in which the Government are dealing with public and private interests?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill seeks to protect ratepayers from abuse. There are laws of corruption which can be used, and have been used, when people working for other companies act improperly, but that goes wide of the point. Legislation exists and it is a matter of enforcement. I do not wish to be drawn into further discussion on that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is entirely incorrect to say that there is no public concern or that the electors should be left to judge. In this instance, the electors clearly demonstrated their judgment. One reason why the Conservative party and not the Labour party control Bradford council is that the electors were fed up with abuse and wanted it to end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 18 seeks to clarify what is meant by political activities and restrictions under subsection (5).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department of the Environment notes state that the object of the Bill is to prevent twin-tracking. If the amendments, especially those tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) and amendment No. 18, are not accepted, it will mean that the employees of local authorities will have to read the Act to decide whether the disqualifications apply to their political activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 18 provides that present or prospective local authority employees, whatever their position, would be given guidance on disqualification in their contract of employment and the terms on which they are employed would be clear from the outset. The amendment is the mechanism by which local authority employees could be sure of what is meant in the clause by disqualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the Bill is designed to prevent twin-tracking. Clause 1(5), at line 40, refers to political activities, and we want it deleted. The Minister and his hon. Friends should seriously consider why that phrase is included. We beleive that such an anomalous subsection is totally inappropriate in principle and would be abysmally inadequate in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By pursuing the legislation as drafted, the Secretary of State is showing that he is not in the real world. The existing codes of practice should be examined in detail and the subsection amended. There are significant dangers in the proposal. What is meant by political activity? Subsection (5) does not clarify what is meant by political activity, and neither do the notes on clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My anxiety was dramatically heightened by realising that political activity could be extended beyond party politics. My hon. Friend the Member
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
for Torfaen raised the matter of civil liberties and referred to a transgression that could result from the Secretary of State's interpretation of political activities. If the amendment is not accepted, his interpretation of political activities might extend to those of an officer of a local authority who does voluntary work for the Commission for Racial Equality who could be disqualified for making a Christian and human contribution to the promotion of racial equality in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much could be included in "political activity" if it were left to the Secretary of State to decide. Activities would be regarded as political because of the way in which he interprets such things. It should not be left to the Secretary of State to decide what is a political activity. Instead of regulations, there should be a contract of employment setting out a real definition and a cut-off point of political activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5) refers also to, "restricting his political activities". How will that apply to an officer of a district or county council who serves on a parish council? That happens quite often. People in the community ask people who are active in local government—who usually occupy a senior position on a neighbouring authority—to take an active part in the parish council and to guide it in the right direction. In our constituencies, we all have officers of neighbouring authorities, whether county or district, who serve on parish councils. An officer of the county or district council is usually co-opted on to the parish council or asked to be one of its members—he has not been elected, so that there is no question of being involved in political activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a reply to a question that I asked during our previous sitting, the Minister said, at c.22, that all of those people would be brought into the net because they were serving members of a council. I hope that he will clarify that remark, because they would be in addition to the 70,000 or so local authority officers who would be disqualified under subsection (5). As tens of thousands of other officers serve in parish councils, I hope that the Minister will explain exactly what is meant by, "restricting his political activities" in the subsection. Is he saying that a member of a parish council who is an officer in a neighbouring authority, but who receives no payments or allowances, including ex gratia payments or travel allowances, will be subject to the same interpretation as any other elected member?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it the responsibility of the parish council to appoint an adjudication officer to decide whether a person's political activities disqualify him from serving on that parish council? If the adjudication officer is not appointed by the parish council, who interprets the clause? We hope that the Minister will explain that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise the issue because of what the Minister said at our previous sitting in answer to my question about councillors who sit as independents. The Minister said that he knew of independent councillors who emerged in other activities in the community as Tory activitists, and he said that all elected members would be "covered", so how will people who sit on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0446">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>51</span>
parish councils be treated? Will they be banned from taking part in the politics of their communities? Will they have a right of appeal if their political activities are restricted and they are prevented from serving on that community council?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issues are not clear cut. Nowhere in the notes on clauses that we have received from the Department of the Environment—this voluminous document that has been sent to members of the Committee—is there any mention of parish councillors who are officers of a neighbouring authority. If parish councils are not involved—that is the inference that we must draw when we find no mention of them in the document—we need to be told so. We want to know, for instance, where the cut-off point is for local government. I have always accepted that parish councils and town councils are a tier of local government, and if the Bill applies to that tier, why is it not included in the notes on clauses? I hope that the Minister will tell us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of anomalies in the Bill. Unless subsection (5) is amended, how will people know about their terms of employment and the restrictions on their political activities, either when they apply for a job in local government or, following the enactment of the Bill, as existing employees? Their contracts of employment should contain that information, because such people should be treated with fairness and justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that the Minister will respond to all the issues that we have raised, answer our questions about the contract of employment, and explain the terms of employment of, and restrictions on the political activities of, local authority employees. Will he also tell us his view on political activities, such as those of officers from a county or district authority serving on a parish council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Truro)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 1(15) gives wide-ranging powers to the Secretary of state. Will the Minister tell us why he and the Government have not engaged in the kind of consultation that was recommended by Widdicombe about the establishment of such powers? It was a specific and clear recommendation. It was considered necessary because of the difficulty of defining in legislation, or in any rules, the practices that should be allowed by any local authority. To some extent, the Minister would probably accept that. He said that, because of the different gradings used by local authorities, it is difficult to define posts. Indeed, the Minister has opted for a straight financial definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister appears not to have entered into consultation in the context of subsection (5). Amendment No. 20 provides for such consultation with local authorities, but it should have occurred already rather than have to be included in the Bill for subsequent drawing up of rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers in the subsection are wide ranging. It is wrong for the Secretary of State to give himself such powers without the Committee being told more about the provision. Even if the Minister told us more about the powers that he envisages, it would be wrong to put them into the Bill in this form. I should prefer them to be written in or to be subject
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
to scrutiny by more people who can consider them in detail and be directly responsible for so doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain what he believes the political activities will be? The Commission for Racial Equality is worried about voluntary service and cited community relations councils as an example. There are many other activities where the issues tackled by voluntary bodies are clearly political, but not necessarily party political.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision does not appear to restrict simply party political activities. The extent to which that would be an unnecessary and wrong restriction can be illustrated by using the example of a school governor. Let us assume that speaking in public or publishing material on matters of political controversy should be prevented. Suppose that someone works for a local authority and is a school governor. Most of us would welcome that and consider it useful. Indeed, if anything, there is a shortage of people who are prepared to put their time and effort into such a role. It is clear that the issues which that person may have to raise, discuss and write about will fall directly within the political interest and party political controversy. An example of that is opting out, which is a subject that will certainly come before school governors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The public should know the views held by governors. Indeed, governors may have to address meetings of parents and others interested in the matter. Are we to assume that a local authority employee could not participate in such discussions and could discuss only the colour that the corridors were painted rather than what goes on in them and who takes the decisions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How would the Minister define party political activities? Does he simply believe that 70,000 or 90,000 people, or the greater number who may come under subsection (5), should be told that they must not participate in purely party political activities and that they should not canvass, hold office in party politics or publicly announce their candidacy? Is the right hon. Gentleman saying that they should not participate in any kind of community activity that involves them raising issues which the Minister or others regard as party political? We have already head the example of people serving on community or parish councils, and this is a broad and important consideration when examining the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendments Nos. 17 and 19, will the Minister explain why, in the Bill or elsewhere, he cannot produce the sort of tightly defined guidance that is contained in the Civil Service code, whose elaborate appeals provisions go far beyond anything in the Bill? The code has appeals boards that provide for trade union representation and, most importantly, for blanket exemptions. Does the Minister envisage such procedures under the Bill? There are no obvious signs of them. Without them, the backlog of appeals on whether individuals should be allowed to take part in political activity will be even longer than the backlog of appeals against the nurses' grading structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill allows appeal only on the salary bar, and there is no equivalent in the Civil Service code. Why do civil servants have an elaborate appeals procedure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0447">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>53</span>
for everyone, irrespective of whether his or her chances are high? Under the Bill only one category will have a right of appeal, which will be fairly limited compared with that in the Civil Service. A civil servant can go to an appeals board and, if his departmental head does not agree with the board's decision, he can ultimately go to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definitions in the Civil Service guidelines are infinitely more elaborate and go into the subtlety and difficulty of making distinctions. Nothing in the Minister's remarks and certainly nothing in the Bill suggests that that there will be equivalent procedures under this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not quite understand the hon. Gentleman's point about the salary bar. As I understand it, civil servants can appeal on any ground that there is no reason why they should not hold both offices because neither contradicts the other. The exception is chief officers. There is no question of appealing against a salary bar. The only distinction is that civil servants in the entirely restricted political section can technically appeal. In fact, they do not do so. I know of no case when a civil servant has appealed. If there have been such cases, I know of none that has succeeded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only posts where the restrictions are tighter than they are in the Civil Service are those of a few named senior officers, which does not connect with the argument about a salary bar. Those above the salary bar have a right to appeal on the grounds that they do not believe that they should be restricted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This question has been raised several times. The understanding among opposition parties is that the only appeal is for those on the salary bar, and that there is no appeal for those covered by clause 2(2), who fall below the salary bar but who are defined out in other ways. If not, there is a conflict with both subsection (5) and clause 2(2).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is confusing two issues. Some people are restricted by the terms of their arrangements with their local authority. There is no appeal against a local authority's decision that a job can be done only by someone in a politically restricted category. It is perfectly reasonable for an authority to decide which jobs are not compatible for its purpose with elected or non-elected office or with taking part in political activity. There is no appeal against the terms and conditions laid down by an authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who are not caught in that group and who are not chief officers but who are excluded from some activities because they earn more than the minimum salary have a right of appeal unfettered by the financial limit. They can sensibly say, "My job as a computer operator with this local authority can't possibly conflict with my becoming a candidate for another local authority." That right of appeal is sensible and broadly drawn. It would be for the adjudicator to decide whether a case was reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I understand the Minister's argument, but I am not sure whether the Bill will have the effect that he describes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2(3) rules out people on the grounds of
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>"(a) giving advice on a regular basis…</li>
	<li>(b) acting on behalf of the authority on a regular basis for communicating with journalists or broadcasters; or</li>
	<li>(c) dealing on a regular basis with members of the public".</li>
</div> <!-- ul -->
I am happy for the Minister to correct me, but I am not certain that all those people will have a right of appeal. In effect, a local authority will be obliged to rule them out. They will not be ruled out on the specific grounds of the salary bar, which is subject to appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I misunderstood the hon. Gentleman's comment, which he repeated, about the specific grounds of the salary bar which is subject to appeal. Appeals are made not on the grounds of the salary bar but on whatever grounds are advanced by the people barred at that salary level. Our disagreement may have arisen because of a misunderstanding. It is unclear what case the hon. Gentleman is making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who are not in one of two other categories can appeal to the adjudicator on whatever grounds they wish. I imagine that the usual grounds will be, "My job as crematorium manager does not make it improper for me to be a council candidate or to engage in party political activities."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be for local authorities to decide, in the light of the guidelines, to nominate posts in the excluded groups. People holding those posts have no right of appeal because their authority has decided that their jobs are not compatible with party political activity. Chief officers are in the highest category comparable with the Civil Service and do not have a right of appeal. I was showing that although civil servants have an opportunity to appeal, we could not genuinely say that it makes much difference. I know of no successful appeal. We should not pretend that a successful appeal could be made in those circumstances. It is better to be honest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I broadly accept the Minister's latter point. Although there may have been appeals they have not been successful, and I would not hang my colours on that mast. An appeal system is no bad thing because it allows for wrong decisions. I would rather see an appeal system than not, but that is not the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has confirmed my belief that people ruled out by local authorities under his guidelines will have no right of appeal. That is wrong for two reasons. First, we do not know what guidelines the Minister will use, so it is impossible for the Committee to judge how much power he will have to make definitions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also do not believe that we should put in statute a system that could bar people in general, depending on how local authorities interpret the Bill, without giving them some right of appeal. It is not good enough for the Minister to say that such a ban will be subject to the local authority when local authorities already have that power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0448">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>55</span>
We hope that local authorities will have their own appeal procedure. If the Minister wants them to draw up guidelines and ban people under guidelines that he will give, it is incumbent on the Minister to stress in the Bill that that must be done only with a proper and full appeal procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must correct the hon. Gentleman. The guidelines for this category are in the Bill. They are clear, and so are the rules under which a local authority will draw up its list. I know the hon. Gentleman's argument is about whether this should be subject to appeal, but my point is that this is in the nature of the contract between the local authority and its employees in the sense that it says that these are the people who should not twin-track. It is reasonable for an authority to say that without it being subject to any outside argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what the Minister said about the guidelines being in the Bill. I take it that he is referring to clause 2(3), but it does not tell us anything. Will the Minister leave its interpretation to the local authority, which gives it an enormously broad power? The Minister nods in agreement. It is important for the Committee to be aware that the Minister intends to give no further guidance on the interpretation of these rules. They will be laid down as A, B and C in the clause and then it will be left to local authorities to ban people from political activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is giving local authorities an extraordinary power that allows them to justify their banning almost anyone from political activity and to do so retrospectively—existing staff can be banned. They will have enormous power over people's activities. The local authority may take against somebody or disagree with particular political activities. I cannot think of anyone who cannot be restricted under the terms given here. If the local authority so wished, anyone could come within the guidelines in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister reconsider the matter? I find it hard to believe that, ultimately, the Department for the Environment will not issue guidelines. The Minister has given an appeals procedure for the salary bar; he should also ensure that everyone is protected with a proper appeals procedure. Further, that appeals procedure should not simply apply within the local authority. The Bill gives local authorities enormous potential power over far more than the 70,000 people to which we regularly refer. It enables them to rule over many people's lives and their activities, including people who are already in post with local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will elaborate on that point and reconsider his not writing in some form of appeal for that large number of people who could be affected by this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to direct my attention to political activity and the amendment about the Civil Service. To set the scene, I shall take Committee Members back to the report of our proceedings in 	<i>Hansard</i> on 23 February. The Minister said:
	<br><q><p>"If I were a parent going to either a black Fascist of the type of which I speak, or a red Fascist, I would not feel that I was getting

I agree with the Minister. I would not want to go to someone who is a National Front councillor for advice either. The Minister continues:
	<br><q><p>"I am sure that the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant) … would want to protect people from having a go to an adviser who is manifestly racially biased, any more than he would want them to receive advice from someone who was manifestly sexist in approach."</p></q>
I agree with the Minister on that point. He continued:
	<br><q><p>"First, as we are not discussing ad hominem, the truth is that there are clear rules about party political activity by members of the Civil Service."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee G,</i> 23 February 1989; c.13, 14, 18.]</p></q>
The Minister said that there were clear rules with regard to those matters. The Minister went on to mention other things along those lines. In those extracts, the Minister said three things: First, he said that it would be wrong for a National Front councillor to be seen to be giving impartial advice, and I agree with him. Secondly, the Minister said that there were clear rules about party political activity by members of political parties within the Civil Service. Thirdly, the Minister gave the example of someone whose picture was in the newspapers and said that that person should not be seen as giving impartial advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can give an example of a case that raises all three points. In the Tottenham 	<i>Weekly Herald</i> dated 1 June 1988 under the caption,
	<br><q><p>"Protest over 'fascist' DHSS worker",</p></q>
there is a picture of Mr. Paul Nash who is speaking at a National Front rally. The paper said:
	<br><q><p>"Paul Nash, pictured left, has been working in the pensions and contributions department of Tottenham DHSS office for over five years. He admitted to the Weekly Herald last week, that he is a member of the National Front. Claimants are outraged, because they say he has access to the personal details of tens of thousands of local people."</p></q>
When this matter was brought to my attention, I wrote to the former Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security—the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Portillo). On 5 July 1988 he replied:
	<br><q><p>"A person's political views, or past or present membership of a political party or any other organisation, are not a bar to employment in the Civil Service. Clearly, it is right that this should be so and you will appreciate the dangers of excluding anyone from employment on these grounds. Mr. Nash's personal views have been known to management over the last five years."</p></q>
I was not happy with that answer, so I wrote again. This time I received a reply from the current Under-Secretary of State for Social Security. He said:
	<br><q><p>"I can only repeat what was said in our letter of 5 July; members of political parties, generally or particularly, cannot be disqualified from Crown employment simply because we might have apprehensions about the implications for society of the convictions we assume that someone belonging to or associated with a political party will hold."</p></q>
In the Bill, however, the Government are saying that if a person takes part in political activities in local government he will be banned from holding office, but that does not apply in the Civil Service. Perhaps the Minister will explain why the Government are allowing racists and Fascists to work for the Civil Service and to have access to files and information

on black and other minority ethnic people. Why do the Government allow those people who have said that they are racists or Fascists to remain in the Civil Service? If someone is a Socialist, Conservative or a Liberal, the Government's new rule will prevent him from working in local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and I share the view that membership of the National Front is inappropriate. I hope that he shares my view that membership of organisations at either extreme of the political spectrum is inappropriate because they deny democracy. I wish that the hon. Gentleman would read statements made by the Socialist Workers' party. He may find them inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither the Bill nor the Civil Service rules stop people from belonging to a political party. People may still belong, the question is what constitutes political activity. Anyone employed by a local authority may take part in a political activity if he earns less than a certain amount, is not in a politically restricted role or if the section in which he works is given a general exemption by the independent adjudicator. There is no distinction. There is nothing in the Bill or the regulations that prohibits a local government officer from being a member of a political party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Portillo), formerly Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security, said in his letter that there was nothing in the Civil Service rules to stop anyone from belonging to a political party. People cannot be prevented from taking a job because of their membership of a political party. It would be wrong for me to advise the hon. Gentleman, but his point should be not about membership of a political party. It would be wrong for me to advise the hon. Gentleman, but his point should be not about membership of a political party but about the activity to which the cutting referred. If the hon. Gentleman used that argument, he would have to discover whether the man was in a politically sensitive position. If not, he should press for a wider range of politically restricted areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked about the political activity of the gentleman in question and I was given an answer about belonging to a political party. My point is that someone who confessed to being a rascist and a member of the National Front was pictured on the front page of the local paper addressing a meeting of that organisation. The Government have not found a way to deal with such a matter and yet they want to restrict people who are members of legitimate political parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that it is OK for a civil servant to be a member of the National Front and to speak on public platforms, but that is not acceptable for a local government employee to take part in a minor, undefined political activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend consider that Ministers would be as relaxed about a civil
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
servant who is a member of the Communist party addressing a rally as they appear to be about a member of the National Front addressing a meeting and then dealing with a large number of black clients? My hon. Friend may consider that the Minister would be less laid-back and complacent in that case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. At our previous sitting, the Minister said:
	<br><q><p>"I do not believe that people who go the town hall for impartial advice and find that the person sitting in front of them is manifestly a party political figure whose photograph they see in the local newspapers, and whose words they have read in the local press and heard on the radio, will believe that it is proper for that person to give them independent advice."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee G,</i> 23 February 1980; c. 18.]</p></q>
I am a simple person and I want to know why the Government will allow Mr. Paul Nash, a Fascist and a racist Member of the National Front, to hold a position in the Department of Social Security office in Tottenham, where there are many black and other ethnic minority residents, but they oppose Miss Linda Bellos, who is not a racist or a Fascist, being a member of Hackney Council. I cannot understand it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman would like the proposals to be extended so that no one working for a local authority or for national Government can take part in party-political activities, the Committee will listen to his argument. Unlike other members of the Committee, I have made it clear that I do not consider that membership of a Fascist organisation, of the Left or the Right, is an acceptable activity in any circumstances. I do not accept the suggestions that passed between the hon. Gentlemen. Some of us have had a clear public position on the subject for many years. I strongly object to any suggestion to the contrary. It may be thought funny now, but as a Young Conservative I led a boycott of pubs that would not serve black people in their saloon bars. That was in the days when such campaigning was very unpopular. The hon. Gentleman's questions are unworthy of him. They anger those of us who have suffered considerable attacks because of our position on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is prepared to speak against the National Front but not about Trotskyites. He complains that I find political activity more unacceptable for a Communist than for a member of the National Front. I find both unacceptable because they do not treat people as people but as groups. One treats them as members of a class and the other as if there is a racial difference neither of which I maintain—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know which of the last half-dozen points I am supposed to respond to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept what the Minister said. I have not impugned his credentials. I am pleased that he took action against racism in pubs. That is tremendous and I support him wholeheartedly. I do not quarrel with him on that issue. However, I do quarrel with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0450">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>59</span>
the Government and with his hon. Friend the Member for Fareham (Mr. Lloyd) who thinks that it is in order for those who hold racist views to be in regular daily contact with people and to pass on information about them to their organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that I am prepared to take action against the National Front but not against the Socialist Workers' party. I agree that I am not prepared to take action against the Socialist Workers' party because as far as I am aware, that party is completely opposed to racism, sexism and Fascism. The National Front supports racism and Fascism. To say that both are the same is disingenuous. The Minister is saying that as a fish swims and a duck swims, a fish is a duck. That is nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not find it difficult to differentiate between the National Front and the Socialist Workers' party and I am surprised that the Minister cannot draw that distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are so keen on impartial advice, they must take action against those who are seen by the public as giving advice that is not impartial, as in the case that I cited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is about consultation. The Government must consult local authorities and other organisations about the issue. A letter from the Commission for Racial Equality to members of the Committee states that it is very worried about the Bill's effect on political activity, in the context of community relations councils. The CRE fears that the Bill will prevent people from doing things that would genuinely benefit such bodies. When he replies, perhaps the Minister will respond to this point, which the commission raised. Like my hon. Friend, I cannot support a position in which the Secretary of State is the person who will define "political activities". That is a dangerous road to travel. The Miniser must give us serious answers to these points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Minister on his interpretation of subsection (5)? He and others will realise that there is a distinction to be drawn between his intentions and the powers that the subsection would confer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5) confers upon the Secretary of State a substantial discretion which, within the framework of the Bill, is not inhibited or limited in any way. The subsection provides that the terms of appointment or conditions of employment
	<br><q><p>"shall be deemed to incorporate such requirements for restricting his political activities as may be prescribed for the purposes of this subsection by regulations made by the Secretary of State."</p></q>
—a discretion that could hardly be expressed in more unfettered terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (6) does not provide any inhibition or restriction upon the discretion conferred by subsection (5). My hon. Friend asked whether the Minister intends to proscribe membership of a political party. Some of us accept the sincerity of the Minister's reply that that was not intended. None the less, the power to do it is contained in a prospective statute. We are concerned that the matter should be left in this unfettered, discretionary way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) prayed in aid the provisions of clause 2(3). which sets out what I understand are certain criteria that would cause a local authority post to fall within its ambit. It could be argued that, this being the exercise of a statutory power by a statutory body, the opportunity for judicial review might be available. The extent to which judicial review is an effective remedy for an aggrieved person is always determined by the extent of the discretion conferred upon the statutory authority whose unreasonable exercise of discretion is challenged. I am worried that if clause 2(3) is prayed in aid by the minister to assist him, this in turn conveys a wide discretion which might be unsusceptible to successful challenge by judicial review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will find time in his busy schedule to respond to my remarks on subsection (5) and say why he is unwilling to accept our apprehensions that the powers conferred on his right hon. Friend are unduly extensive, and that they might, in the hands of someone less responsible than the Minister, give rise to considerable injustice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the key question is what would constitute taking part in political activity by people who might be defined as holding a politically-restricted post. As from October, school boards will be introduced into Scotland, and it will be possible for people who hold politically-restricted posts, as the Bill deinfes them, to stand for election as parent representatives to the board and even to go onto the boards as co-opted members. Also in the pipeline is the Self-Governing Schools etc. (Scotland) Bill, which has its Second Reading next week. It will allow school boards to opt out of local authority controls and be funded directly by the Secretary of State for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a matter of political controversy whether a school should opt out of the local authority system in Scotland or come under direct grant in Scotland. Would those circumstances be a reason for excluding parents from a board if they held politically-restricted posts? If they were members of a school board, perhaps they would have to speak in public on a matter of political controversy as well as write about it. The Minister will have to make it clear whether the Bill will apply to parents who are members of a school board and who have employment in a politically-restricted post.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other Scottish organisations will be affected by the Bill—the Campaign for a Scottish Assembly, for example. It would be difficult to argue that membership of the campaign was a party political activity, because it crosses party lines. Conservative members have called for support for the Campaign for a Scottish Assembly and take part in it. Would people be debarred from membership of a local authority because they belonged to the publicly-supported campaign? Likewise, would it apply to an organisation such as Shelter, because could not people speak and participate in support of the housing charity? How would having a politically-restricted post apply there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman does not hold a politically-restricted post in a local authority. If he did, no doubt he would object strongly to being excluded from taking part in Shelter's work. If he feels strongly about that, I hope that he will vote with the Opposition on the amendments rather than going along with the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are important matters. All sorts of activities could be described as politically controversial. There was furore in Dundee over whether there should be a travel interchange in that city. Should a person not be allowed to speak on such an issue in Dundee simply because he happens to hold a politically-restricted post under the terms of the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may again say, as he did to the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) that clause 2(3) will leave it to local authorities to interpret the provision. If that is so, will it mean that no attempt will be made to apply consistency in local authorities in Scotland, and England and Wales, and that it will be a matter of whoever controls a local authority deciding how to define the term "politically restricted post", or will the Minister apply regulations that would insist upon a consistent approach to the definition throughout Scotland? I hope that he will answer my questions, including that about school boards, because the measure is being imposed upon Scottish people against their will and the logic of the Bill is such that those who participate will be debarred from taking an interest in their children's education through the school board system if they hold politically-restricted local authority posts as the Bill defines them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of amendments have been grouped together, and it is necessary to make a brief distinction between them, if you will allow that, Mr. Hunt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 16 would provide that the only restrictions upon the political activity of senior local government officers in the politically-restricted group is that they would be disqualified from becoming, or remaining, a member of a local authority, a Member of Parliament of a Member of the European Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment runs contrary to the recommendations of the Widdicombe committee, and we intend that the regulations should reflect those recommendations. Widdicombe suggested, first, that they should be prohibited from political activities including
	<br><q><p>"(I) standing for and holding public elected office"—</p></q>
I suppose that that is parallel with the proposal in amendment No. 16—
	<br><q><p>"(II) holding office in a political party"—</p></q>
that would deal, for example, with the chief executive who was also the chairman of the local Labour party—
	<br><q><p>"(III) speaking or writing in public in a personal capacity in a way that might be regarded as engaging in party political debate"—</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
as I said in reply to an intervention from the hon. Member for Normanton at our last sitting, I find it equally unacceptable that the person should be chairman of the Conservative party or, indeed, of any party—
	<br><q><p>"(IV) canvassing at elections".</p></q>
The restrictions are less onerous than those that are imposed on similar people in the Civil Service, and the third:
	<br><q><p>"speaking or writing in public in a personal capacity in a way that might be regarded as engaging in party political debate",</p></q>
is specifically proposed by Widdicombe and will be mirrored in the regulations to enable local government officers to continue writing in local government journals, as they have in the past, about matters relating to local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Civil servants in such conditions are not allowed to do that, but we felt it right to mirror as much as possible the best practice and what was, in most cases, the universal practice until very recently. So there is a clear protection which we want to continue and which we have discussed with local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister's statement mean that while officers in the politically-restricted category would be able to write for, say, the 	<i>Local Government Chronicle,</i> they would not be allowed to write for 	<i>The Sunday Times</i> or 	<i>The Guardian</i> on the same subject in the same vein because that would be influencing and involved in a political activity?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, may I explore the Minister's comparison with the Civil Service in terms of the contract that will be applied to people? It does not apply to the politically-free group in the Civil Service and applies to the intermediate group—whose salaries, incidentally, with London weighting, are up to almost £19,000—only if the manager immediately above agrees, and there is a right of appeal to a tribunal which includes a trade union representative. The Minister should tell us not only what will be acceptable in terms of being able to speak or write outside, and which vehicles would be acceptable, but how it compares with the Civil Service, in which people are allowed to take part in local politics and be politically active. That is possible, even for people in the intermediate group, and even, if permission is given, for people in the restricted group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall first correct an important point. It is not the manager immediately above a person in the Civil Service who makes that decision—it is the central personnel branch. It is perfectly true that it applies to the intermediate group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there would be no distinction between journals—except, perhaps, if the officer wrote in the 	<i>Conservative Newsline</i>—but apart from that, there is no distinction as to the vehicle. However, there is a distinction in tone. The Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and other local government associations understood very clearly the distinction between the chief officer writing about local government aspects of a matter of some political interest in a tone that would be proper and in one that would not be proper. In general, local government officers have made that distinction for many years
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0452">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>63</span>
and there have been few instances when that has not been possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are distinctions between these restrictions and those that apply to the Civil Service, and most of them give local government officers much more freedom, as befits their role. We have sought to do that, and if we have missed something, I shall be very happy to discuss the matter and try to solve the problem, because I do not want to be unduly restrictive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) asked why there has been no consultation with local government about the party-political restriction, but I think that he may have missed the sequence of events. First, the Widdicombe committee made its proposals, after which there were six months for local government to comment. We then published our White Paper, which was followed by another opportunity to comment. We took all the views that had been expressed into account, and then produced the Bill. Some of the changes in the Bill are the result of local government comments, and there will now be further consultation. Indeed, one of my objections to an amendment in this group is that it would mean waiting until the enactment of the Bill before we could recommence the consultations that are currently taking place on a number of aspects that would arise from regulations. Therefore, I assure the hon. Member for Truro that we have had a great deal of consultation, and that it will continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want the Minister to misinterpret what said. I did not say that he had not spoken with local authorities on any aspects. I asked why he had not followed the specific Widdicombe recommendation that this should not be done through legislation if it was possible to draw up guidelines as a result of consultation with the local authorities. That specific question is rather different from the broader question of consulting on legislation—something that I would hope could have been avoided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I am on my feet, may I comment on what the Minister said about what is proper? The difficulty about defining what is proper is that it is like defining what is taste. The Minister may be convinced that he knows what is good taste, and he may be convinced that others do not have it, but they may not necessarily agree with him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that there is a difficulty, and for many years it was overcome because people exercised self-restraint. But they no longer do so, and that is why legislation is necessary. I have always said that I wished that we did not need the legislation. I wish it were not true, for example, that since we started our deliberations on the Bill the number of cases of people behaving in that way has been much larger than we expected. Unfortunately, we have to legislate because people do not exercise self-restraint.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The practices, described by the Minister, that are carried out by Labour parties and Tory parties are on the whole quite good, but all pale into insignificance compared with the actions of political appointees of this Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a load of old rubbish. If the hon.

If that is what he thinks, he is further removed from the generality of the public than even I thought. If he wants to become electable for government, the first thing that he should do is to listen to a few people other than the Hammersmith and Fulham Labour party management committees, because it seems that they are the only people that he listens to. If he looks a bit further, he will discover that most people in this country are appalled to discover that people take a party-political activity in one council and are paid to do a job of an independent nature on another. No normal person thinks otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listen widely and I travel widely, so I put this to the Minister. The London Boroughs Association is deeply worried and disturbed by the clause. The right hon. Gentleman knows that—he has read its evidence.

Gentleman hides the truth if he suggests that they are not wholly opposed to twin-tracking. Just because they may have a different way of dealing with it, he cannot pray that in aid of supporting the principle. If the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to consultation.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>65</span>
was made through and with that board to ascertain whether the Widdicombe proposals could be followed, legislation being the last resort? It appears to have been used as a first resort. Can the Minister elaborate on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A judgment had to be made. From the general reaction of various local authority groups and local authorities, it was clear that a significant number did not consider such a change necessary. Their views are well represented on the Opposition Benches. In those circumstances, we had to decide whether we were likely to get an agreed and acceptable system through consultation. We made it plain in the White Paper that we did not want to follow the Widdicombe proposal, and that we would make specific recommendations, as we have. We consulted local authorities on that. Indeed, of all the matters on which local authorities have expressed their views and concern, this one has not loomed large in their objections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most people recognise that several local authorities are wholly committed to the continuance of twin-tracking. Given that, it is not possible to find a compromise between those who do not want twin-tracking to stop and those who do. As I said before, it is better to be honest and straightforward about such matters. I did not consider—and neither, I believe, did my colleagues—that there was any point in bringing together the two sides, one of which wanted the restrictions and one of which did not want them at all. Therefore, we thought it better to put forward specific proposals. We have consulted on them and shall continue to do so. That approach seemed fairer and more above board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the Minister. Part of the problem is that he has given no details of the proposals.

I confirm precisely what I said—that having listened to the initial reactions of the local authorities and their groups, it was clear that some were irredeemably opposed to any restriction on twin-tracking. The hon. Gentleman cannot really object to our making it clear that we therefore decided to pursue this course of action. We made that public; everyone has known that. Local authorities' opposition to this provision has been more muted than it has been to many others. They have not considered it crucial perhaps because, in their heart of hearts, they realised that there was no possibility of a nationally agreed position when some councils were wholly opposed to any such change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I promised the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) that I should give way, and it is only fair that he should speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. Does he mean that, if there is any suggestion that individuals, organisations or groups in local government are not prepared to propose a clear alternative, that justifies legislating as he described? In other words, it seems that Oppostion Members' suggestions on how to proceed can be dismissed, as can suggestions about codes of practice, merely because some people do not favour any of the options. That is a novel way to proceed in terms of government by edit—if there is oposition, one justifies taking the hardest possible line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to ask the Minister about public disquiet—he mentioned this to my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley)—about how contracts will be applied. Does he think that if his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary had been elected to Richmond council, public disquiet about the hon. Lady's role in the Brixton and Camberwell child guidance unit and her politically active role on Richmond council would have legitimised the Bill nine years ago? Would the Minister have considered it necessary to intervene on such a matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions must be briefer than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I conclude by saying that at least another 14 Members of Parliament, including the hon. Member for Batley and Spen (Mrs. Peacock), fall into the same category of causing grave public disquiet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend never stood as a candidate for Richmond council and so would not have been elected to it. Therefore, the situation would not have arisen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more general comment of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) suggested that he had not followed what I said. It was suggested that we might reach an agreement with local authorities on how to proceed and that all local authorities would follow that course. But it would be naive to suggest that such an option was available to us. To pursue a fruitless discussion with those who had no intention of reaching an agreement would not have been sensible. Surely it was better to be honest rather than to go through a charade and then to say, "We have done that. We have done what Widdicombe said." We could have gone through that process, but it would probably have helped no one. Moreover, it would have demonstrated some naivety and perhaps even an undercurrent of dishonesty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman suggested that such an approach meant discounting all other options. That is not so. If a group of councillors suggested an alternative which looked as though it would command general support, or if Opposition Members had better suggestions and the Government thought them appropriate, I should be the first to give way. The hon. Member for Brightside may recognise that in Committee proceedings on other Bills I have endeavoured to accommodate Opposition proposals and I am anxious to do so now if that is possible. I cannot agree with his present suggestions, however,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0454">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>67</span>
for what, I hope, are good reasons. I should like to discuss those reasons but, first, I give way to the hon. Member of Tottenham (Mr. Grant).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems strange that at a time when the Government are trying to make the public sector more like the private sector, they are prepared to enter into voluntary agreements and codes of conduct with the private sector yet refuse to do so with the public sector. I do not understand why. Will the Minister explain why it was not possible to get a voluntary code of conduct on twin-tracking?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have been present for all our debates, Mr. Hunt, and have heard the Opposition's views on twin-tracking. They largely relate to people who say that there is nothing wrong with it and that it has been going on for years. During the whole of his speech, the hon. Member for Normanton did not condemn the activities of Councillor Beeley. We heard not a word about that, presumably because he did not think them worthy of condemning. Yet it seems to be suggested that we could come to an agreement with those who believe that there is nothing wrong with the process. That is a singular attitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most ordinary people probably would find it difficult to imagine how Councillor Beeley could be of use to Wakefield council in advising it on privatisation matters, given that he already had a party political reputation of being opposed to privatisation. Never mind what he could do in Bradford, I cannot imagine anyone thinking that he was impartial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's remarks, I feel that I should put the record straight. Councillor Beeley was appointed to guide the Wakefield authority on privatisation matters. I am pleased to report that because of that guidance and the local authority's work, it won, in-house, the contract for building cleaning. Wakefield ratepayers will benefit because the contract was won by the local authority undercutting other contractors. Some credit must go to Councillor Beeley for his work. The Minister is incorrect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That dramatises the problem with the amendments. I merely suggested that Councillor Beeley would have done the work more efficiently if he had been a credible independent. He is an incredible independent adviser because, while giving advice on a supposedly independent basis to Wakefield, he was leader of the Labour council in Bradford. That makes him incredible on two grounds. First, not many people in Wakefield would have believed him if he had said that his advice was entirely unconnected with his political views. He may have applied an entirely open mind to the issues, but he was put in a difficult position. An independent officer would not have found himself in that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, let us suggest that Councillor Beeley suddenly realised, impartially, that it would be to the advantage of the people of Wakefield if steps were taken that might facilitate a private enterprise body winning the contract. Can we believe that the man
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
who insisted that no private enterprise organisation win a contract in Bradford could have impartially suggested the opposite to Wakefield? I do not believe so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not deny that the hon. Member for Normanton claims that twin-tracking is all right. I say merely that those who suggest that it would have been possible to have an agreed code of conduct between those who believe that such conduct is despicable and those who think it is laudable seem to be living in Cloud-cuckoo land. It reminds me of my SLDP/SDP/Liberal opponent at the last general election. Each time she was asked a question at the joint churches meeting, she began her answer by saying, "We really must get together on this." The last question related to what we were going to do about AIDS. The Socialist candidate turned to me and said, "At least she cannot say on this that we have got to get together." But she did: she said that we must get together about the problems of AIDS, at which the entire audience, churchmen though they may be, collapsed in laughter because it was her only answer to every difficult question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Had we—those who, like the hon. Member for Normaton laud twin-tracking, and those who, like me, despise it—got together, we would have had to agree to differ. Is it not better to admit at the beginning that there is an irreconcilable gap between us on the issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I indicated that I would give way to the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett). After that, I shall be happy to give way to others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am left almost speechless, Mr. Hunt—[Hon. Members: "But not quite."] Not quite. It is rather like those who are in favour of God and those who are not: there is nowhere in between. Would the Minister say whether his antagonism to what he has just described and his words about the Leader of the Labour group on Bradford council would apply to the former Conservative chair of Somerset education committee being appointed directly to a principal officer post in the Department of Education and Science, knowing that his views on comprehensive education or opting out might be suspect in view of his past Conservative allegiances? Does he feel that that is despicable? Does he despise it, and he will consider outlawing it because he despises open, elected and democratic policies being operated in local government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That last sentence is very far from the truth. I believe in open, democratic politics in local government. All I say is that a person cannot be an elected party political member of one authority and pretend to be an independent officer of another without much stretching of credibility and imagination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the example that the hon. Member for Brightside gave, I should find equally despicable a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0455">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>69</span>
leader of a Conservative council acting as an independent officer of another council. I would find that unacceptable in any party, whatever the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to the hon. Gentleman's previous attack, I made it clear that the case that he mentioned then—I do not know about the case that he now cites, so I shall not comment on it—regarding someone concerned with housing management in Sheffield who was a local councillor in a neighbouring Conservative authority, was inappropriate and totally unacceptable. I reiterate that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Several hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I promised the hon. Member for Fife, North-East that I would give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I did not have the pleasure of being his opponent at the last general election. Had I, without doubt I should not have said that he and I should get together to deal with the problem of AIDS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall offer a parallel example of where twin-tracking takes place at the heart of the Government. The Secretary of State for the Environment is a member of a Government who propose measures that are based on their political judgments and opinions. He has also to demonstrate his impartiality under the Town and Country Planning Acts when issues come to him for resolution, especially when matters are called in, or public inquiries report to him. It has never been suggested that Secretaries of State for the Environment find it impossible to fulfil the dual responsibility of being members of a politically motivated Government while discharging the impartial responsibilities which the statute necessarily imposes upon them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was never suggested that all the officials who advise my right hon. Friend should be barred from party political activity. The hon. and learned Gentleman cannot have one without the other. We suspect that, at present, senior officers and people involved in sensitive matters in local authorities are able to twin-track. The twin-tracking that the Government allow has never applied to civil servants, especially not to people who would give the sort of advice that my right hon. Friend would require in such circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Member for Newham, North-West asked first. I do not wish to come between the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister described twin-tracking as despicable. Even in areas of political activity where the over-eloquent phrase is often used, that is an exaggerated description of something that is neither illegal nor immoral. The Minister is wrong. It is not a question of Opposition Members being in favour of twin-tracking and him being against—some
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
people are uneasy about twin-tacking, and I happen to be one of them. The hon. Gentleman is not prepared to make a sensible attempt to tackle the problem. I suggested proper payment of councillors or employers giving time off. The hon. Gentleman appears to want to approach the matter as if it were a crime. We find his attitude unacceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misunderstands. Being despicable is not a matter of crime, although all crime is despicable. Many actions are despicable but they are not crimes. I used the expression advisedly. Twin-tracking is not a practice that people usually consider admirable. They normally consider it improper. There is a range of cases where twin-tracking is despicable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a range of cases where twin-tracking is despicable. It is only because I have tried not to have arguments ad hominem or ad whatever the term for women is; I am not being sexist. I am not being ad hominem because I do not wish to pillory individuals, but some people have clearly been paid to do a job in one authority and have not done it. Instead, they have spent their working hours as leading councillors on another authority. That is without question a despicable form of twin-tracking, and I could give many other examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other forms of twin-tracking an independent arbiter would support an individual's judgment that there was no conflict, and these would not be despicable. In between there is a range of different arrangements, but in general the public find the principle unacceptable. In some examples, they find it downright wrong and not only despicable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for allowing me to return to the question of officers who are paid by one local authority and who serve on another. What about individuals in private industry and commerce? I know of councillors employed by a private body or company who are given as much paid time as they wish to carry out their political activities. If the Minister condemns the practice in the private sector as well as in local authorities, I will agree. Otherwise, he is being hypocritical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must think a little further along that line. Let us suppose that two local authorities are both controlled by the Conservative party. It is difficult to understand how one authority could be acting entirely impartially in its ratepayers' interest if it appointed as its adviser on the opting out of schools a chairman of a neighbouring Conservative authority's education committee. The appointment would be considered a little biased and an odd use of ratepayers' money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if a company decided that as part of its contribution to the general advantages of its local community it would allow generous time off to an employee who was a local Liberal alliance councillor, that practice would not be considered a misuse of public funds or a partial decision. The hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) must accept the distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with twin-tracking is that, first, it creates serious doubt about the impartiality of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0456">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
appointment. Secondly it is difficult to understand how such a person can be an impartial officer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being generous in giving way. I accept that this is a difficult part of the Bill for him and for the Government. The Government have dug themselves into the most incredible hole and the Minister is only digging deeper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was one of those who tried to change the system, which the Government have defended, whereby a Conservative councillor or, equally a Labour councillor, is appointed as a magistrate through the political system. Recommendations are made. The Lord Chancellor defended the system and, indeed, there is something to be said for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that a magistrate serves on a police committee. According to the Minister's two arguments, the magistrate is no longer independent. Apparently it is despicable that the magistrate serves on the committee. Moreover, he or she is overseeing the administration of justice as a JP while serving on a police committee, which deals with the enforcement of law. It is a central principle of the British legal system that the administration and enforcement of law should be kept separate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that the Minister has dug himself into the most incredible hole. He is saying that magistrates who have come up through the party political system and who are also councillors are incapable of being independent. Frankly, the Minister is saying that they are despicable, and I disagree entirely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is advancing an argument that has a semblance of validity only if the magistrate serves on the joint police committee. Later I shall explain why there is a distinction otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I refer to independence I am talking about independence in the exercise of a particular function. The distinction is clear and there is no hole to be dug. Those in the hole are Labour Members because no one else agrees with them. Their argument is unacceptable to any ordinary person and is universally derided. It is seen for what it is—an attempt to defend jobs for the boys. [	<i>Laughter.</i>] Mirth usually arises from the Opposition Benches when hon. Members are uneasy in their consciences about their proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is the ability to be both a politically elected councillor and an independent servant of a politically elected council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) referred to the one arrangement where I agree that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
there is a difficulty. I have always said so. A problem arises where responsibility is shared in a joint decision-making body to which people can come from two different routes and where they have to come to terms with particular issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to answer an important and serious question from the hon. Member for Hammersmith. I shall try to give the answer clearly, even though hon. Gentleman may not approve of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A parallel question is why church representatives on education committees have a vote whereas others who are co-opted to such committees do not. The analogy is that they are joint providers of education. On magistrates' committees, a local authority and magistrates are jointly responsible for the provision of justice in the area. It has always been accepted that JPs serving on such a committee could also be councillors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that this is a marginal area. If hon. Members feel strongly, they should table an amendment, which we could discuss. I know that the hon. Member for Hammersmith gets hot under the collar. We all feel strongly on the issue. If he feels that there is a lacuna and that we should make exclusions in these circumstances, why does he not table a suitable amemdment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has not said what the Minister suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) must not put words into my mouth or into his hon. Friend's mouth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Hammersmith is worried, his concern would be more properly discussed under a specific amendment than on the general amendment to which I am speaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given way so frequently that I have not progressed no further than the first page of my response to amendment No. 16.
