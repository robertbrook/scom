	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND HOUSING BILL</h1></div>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 93</div> <!-- clause -->
	<p>The interest of the applicant in the property</p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [this day]:</i> No. 633, in page 83, line 28, leave out subsection (5) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(5) Nothing in this Part shall prevent a local authority from entertaining an application from a tenant provided that the authority is satisfied that the tenant has an interest in the property and has not proposed or does not propose to acquire an owner's interest in the property.'</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>—[	<i>Mr. Tony Banks.</i>]</p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 632, in page 83, line 28, at end insert 'except in special circumstances'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the environment (Mrs Virginia Bottomley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to assure the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) that, in most cases, we believe that responsibility for essential repairs and improvements of property rests with the landlord, not the tenant. When it clearly does not, for example when the tenant has a repairing obligation, the tenant should be eligible to apply for a grant. The Bill provides for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Were we to permit all private tenants to apply for a grant, we would provide no incentive to landlords to carry out the work that is properly their responsibility. Moreover, a landlord may have the incentive to collude with the tenant in not carrying out the work and may encourage the tenant to apply for a grant in the knowledge that he may be treated more favourably than the landlord. Such a provision would not be a proper solution, as it would take place at the expense of another who might need a grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also consider such a restriction on granting aid to tenants in the light of the strengthened powers that we gave to local authorities in the Housing Act 1988 to take action against landlords who were unwilling to carry out essential repair or improvement work. Those steps, together with the freeing of the market for tenanted properties under the Act, emphasise our determination to ensure that private-sector landlords take seriously their obligations and carry out the work for which they are responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wholly misguided to give tenants with no such responsibilities the right to a grant. That would benefit no one, apart from the less scrupulous landlords. We recognise that many private tenants without repairing obligations need minor works carried out to their homes if they are to live in comfort and dignity. That is why we intend to make a minor grant available to them under new clause 8. I assure the hon. Member for Newham, North-West that the position of private tenants is likely to be improved rather than made worse by the provisions of the Bill, together with those in the 1988 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1052</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Clive Soley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hammersmith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks), who is either detained with or by the Home Secretary, I wish to ask the Minister to clarify the position of council tenants. Surely it is right that they sould be eligible for a grant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not right. The intention behind part VI of the Bill is to ensure that councils fulfil their obligations to their tenants. That is the purpose of management and maintenance. It would not be right for council tenants to be eligible for grants under this part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand why tenants generally should not be eligible for a grant. I accept that there may have to be safeguards in such a provision. What about the tenants of housing associations or housing co-operatives? Will they be excluded from the Bill? I see that the civil servants are nodding, but that could mean yes or no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clear answer to the hon. Gentleman is that housing association tenants will be eligible for grants, but that it would be wrong for council tenants to be eligible. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that local authorities fulfil their proper obligations as landlords. There is no repairing requirement for a local authority tenant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell the Committee why housing association tenants should be given a grant, and why it should not be given to local authority tenants?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Housing association tenants are private-sector tenants. In short, the measures will lead to clarification of the position of private tenants and we are confident that they will be welcomed as they will ensure that tenants get a better deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I suspected, this is not an even-handed approach. The Under-Secretary is virtually shouting that housing associations come under the private sector, but they do not. They are in a mixed funding sector, being both private and public. Everyone knows that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<b>Interruption.</b></p>
	<p>Is the Minister saying that they do not get public funds?</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. David Trippier)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one has ever suggested that housing associations do not, but the tenants are in subsidised accommodation. There are plenty of examples of subsidised accommodation in the private sector. It is stupid of the hon. Gentleman to suggest to the Committee, as he has sought to do in the House on a number of occasions, that housing associations are anything other than private.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have the housing association movement solidly on my side in this argument I can reveal that hardly anyone in it thinks of himself or herself as being in the private sector. The movement was set up under all-party agreement and I suggest that the Minister speaks to one of his colleagues who was a shadow Minister before the 1979 election when everyone was saying that housing associations were not in the private sector. What has happened to make the Conservative party change sides on that issue? The reason is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1001">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1053</span>
that the Government and the present Secretary of State want housing associations to be placed in the private sector. The right hon. Gentleman wants to push them from being semi-public funded into being dependent on private funds, but that is what the housing association movement is rightly resisting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am fascinated by the argument that housing association tenants can have a grant, but council tenants cannot because, according to the Minister, councils are good landlords. Yet, the Government are saying that local authority tenants should cease to be such and become either housing association tenants or private-sector tenants. We were told that they may need grants, but the Minister argues that as local authorities will be good landlords their tenants will not need grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Glasgow study supports what the Minister said in an odd sort of way, but is she really saying that because local authorities should be good landlords, grants are not necessary, and as housing associations may not be able to provide such good services, grants are necessary? Let the Minister give the Committee a clear answer to that question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is disappointing that the hon. Gentleman should pursue his vendetta against all forms of housing not provided by local authorities. We have been over this ground often in Committee. The country has a greater percentage of its housing in the hands of local authorities than any other in Europe, so it must be right to encourage and promote a diversity of supply of subsidised housing for people who need it. There are no two ways about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to whether housing association tenants are eligible for grants, I may have misled the hon. Gentleman to an extent, as only tenants who have a repairing requirement in their leases are eligible for them. Council tenants have no requirement in their leases to repair the properties they inhabit. The way in which local authority housing is financed is a subject for debate under other parts of the Bill, but we have made it abundantly clear that we expect local authorities to make proper provision for the repair, maintenance and management of the houses for which they are reponsible, so there is no difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point of the clause is that eligibility for grant should be restricted to tenants who have a specific obligation to carry out proposed work or who have a tenancy of the type that is specified. The matter is as simple and clear as that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a block of flats is transferred to another landlord—perhaps a housing association—and some tenants who vote against the transfer remain with the council landlord but have leases drawn up by the new landlord, will those tenants receive grants?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That depends on who has the basic tenancy. If the lease includes an obligation to repair, tenants will be eligible for grants. Otherwise, they will not be eligible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, those tenants will not be eligible for grants because they will still be council tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows extremely well what the position is. If tenants exercise the right to go to a housing association as an alternative landlord in the private sector—that is how we and the housing association would define the matter, despite what the hon. Gentleman said—
	<span class='label label-info column'>1054</span>
they may be eligible, if they qualify under the tenancy agreement, as my hon. Friend said. If a local authority property remains with a local authority—we accept that many may do so—the tenants will be eligible for improvements and repairs through the local authority's housing programme, assisted by housing investment programmes, estate action moneys and community refurbishment schemes. Those are different from the grants that we are discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be pleasant if I could say that the two Ministers do not understand, but 50 per cent. understand and 50 per cent. do not. The hon. Gentleman knows that he is giving favourable conditions to tenants who are not council tenants. It should be made clear that the provision applies to all tenants. If the Government are serious about their concern for tenants, they would not worry about who the landlords are. They would worry only about good housing management, whether private, public or in between—for example, housing associations. That is what the Conservative party said before it was taken over by the present crowd of neolithic destroyers, which is interested only in smashing the provision for housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We wish to make progress, but it is deeply offensive of the hon. Gentleman to speak in those terms about clause 93. We have made the position abundantly clear and it would be wrong for grants to be made available to tenants who have no obligation to repair their property. It is the height of irresponsibility for the hon. Gentleman to use the clause to stir up a sterile, hostile argument and to encourage paranoia and suspicion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities should be good landlords and fulfil their responsibilities. At the same time, we wish to make proper provision for tenants who have such responsibilities, as well as private landlords. The matter is simple and straightforward and it is wrong of the hon. Gentleman to try to divert the debate in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister, as a former psychiatric worker, should know the old saying that if someone is paranoid that does not mean that he is not being got at. I know what is happening, as does every member of the Committee. The standard for council tenants is lower than for tenants generally. We shall press the matter to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>leave out 'intends' and insert 'undertakes'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 635, in page 84, line 9,
	<br><blockquote><p>leave out 'intends' and insert 'undertakes'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to elicit from the Minister how the regulations will operate in the light of the changes under the 1988 legislation and the considerable emphasis on private landlords. The word "intends" in terms of whether someone should receive a grant to facilitate lettings is not strong enough. People are being positively encouraged to use their facilities for private lettings under the clauses that we are discussing this afternoon, so we must be far more certain than in the past that those who receive grants will use them and that the facilities will be upgraded with the grant as intended. It is not unreasonable to suggest that the word "undertakes" should be substituted for "intends".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who receive a grant should give a clear undertaking that they will use their accommodation for private lettings and that they will not renege on that intention. We believe that the word "intends" is vague and would be difficult to enforce. Those providing the grants could not follow up their decision adequately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was not a dramatic problem in the past. The Minister emphasised the need to change the myths of landlordism in the rented sector and, in the changed climate in which we find ourselves, we should be more careful about the words that we use. Grant givers should be able to follow up matters once the grant has been given and the work has been undertaken. In our view, that is reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be interested to hear the argument against the word "undertake"—or "undertakes". What we have done to the public tenant and to rented housing led me to leave off the "s". "Undertakes" seems a reasonable way to ensure that public money is used for the intention for which it was given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We fully understand the thought behind the hon. Gentleman's amendment, but I shall try to explain why we do not consider it appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It causes great frustration when a grant is given on a property in the expectation that the applicant will move in, but the property remains empty for a long period. Clearly, that could seem a waste of scarce public resources, and authorities are right to be worried. The purpose of many of the clauses in part VIII is to ensure that money is used appropriately and in the tenant's interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, the certificates are not in themselves binding conditions of grant. An authority will be free to take action under civil or criminal law if it becomes plain that an
	<span class='label label-info column'>1056</span>
applicant has obtained grant by deceipt, having made a false statement. If it is clear before grant is paid that the applicant does not intend to use the property in the way that has been certified, payment of grant will be refused under clause 111. Failure to comply with the terms of the certificate does not lead to an automatic right to recover grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that it may be easier to base criminal prosecutions on the default of a given undertaking, as opposed to a statement of intention. Against that must be balanced the fact that an undertaking could be honestly given at the time of an application, yet circumstances conspire to make it impossible for the applicant to fulfil the undertaking. The Bill makes no provision for dealing with the consequences of a breach of such an undertaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no simple answer. Grants are not available for second homes, and if an authority has good reason to believe that grant has been taken up for that purpose, it should seek a remedy through the courts. We must allow some flexibility to protect the innocent applicant. Although I endorse the thought behind the amendment, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will understand why we are unable to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that we do not. That was a sound argument in favour of using the word "undertakes" but the Minister then rejected it on the grounds that it might not be fair to a few people who, with the best intentions, had given an undertaking and were unable to fulfil it. In those circumstances the grant could be recovered by a consequent sale, or the local authority could be given discretion to waive the undertaking, as has been done for many years when people have been reasonable with eash other. If the word "intends" is used, it is impossible for the authority to pursue the matter once the grant has been given and spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister put it on the record that, when people go to court in cases where they have received grant but not used it for the purpose for which it was intended, we can presume that the word "undertake" would have been used, and the proceedings of the Committee may be cited in evidence? That would be extremely helpful. If such an undertaking is not given, we shall have no alternative but to press this reasonable amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman appreciates that it is still possible for an authority to take action under civil or criminal law if it becomes plain that an applicant has obtained grant by deceit. There is every reason why it should do so. Our intentions are much the same: money should not be appropriated falsely or with the wrong expectations. We cannot accept the amendment simply because we believe that the word "undertakes" would mean that someone who, through no fault of his own, could not fulfil that commitment would be needlessly caught. We certainly share the view that money should not be used inappropriately and that every effort should be made to take action if the system has been abused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We seem to have fallen between one and the other. I should like to discuss the new clauses. I am proud of them, not ashamed of them.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amemdment would remove the Secretary of State's ability to limit the discretion of the local authority. These are largely probing amendments seeking to answer the following questions: In what circumstances would the Secretary of State restrict eligible works? What works are they likely to be? Why should the Secretary of State be able to do that for some authorities, but not for others?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the years local authorities have adopted their own improvement grant strategy. How would the Secretary of State decide priorities and the need for investment on the basis of his knowledge, as opposed to the knowledge of the local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot envisage a circumstance which would upset the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy), in which the Secretary of State would use the powers that the amendments seek to remove.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A particular local authority might have been using the arrangements in a way that the Government considered unacceptable, because certain descriptions of work it was allowing were not, as a whole, considered to be priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the view of the hon. Member for Torfaen of the role of the Secretary of State is different from mine. That has divided us several times during our proceedings. The Secretary of State must have some overview of the nation's priorities—that is his role—whereas a local council has an overview of the priorities of its area. We wish to retain for the Secretary of State a reserve power to use in circumstances that, I concede, would be extremely rare. I cannot at this moment think of any in which I would recommend the Secretary of State to use such powers. However, he must
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1004">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1059</span>
have the power to say, "Look, this particular use of the grant would be unacceptable", or, "If it is to be used, this type of work should be excluded unless specific consent is given." I do not find that objectionable. I would find it objectionable if the Secretary of State were to use the power more than occasionally. I give the Committee an absolute undertaking that that is not the Government's intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that while the Labour party is in Opposition and we are in power it does not wish the Secretary of State to have any such powers. Were matters reversed, the Opposition might possibly be asking for the same powers. As there is little likelihood of our positions being reversed, I can understand the tenacity with which they hold to the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Seriously, it is necessary for the Secretary of State to be able to say as a last resort that the use of the grant in this area for this purpose is outwith the purpose of the legislation and will have an effect contrary to our intentions. I assure the hon. Member for Torfaen that I would not recommend that the power be used in any circumstances currently obtaining, and I hope that it will never have to be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garry Waller 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Keighley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the circumstances of the Bradford council have been considered as appropriate for the Secretary of State's power? The then Labour-controlled Bradford council formulated a rule that moneys for improvement grants would be available only in certain wards that happened to be represented by Labour councillors. Consequently, people in those wards received grants more easily, while those in other wards found it difficult to get grants even for urgent and necessary work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be wrong of me to disagree with my hon. Friend, who is known to be particular about the accuracy of the information from his locality. In such a circumstance it would be proper for anyone who had the power to insist that grants were given on a proper basis. I do not want to follow him into the internal affairs of Bradford. It is clear that the change of control there is so overwhelmingly to the benefit of the people that it is becoming an embarrassment to repeat it too often. I know that the Labour party is increasingly worried about it, as it realises that the many changes taking place should have been undertaken when it was in power. This is not the moment to rub salt into the wound, particularly in the absence of the Liberal/SLD party.

I have checked on the figures and discovered that in the 36 Divisions so far in Committee, Liberal and SLD Members have always voted with the Opposition and never with the Government.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not dream of doing so. It is not my custom to agree or disagree with hypothetical circumstances of the kind raised as an example of the use of these powers. It would be wrong for the Government not to have the reserve powers, and wrong of the Government to use them in any but exceptional circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you have ruled quite rightly, Mr. Hunt, that we do not talk about Bradford and other places, my replies will be somewhat more technical and less political.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The associations are deeply concerned not about what, in some people's views, rogue local authorities may do, but about what most authorities would do in response to this matter. The Prime Minister talks about rolling back the frontiers of the state. Surely, therefore, we should not give the Secretary of State extra or even reserve powers in measure after measure when there is no proof of their necessity. I am waiting to hear in what circumstances, apart from in the party-political sense, the Secretary of State would have to intervene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not press the amendments to a Division as the Minister said that he will discuss them with the associations, and made the point that Secretaries of State would not use the powers if they could help it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I remind the Minister of the great variations in housing in different parts of the country and of the need to take them into account. The imposition of a common standard that ignores facts that have been well documented and published over many years could lead to large areas of housing stock not being improved. The clause as drafted ignores market forces, which the Government continue to promote. The amendment would help iron out the deficiencies in the clause and ensure a fairer distribution of housing grant aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all aware that applicants for renovation grants are to be means tested on the same basis as tenants and householders who apply for housing benefits. Housing benefit is supposed to cater for the everyday living expenses of applicants and their families. It must cover food, heating, lighting and other such items. It is clear that the proposed test does not take into account what would, for most people, be the biggest outlay from the family budget—the cost of housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would provide for average regional housing costs to be taken into account. As a result renovation work by owner-occupiers or tenants who wish both to make their property fit to live in and to stay above the poverty line would not be postponed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 642 is a crucial amendment to a crucial clause. It is a major departure from past grant policies. Previous grants were aimed at properties that were in a poor condition. The new policy seems to be targeting part of the grant on people who are perceived to need financial assistance to improve their home rather than the condition of the property. Clause 97 states that where an application for a grant is made by an owner occupier or a tenant, a test shall be carried out on the means of that applicant. It also provides for the Secretary of State to make regulations on how the means test will be calculated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment relates to subsection (3)(a) which provides that, when devising a test of resources, the Secretary of State can take into account the means of the applicant, the spouse, any person living with the applicant, and any person who is dependent on the applicant or on whom the applicant is dependent. The amendment restricts to an applicant or spouse the people whose means may be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is evidence that although grant policies have made an impact on the lack of basic amenities, such as baths, inside toilets and hot water supplies, there has been little impact on disrepair in the past six years. The figures bear that out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ask whether we should regard housing stock, public or private, as a national resource that is part of the infrastructure which we should not allow to deteriorate. That is an important question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several factors show that if a person has means, he will not necessarily use them to improve his property. Let us take
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1006">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1063</span>
the example of an unimproved house that is valued at about £68,000 in this part of the world. A revitalising job—putting in a damp course, a new roof and windows, carrying out timber treatment and other related work—would cost up to about £10,000. It may even cost £20,000. Yet the increase in the value of the house may be no more than £7,000. Unless the work is grant aided, there is no incentive to carry out the work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the case of a person who has an unimproved house that needs major work. The person may have additional means, so may decide to improve the house, but he may decide, because of the upheaval and discomfort that are involved, to go up-market and sell the property. In that case, the work is not done. There is a disincentive to carry out improvement work if there is no grant aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government need real evidence that grants for only those on low incomes will encourage take-up by those on the lowest incomes, and will not lead to a significant decline in the physical condition of our housing stock, before they embark on the dramatic change of policy proposed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are not prepared to reconsider the issue of means testing, the amendment offers a redrawing of the guidelines of a means test. Means tests are known to discourage applicants. We have a perfect example of that in non-means-tested child benefit, for which the take-up is about 97 per cent., compared with the much lower take-up of family credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view this a mean test, not a means test. It is laughable to ask applicants whether someone intends to live with them and to inquire into their financial background. The Government's poll tax recognises the problem and makes only the occupier or his or her spouse jointly or severally responsible for paying each other's charge. I suggest that a similar standard should apply here. By taking into account the applicant and spouse, the Bill will ensure financial independence from any other person, and will allow local authorities to recover payments, if any repayment of grant is required, from the applicant whose means have been taken into account when the grant was first approved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Simplicity of use should be one of the main criteria in drafting legislation. In this case, the amendment will allow authorities to determine grant applications from a known source. To ask applicants about their intentions is like asking the Minister to forecast the winner of the 4.30 at Newmarket. No authority can possibly determine the amount of grant available by taking into account the applicant's intentions, which could change daily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) mentioned the English house conditions survey of 1986. It said, in broad terms, that elderly people were among the worst housed. It pointed out that elderly people who lived alone were like to occupy property that was in poor condition. In fact, 19 per cent. of single pensioners had houses that were in poor condition. The report stated that the majority of long-term residents were elderly and occupied a disproportionately large share of housing which lacked basic amenities. In other words, the accommodation was unfit or in bad repair. Clearly, means testing the elderly will prevent them from carrying out the necessary works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had an elderly mother, who has just died. She was careful with her money, almost miserly, I say that with no disrespect to her. Elderly people feel that they must hang on to their money for an emergency or in case they are ill. Consequently, it is unlikely that we will encourage elderly people to part with their savings and put them into housing
	<span class='label label-info column'>1064</span>
renovation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Old people will also be put off by means testing. They will not want to face the problems involved. My elderly parents used to remind me of the time when means testing was introduced and how abhorrent it was to them. The majority of old people will have no truck with means testing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More importantly, old people are put off by the inconvenience that is caused by renovation. They must be encouraged, not hindered, to repair and improve their houses. Means testing will not achieve that. Old people will be put off by the procedures for obtaining planning permission, building consent and all other disruption that goes with building work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My message to the Minister is that means testing will stop the elderly doing such work. It will not encourage them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton competently dealt with some of the problems experienced by the disabled. The hon. Gentleman said that house adaptations for the disabled were different from ordinary home improvements. He said that properties did not necessarily increase in value if adaptations for the disabled were made. The kitchen and bathroom may be altered. Perhaps a bath is taken out and a shower put in. When that house is sold it is a disadvantage to some buyers who may want a bath and not a shower. That often happens with local authority housing. Houses that have been adapted for the disabled have proved difficult to let to "normal" tenants who do not want those adaptations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another important point was mentioned by hon. Member for Ealing, Acton. He said that housing adaptations were vital for disabled people who wished to remain in the community. Means testing will be a disincentive and could mean disabled people going into an institution. That will put further and greater demands on other public services, which none of us wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a disabled person lives in a house that he does not own, the householder would be means tested. That would be a real disincentive. The householder may not want to be means tested before an adaptation to the house is made for the disabled occupant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By exempting the aged and disabled from the rigours of the test of financial resources, grant aid can be directed at improving their environment and life style. It is all too common to hear of older people living in conditions of abject misery because of their inability to seek aid to improve their lot. Further inquiries into their financial status will be regarded as particularly degrading and will act as a disincentive to the members of society that we wish to protect.

It will be an act of common decency for the Government to accept the amendment which introduces an element of care for the most disadvantaged in our society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Acton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly to amendment No. 552 and take up a point made by the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) about the disabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original proposition in the Green Paper was that the disabled would not be means tested for adaptations to their homes. That has now been changed and they will be means tested. In assessing their capacity to contribute we must remember that the disabled face additional costs. There are difficulties when a landlord has to make adaptations for a disabled tenant. The landlord is means tested on the cost of the work which is for the benefit of his tenant, and that landlord may resent the whole process.

Amendment No. 552 provides that if a person's income is less than the upper limit, he or she will receive a minimum 20 per cent. grant to help with the work. It is important to provide an incentive for householders to tackle serious disrepair in houses that are below the fitness standard, and to encourage them to put their money into repairs. That would overcome the means-testing problem mentioned by the hon. Member for City of Durham. If people know that they will get at least 20 per cent., they can get into the system secure in that knowledge, and knowing that they may be entitled to more if they reveal details of their income. That is more positive than the present system under which many people will get nothing. If a small grant is available by right and serves as an entry to the grant system, more people will be encouraged to repair their homes than would otherwise be the case. It would remove the stigma of means-tested grants and use the system to encourage take-up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal is consistent with the Government's intention of targeting grant on those in most need while encouraging investment in houses that are below the fitness standard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We share many of the aims of the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg). There is a difference in the way that we hope to achieve them, but there is no difference in our purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I believed that means testing for grants would inhibit the improvement of properties I would be much more anxious about it and would not impose it. However generous a Government—we all have different views about the generosity of Governments of different parties—there is a limit to the amount of money available for any part of a programme, as spokesmen on both sides of the House say constantly when they are in Government. We are anxious only that the money that we spend has the maximum possible advantage. Therefore, it is right that those who cannot afford to improve properties that are manifestly in need of improvement should be the first priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Means testing means that those who could not otherwise do what needs to be done get the money. That should be the basis on which we operate. The question thereafter is, "Are there ways in which special arrangements can be made for special groups who have particular needs?" The disabled are one group—perhaps the most important—to whom that might apply, as the hon. Member for City of Durham and my hon. Friend for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we can devise a satisfactory means of what is inelegantly referred to as passporting so that people who already receive benefits for which they have been tested will not have to undergo a further test of their income and available capital to get a grant. Obviously it would be better if they did not have to undergo a further test and we are seeking to ensure that that will not be necessary under the regulations that we shall introduce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the best use is made of the available money by providing a mandatory 20 per cent. That is not how I expect public money to be used. I have listened to other cases put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton, and I hope that he agrees that I have sought to accommodate him when his priorities were right, that is not a priority that I would choose because it would not have the effect that he supposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the suggestions of the hon. Member for City of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1066</span>
Durham are impracticable. The hon. Gentleman does not like means testing because he seek the country's housing stock as a national resource. I do not see it in those terms. Just as people have a right to own their home, they have a responsibility for it. I do not like the concept that the responsibility for upkeep should be a national one. It would be a short step from there to say that ownership was also national. Ownership is about responsibility as well as about privilege. Part of the country's malaise is that privilege and responsibility have been divided from each other. I do not go down the same road as the hon. Member for City of Durham, and I suspect that he would not go far down it himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for City of Durham then said that we should be concerned only with the income of spouses. I go part of the way with him on that. We intend to take account only of the incomes, of other people who live there but who are not dependants. We do not want people to be able to shift their incomes to others to pass the test—to get the money although they are in receipt of a considerable income. That would be unfair and I do not want to encourage it. I undertake not to provide an unfair system. It is merely that the regulations must protect against such shifting of income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a little concerned that the hon. Member for City of Durham wanted to deal only with spouses. Without wishing to be too indelicate, I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that we do not want a disincentive to marriage. Partners living together as man and wife should be covered. There is not much between us on that issue. There is a difference in exempting people because of age rather than ability to pay. I want the tests, not because I want to stop people having grants, but to ensure that every penny of grant is effectively used. I am anxious that we should help all those who could not otherwise help themselves. It would be rather odd to say that because people had reached a certain age they should have an altogether different view of their resources. I cannot be persuaded along that road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In producing the regulations, we shall seek to achieve the common end of ensuring that as high a proportion as possible of the money available will go to those who most need it and whose houses are clearly in need of repair. To do that, we hope to have as much passporting and as simple a system as possible. That is partly why we reject some of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea of a differential premium to take account of regional housing costs for types of property proposed in amendment No. 641 would be extremely complicated, so I find it difficult to go along with what the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) said in that regard. I believe that much of what he wants will be met by the regulations. He must accept that Conservative Members generally believe in the means testing of grants and do not agree that we should make a difference between people on grounds which have nothing to do with their means. We must make the difference between people on the ground of their means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Disabled people could claim grants for direct adaptations made in houses. It would not be a matter of their landlords carrying out the changes because the grants are for adaptations for the disabled persons who would be able to claim them. My hon. Friend the Minister for Ealing, Acton was right to point out that there is a clear difference between altering a house so that a disabled person may live in it and altering it to ensure that it is watertight and equipped with the proper facilities that are necessary for all people. The latter changes are of advantage to a landlord whereas changes made to adapt a house to disabled people might prove a disadvantage to a landlord, as the hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1008">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1067</span>
Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) said in relation to changes to council houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the Minister closely. He said that the regulations would provide a reason why certain grants should be made. Will he assure the Committee that the capital value of a house will not be used as a reason why grants should not be made? In other words, if a house is worth £20,000 or £25,000 and it is mortgaged under the present scheme whereby building societies will grant a mortgage only if it does not involve excessive repayments, will that be covered by the regulations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, the benefits are paid by the Department of Social Security. I ask the Minister for an assurance that elderly and disabled people will not find that the capital value of a house is offset against any grant that may be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are problems in certain regions, especially in the north in mining areas where British Coal has said that if any damage is caused to the structure of its properties after three, five or seven years, it will not accept responsibility. There could be problems in mining areas for elderly widows and widowers who live in their own houses if compensation for structural damage is not provided by British Coal. That circumstance could not occur in the south of England, so there is a need for the Minister to take note of those regional differences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In regard to the hon. Gentleman's second point, I agree that a person living in a house in such circumstances would be eligible, whereas a person living elsewhere where they did not occur would not. In that sense, there is a regional difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference is not so much a matter of region, except by accident as of circumstance. Certainly, I would not produce regulations which would stop people being eligible in those circumstances if the other elements of eligibility were present, so he may be reassured on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would not intend to take the capital value of a house into account because a person in it is trying not to realise its capital value but to mend it. If that person is unable to mend the house he will get help, but if he can mend it out of his own resources he will not. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we must not frame the rules so as to exclude him because he is in the house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those assurances and the further consultations that we intend to have with the associations — they wish to make many detailed points — I hope that the Committee will accept that the amendments are not suitable. We shall try to put into the regulations the elements that I have described and the requirements and requests that the associations may make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are aware that many people do not use improvement grants. Under the regulations, those who will benefit most from improvement grants will, in theory, be the worst off — the means test will ensure that they receive 10 per cent. grants — but the Department of the Environment document gives figures which show that approximately 45 per cent. of people who live in poor conditions have incomes of less than £3,000 a year. They are the least likely to carry out major renovations to their homes. The money that the Minister hopes to target at such properties will never reach the target. That is a fact of life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may have misunderstood the Minister's second point. A man and wife may have two wage-earning children whose
	<span class='label label-info column'>1068</span>
wages are taken into account. What will happen if the two children move out and the parents decide to sell the house and have to repay grant? Will the fact that the children have moved out be taken into consideration?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point is that the Minister said that it would be extremely difficult to implement amendment No. 641. I had the impression that he believed that it would be an administrative nightmare. I do not understand how that would be if housing costs were taken into account in the means test. People in areas of high housing cost would be compensated. That would not be difficult to administer. Grants would be distributed more fairly if the area in which people live, as well as their incomes, were considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should think again about his third proposition. It would be a great disincentive in the north and reduce the number of people who are going to the north in favour of the south-east where housing costs are higher. I am not sure that that is the effect that he wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is better to leave the provision as drafted. The local authority associations have much to offer, and will raise many of those issues during our discussions. We intend to be extremely open to the pressures that they may put on us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not like the clause, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are inherently opposed to the proposition that everything that involves the community and society warrants targeting. We have always accepted individual responsibility for oneself and one's family, and we encourage that, but that does not exclude responsibilities and obligations to the community and society. In yesterday's debate in the Chamber and in Committee today, we have discussed targeting. That can distort the achievement of a desired goal, whether it is child benefit or means testing. For the most basic provision of fit accommodation, the introduction of means testing can undermine the original intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A person has to be very poor or substantially well off to be able to renovate properties that lack basic amenities. Properties that lack basic amenities will either be fully funded by grant aid if the owners are badly off, or the mandatory provisions will fall so heavily on those who are just above the means test level that people will be precluded from affording the necessary renovations. People who are not desperately poor, but who cannot afford the considerable investment, will be hit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Means testing is doing that right across the board. It is catching people who are struggling to make ends meet — the ones about whom all parties have eulogised as they have saved and done their best to earn a living. They have been responsible for themselves and their families; they care about the environment and have made it possible for us to inherit the benefits of their foresight. That is important and the clause will make matters worse for them. That is why anxiety was expressed about age and not just income. We have an obligation to understand what happens to people now and in the future. We argued last week that we shall have a larger bill to pick up as a society if we do not consider that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Means testing will not achieve its goal as it will penalise those who cannot quite afford to make renovations but who are not badly enough off to benefit from the full grant. It will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1009">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1069</span>
ensure the gentrification or yuppification of properties that people cannot afford to improve but which they must sell on to those who can afford to do it, whether they be large property companies and developers or well-off people. That is the wrong direction to take and a damaging prospect for inner-city communities which should be keeping in the community people who can afford to renovate property, so that they can enjoy being part of that neighbourhood, rather than be forced to move out and be replaced by someone else who changes the nature of the environment and the social make-up of the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the grounds of equity, housing and the social and environmental nature of those areas which suffer most from the lack of basic amenities, we oppose the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett). He referred to inner cities in England; I shall refer to Wales. Clause 97 has been opposed by every organisation associated with the provision of housing in the Principality — district councils, their associations, the Institute of Housing in Wales, the environmental health officers and, most important, the thousands of people in the valleys of south Wales and elsewhere who are deeply hostile to the principle of means testing for improvement grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We agree with the Government's argument about simplicity. The present system is far too complex for people to understand and value, but we cannot have simplicity and means testing, which so many people in south Wales remember from their youth. Older houses in Wales are occupied mainly by elderly people whose memories go back to the means test. That is a major obstacle to the revitalisation of housing in the valleys of south Wales and other parts of the Principality. Older people are reluctant to take improvement grants, but if they have to face means testing, take-up throughout Wales will inevitably fall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot agree with the Minister that we must consider the matter in individual terms. We must deal with it in terms of society. I never thought that I would agree with the Building Employers Confederation, but it has rightly said that one must take into account an improvement grant to the house, as much as to the people living in it. All those houses added together make up communities, and unless those communities can be saved through improvement grants, they will suffer and, in parts of Wales, they will disappear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wrong to believe that, at present, poorer people do not get grants. We had a Welsh house condition survey, like the English. Their survey revealed that more than 80 per cent. of people who applied for grants were on relatively low incomes. It is much the same in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have yet to see the complexity of the regulations. The Minister says, "Watch out, boys — the regulations will be much fairer than the Bill", but he must convince us. If the regulations are geared to the housing benefit system, the associations are right to point out that the definition of earnings is too wide, the threshold for 100 per cent. grant is too low, and the rate at which the grant is reduced is too great. The result is that many thousands of people throughout the Principality will no longer be eligible. They will probably have to earn about £13,000 a year or less to qualify for a grant. People on average earnings with two children might get about £300-worth of grant for £4,000-worth of work on their house. That is no incentive to restore our older housing. Far from revitalising our valleys, it will be a death knell to them. I shall take great pleasure in voting against clause 97.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1070</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) says. It is a curious way of bringing into the discussion the means test that was conducted in the 1920s and 1930s in the valleys of Wales. We are not planning such means testing. We are dealing with the sort of means test that is part and parcel of the social security system and that is used, for example, when people are assessed for parental contribution to university fees. That is a reasonable measurement to determine whether they should receive public money — which is paid by people who are subject to a means test, called income tax arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not help the argument to hark back to an attitude that is entirely different from the generous way in which we think of such matters today. The real question is whether it is proper to tax people and give their money to other people, irrespective of the recipients' means. The suggestion here is that we should give not irrespective of means, but in accordance with means. That seems reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Presumably the Minister agrees that the aim of the clause and of the new development in improvement grants is to shift the balance from public grant aid to private finance, just as the Government are attempting to do with student loans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not referring to the means test in an emotional way in political terms. I was referring to the memories of the vast majority of the people in Wales who receive improvement grants. Most of the old terraced houses that we associate with the valleys are occupied by elderly people, especially in the north of the valleys. Such people remember the means test with great distaste.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the Minister may say, the word "generosity" is not often used by such people to describe the housing benefit system. That is the case with the present proposals, too. There will be a means test and the consultation papers suggest, as the regulations will probably reveal, many deeply disturbing details. People who are eligible and want improvement grants are unlikely to take them up because they find the prospect of means testing distasteful. Areas of older housing in Wales are bound to suffer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still find it curious to say that we should take money from people and give it to others irrespective of the recipients' means. The money that we gave would often be provided by people who are worse off than the recipients — people who are trying to solve their own family housing difficulties. It is better to target the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Torfaen is wrong in his assessment of what the clause is about. It is not about shifting the cost of housing improvements from public to private resources. It is about targeting public money on the people who most need it in the houses that should be improved. That is proper. Any other system is imprudent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is saying something more important than he realises. The Under-Secretary, too, has sometimes said the same, only to regret having said it. The Minister is saying that mortgage interest relief should be targeted. At present it is untargeted. The more one earns, the more one is given, and the money comes from everyone else. Mortgage interest relief breaches the principle that the Minister has twice spelt out to the Committee. Will he tell the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer to target that relief?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot stray into the realms of mortgage interest relief at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would indeed be wrong to stray into those realms, Mr. Hunt, because improvement grants take money from one person and give it to someone else. Mortgage interest relief kindly allows people to keep money that they already have, which they have earnt. Labour Members should learn the difference between allowing people to keep what is theirs, which the state would take from them, and the redistribution of income, which is what happens when money is taken from some and given to others. The fact that the Labour Party does not understand those elementary economics is one of the reasons why it has never been able to run a society effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What Labour Members are really interested in is stopping people keeping their money that they earn. We all know about the Labour party and mortgage interest relief. People who now have difficulty because of the high rate of interest would be in far greater difficulties if a Labour Government took away their right to use their money in that way. The Labour party is envious of any kind of personal responsibility, and of home ownership. That is why it fought so long to stop council house tenants buying their houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the clause is to target taxpayers' money on those who need it, and not on those who do not. I understand the hon. Gentleman's worry that there may be some people who are willing to improve their own property if the state, or the taxpayer, pays, but who are not willing if they have to pay themselves. The hon. Gentleman would say that it is so important to improve the housing stock that we do not want that argument to be used. My answer is that a society that sets out to say that the taxpayer must pay for everything which the taxpayer thinks is beneficial is just the sort of society that ends up going to the International Monetary Fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the difference between us. We believe that people need to be given the responsiblity of ownership and that they rise to that responsibility rather than fall away from it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a crippling responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seek to give to those who need and do not expect to take from others that which they cannot give. This is a proper and, I think, quite Socialist concept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is saying almost the exact opposite of what he is doing. He is taking money from people who do not have it, and giving it to those who have a great deal. His attempt to dodge the question does not work. His argument would mean that anyone who has paid tax over a period ought, when unemployed or on a low income, to start getting more help towards rent and other costs of living than he does under this Government. We should look at what a person gets back from the taxes that he has paid, in mortgage interest relief and in other forms of benefit. The overwhelming result is that, the richer the person, the greater his benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister dodges, constantly, the fact that the person on £150,000 a year receives more from the taxpayer than the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1072</span>
person on £15,000 or £25,000 a year, let alone someone on less. The Minister cannot pretend that he does not want to hear that argument; the principles of targeting that he has enunciated apply to mortgage interest relief. He knows it and the Chancellor of the Exchequer knows it. The Chancellor of the Exchequer will not raise the basic limit because he knows what the implications would be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A previous Conservative spokesman on housing, when speaking of just the principle that the Minister enunciated, said that his party would make the building societies keep their mortgage interest rates to 9.5 per cent. or below, because it would not run the economy with high interest rates. The Prime Minister echoed that, yet the Government have failed abysmally. With measures like this, they take money from people on low incomes who paid taxes at various times in their careers, and go on giving it to people on high incomes. That is not targeting. That is what is wrong with the clause, and that is why we will vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment can be moved and, I believe, responded to briefly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 98 deals with landlords who apply for improvement grants. The amendment covers the landlord with a tenant who, for whatever reason, rents a property not a market rent but at a registered rent. As the Bill stands, when a local authority assesses a landlord's ability to pay the cost of the improvement, it has to take into account the amount of rent that he might get on the basis he's getting an open market rent under an assured tenancy.

The landlord may be unable to charge a market rent. If the letting has a registered rent he must let it on that basis, which reduces his ability to finance the improvement of his property. The amendment seeks only to allow the local authority to take that factor into account when assessing the grant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to draw the Committee's attention to the problems with the fitness standards in the Bill. It is extraordinary that the 1936 standards, which drew substantially on the public health standards laid down in the 19th century, are not only still being used but are being diluted in terms of the basic acceptable fitness of property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is amazing that the provision of an inside toilet is not considered a basic amenity. In 1989, when we are debating ecology and the future of the planet, it is incredible that energy conservation through insulation is not considered a basic requirement. Local and central government have spent a great deal of time, money and effort to persuade people to insulate their homes, yet a basic standard of insulation is not built into the fitness standards. It is extraordinary that basic soundproofing is not standard. We consider it fundamental to the fitness of a dwelling, given the enormous social and health problems that the lack of it causes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extraordinary also that we cannot make up our minds about whether basic electric wiring and the provision of water in a dwelling should be included in the fitness standards. It is remarkable that standards that are agreed by the local authority associations and the Institute of Environmental Health Officers have not been built into the Bill. I raise this issue because it is fundamental to the way in which we apply the grant structure and the tests, and because we intended to seek to amend the clause. Unfortunately, the amendment was not selected. We did not have the opportunity to tell the Government of our concern and to put on record, as I now do, our feeling that in 1989 we should grasp the opportunity to update fitness standards which we have drawn upon from the 19th century, to take account of the era into which we are moving, and to incorporate provisions that would be the basis for the future and would show the foresight of which we spoke earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to reassure the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) that, contrary to what he believes, the fitness standard is not being diluted; in fact, it is being increased. The fitness standard is defined in section 604 of the Housing Act 1985 as amended by paragraph 47 of schedule 8 of the Bill. The revised standard is broadly similar to the existing standard but includes for the first time provision for heating and basic amenities such as a WC and a bath or shower. Grant will be available towards work required to meet any single criterion in the standard or a combination of criteria. Hon. Members will appreciate that the fitness standard now has a dual rule. It provides a yardstick for assessing entitlement to mandatory grant; it also continues to act as a trigger for enforcement action by local authorities. We framed the revised standard with that in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Discretionary approval of certain applications.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 756, in page 	<b>84,</b> line 	<b>48,</b> at end insert—

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it may be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 649, in page 	<b>87,</b> line 	<b>7,</b> at end insert:—

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I move amendment No. 756 as the nominated subcontractor of my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham), who has provided the detailed specifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment extends home improvement grants to electrical work. At present, electrical work scores only when
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1012">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1075</span>
it is part of a general improvement of the building; it does not score if it is the only work that needs to be done. It is an anomaly that the amendment would correct. If one had a property that was sound but had dangerous electrical wiring, a grant would be given under the amendment — subject of course, to means testing, and so on — to put the wiring right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are good safety arguments to support the amendment because out-of-date wiring needs attention, but it presents a problem for people who have low incomes and no assets. To include rather than exclude electrical work would go with the grain of the Government's general policy, and that is the purpose of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 649 proposes to delete paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of subsection (2). The adoption of the new fitness standards was referred to in our debate on clause 99, when the Minister drew attention to schedule 8. But that schedule does not greatly change what happens now. My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) said that the present standards for approval of grants were set way back in the 1930s. But the Bill should be looking forward to the projected standards in the 1990s and the year 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) provides that the purposes for which grant shall be approved are:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(a) to put the dwelling in reasonable repair".</p></blockquote>
One can accept that.
	<br><blockquote><p>"(b) to provide the dwelling by the conversion of a house or other building".</p></blockquote>
That is reasonable. But it then adds:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) to provide adequate thermal insulation;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(d) to provide adequate facilities for space heating;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(e) to provide satisfactory internatal arrangements".</p></blockquote>
For those to be the qualifications for obtaining grant is, in our view, not in the best interests of property or of the future, because we feel that they should be part of the standard of the dwelling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A report published by the Association of Metropolitan Authorities in 1986 listed 18 items that should constitute the standard of dwellings. Little progress has been made since that time in revising standards. The fact that the Government took no notice of that report underlines the point that the proposals in schedule 8 and the clause, would not enhance or improve standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ask why categories (c), (d) and (e) are not included in the fitness standard test. Will the Minister tell us why the standards to attract improvement and repair grants have been dropped?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 650 seeks to insert two additional paragraphs after paragraph (g). Paragraph (h) seeks
	<br><blockquote><p>"to provide for such adaptations for the physically handicapped as may from time to time be so specified by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
We hope that the Government's new approach to people being transferred from mental hospitals and institutions back into the community will mean that the Secretary of State will examine the circumstances of those people and, by regulation, adapt the conditions attached to the Bill to specify needs and to help the housing adaptations required for the physically handicapped. New paragraph (h) covers the position and is in the best interests of people who need — as the Minister said earlier — assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To follow that, we suggest new paragraph (i)—
	<span class='label label-info column'>1076</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"to provide for such works as may be considered to be of a minor nature as may for the time being be so specified."</p></blockquote>
Elderly and mentally and physically disabled people should lead as near normal life as possible. I believe there is no division in Committee about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that in mind, we have suggested that dwellings to which the disabled have been accustomed, which are provided by relatives and friends, may need minor works for which a minor grant should be given. People cannot afford a major capital contribution, which is why provision should be made to provide a minor grant to benefit the elderly and low-income owners who may otherwise find it difficult to arrest deterioration of their dwellings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a person applies for a grant, a scheme is submitted to the local authority for consideration and an officer of the local authority, or an architect if one is involved, examines the dwelling and lists what is required to bring it up to the standard which is suggested in schedule 8. In the main, the dwellings are old, and many defects are listed for which grant can be paid. That may not always please the owner. If the capital cannot be raised the owner may be deterred from accepting a grant. A grant—for example, an insulation grant or a grant for electrical rewiring — for minor work could help owners in those circumstances. The Minister should give favourable consideration to the introduction of a minor works grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The removal of restrictions such as the eligible expenses limits and the date that the dwelling was built should be considered. In some cases involving an elderly person on a low income, the resources available to that owner occupier may have to be taken into account when the grant is considered. We hope that a 75 per cent. or 100 per cent. grant can be paid to such people so that they can ensure that their property is adequately maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, as the Minister for Local Government said, it is the Government's intention to target resources to those in the greatest need, people of low means with no capital investment and no savings will have to reject the offer of a grant if it is not for 75 per cent. or 100 per cent. Many people will be caught in those circumstances, and I hope that the Minister will take them into account. They will find it difficult to raise the capital to meet the extra costs if they do not get a 75 per cent. or 100 per cent. grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 651 seeks to add a further subsection, (5) (c) which would state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall have regard to the age and physical and mental health of the applicant."</p></blockquote>
There would be little sense in a local authority insisting that major improvements are carried out before a grant can be offered if, because of a person's age, or physical or mental disabilities, he or she would suffer hardship created by a major disturbance in the property. The amendment would mean that the age and health of the applicant would be taken into consideration. In such circumstances, only minor improvements or adaptations would apply. The owner would have the benefit of a grant to improve the property as necessary to ensure that it is fit for human habitation but not have to endure the major upheaval that a local authority might consider necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are constructive, as they would benefit disabled and elderly people. We ask the Minister to accept them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1077</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree that the amendments are constructive. Indeed, I believe that they would cause damage, and I shall try briefly to explain why. First, the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) anticipates a discussion on the new fitness standard that the Committee will have when we reach schedule 8. Including the three factors which he catalogued and are referred to in the amendment, the basic standard would impose a duty on local authorities to insist on such items as space heating and, adequate thermal insulation. That would mean that many more properties would be subject to enforcement action. It would be taken against many people, including the majority of those in this Room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a well-known fact that there are far more wealthy Members of Parliament on the Labour Benches than on the Conservative Benches. A number of millionaires chose to join the Labour party because they find it easier to be a bigger duck in a smaller pond and to climb the ladder of success. The Committee has heard of the difficulties experienced by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government when dashing around his house clad in woolly jumpers in his attempts to keep warm. Is the hon. Member for Normanton seriously suggesting to the Committee that the facilities referred to in the clause should become commonplace?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are they commonplace in his house?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that they are not in mine, and that proves that there are more wealthy Labour Members than Conservative Members. The suggestion is ridiculous. It would mean that enforcement action would follow when a house was not up to the basic fitness standard. Local authorities would have to take action against what, I repeat, would be the majority of members of the Committee, especially those on the Government Front Bench. The idea is nonsense as it cannot possibly be carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's point about disabled people was well made but we have already met it with new clauses 8 and 10, which make provision for grants for those purposes. For disabled people, there is provision for a mandatory grant as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the Minister should try to defend his position by saying that adequate thermal insulation should not be included as part of the required standard of a dwelling because a condition of all new dwellings is that proper thermal insulation must be provided. The Minister is saying that it should be a qualification for obtaining grant. He mentioned also adequate facilities for space heating. Surely, in 1989 and 1990 space heating and central heating should form part of the required standard of property. If the Minister is denying that, where does he intend to take us in our discussion of housing?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are not pie-in-the-sky suggestions but matters that form basic standards of property. The Minister should recognise that this is a serious issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister and the Government have recognised needs in that respect by making it clear in the clause that discretionary grants are available for such matters. The difference between the hon. Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>1078</span>
Normanton and me is that he thinks that the facilities should be regarded as basic needs in every home, but we are not discussing new homes when talking about those forms of grants. The majority of houses that we are discussing are pretty elderly. Although it might be commonplace in Normanton and Wakefield to have such facilities, that is not the case throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should like to help to bring properties up to a specific standard, but let us not make that the minimum fitness standard for mandatory grants. The money would be spread incredibly thinly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have added to the list, as we should. But, with respect, is the hon. Gentleman really suggesting that space heating should be included? We are not discussing new properties. The homes of most members of the Committee do not have that facility. We are not saying that improvements should not be made or that assistance should not be given. Otherwise, we would not have included the provision—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Irvine Patnick 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hallam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under subsection (2)(a) the application may be approved if its purpose is
	<br><blockquote><p>"to put the dwelling in reasonable repair". I remember from my days as a builder the words "at reasonable cost". Those words are missing from the provision.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good example. I am especially grateful to my hon. Friend for drawing attention to subsection (2)(a):
	<br><blockquote><p>"to put the dwelling in reasonable repair".</p></blockquote>
What is the definition of "reasonable repair"? The suggestion is that some items should be removed from the clause and put into the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the perception of the hon. Member for Normanton of what is normal is not mine. I suggest that the majority of housing stock would not fall into the categories in the clause. We agree that assistance should be given, but we believe that it should be provided by discretionary grants, not mandatory grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) spoke on behalf of our hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham). I agree that discretionary grants should be available for electrical repairs and rewiring. I shall write to my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East this evening to assure him that clause 100(2) as drafted would permit that. Rewiring, especially when existing wiring is unsafe, is an element of putting a property "in reasonable repair" and may be associated with the provision of heating. It should not be listed as a separate purpose and I shall try to convince my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton that to do so would cast doubt on the eligibility of other types of work required to put a property "in reasonable repair" that are not mentioned specifically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.45pm.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 553, in page 	<b>88,</b> line 	<b>10,</b> leave out:
	<br><blockquote><p>'the expected life of the building'</p></blockquote>
and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'extending the life of the building by 30 years'.</p></blockquote>
This is a probing amendment. Section 468 (2)(d) of the Housing Act 1985 requires a local authority to be sure that proposed works are likely to provide satisfactory housing accommodation for a period of 30 years. There is no mention in the Bill of a similar provision. The local authority is required only to
	<br><blockquote><p>"have regard to the expected life of the building".</p></blockquote>
It is the view of the industry, especially the National Home Improvement Council, that the inclusion of a specific period of time—30 years or longer—has proved a useful assessment under current legislation and should be retained. There is some criticism that the 30-year rule has been applied too inflexibly and that some improvements have been found ineligible even if necessary in the short term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State, through the use of guidance notes, can clarify the position with local authorities. The NHIC believes that it is essential to include the concept of long-term improvements in primary legislation. Discretion will be available for special circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be equally brief. One of the criticisms of the existing grant system has been the requirement that improvement-grant-aided properties should have a 30-year life expectancy. We believe that that has been too inflexible and has precluded some worthwhile shorter-term improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has created, too, an atmosphere in which other options, such as selected clearance, have been difficult to consider. Clause 100 (3) deliberately does not repeat that requirement. Clearly, it would be a waste of money to give a grant towards work to a property that will have less than the 30-year life currently required. For conversions and properties that are part of a group repair scheme, a 30-year life is appropriate. We prefer horses for courses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision is designed to give maximum flexibility to cater for a wide range of circumstances and works that are
	<span class='label label-info column'>1080</span>
relevant to discretionary grants. Having said that, I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<b>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</b></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 652 in page 88, line 25, leave out subsection (6) and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'(6) In the exercise of the powers conferred by paragraphs (f) and (g) of subsection (2) above the Secretary of State may specify requirements generally or for particular cases.'.</p></blockquote>
Subsection (6) of the clause states that the Secretary of State
	<br><blockquote><p>"may specify requirements generally or for particular cases; and (b) may specify different requirements for different areas."</p></blockquote>
Why is that subsection in the Bill? It will mean that the Secretary of State can channel resources away from certain areas and authorities, which would be unfair. It would be cruel, dishonest and devastating, and would distress those involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That provision would mean that some of the inner-city areas, especially central London, could attract the major share of available resources to the detriment of urban and rural areas, which would not be in the best interests of those who would qualify for grants but would not receive them because the resources had been channelled elsewhere. Subsection (6) should be replaced with the wording that is suggested in the amendment. Different requirements for different areas may prevent some local authorities from considering discretionary grants, should financial resources be available after dealing with the mandatory grants. Anomalies could arise if the clause remains in its present form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1081</span>
that there are particular problems in his constituency, as he knows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The discretion that we seek to leave with the Secretary of State could help with certain problems. It will be fascinating to see whether the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) will break the habit of a lifetime and vote with the Government. I could carry him with me if he could understand that there are certain problems in certain areas, regions, subregions or constituencies that do not occur elsewhere. He has been a vociferous and able advocate for homes that have been adversely affected by radon, for example. He would wish the Secretary of State to retain the powers enshrined in the Bill, so we face the pleasurable experience of seeing the hon. Member for Truro voting with the Government. It would be uncharacteristic and against his religion or his party's principles, but I invite him to vote with the Government. I beg the hon. Member for Normanton to press the amendment to a Division so that we can see what happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton should welcome the fact that the Secretary of State will have this form of discretion. We have debated several times today whether the Secretary of State should have such power, so I do not propose to argue the Government's case again. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what the Minister said. He is correct. I accept that there are various problems that need special attention, and radon gas is perhaps the least of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The worry that has been expressed is that there is a discretionary power to reduce provision, as well as to increase it. In her comments the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Surrey, South-West (Mrs. Bottomley), was unable to satisfy me that that was not the position. If the Minister could do so, I should be delighted. I have no doubt that it is possible to extend provision. My worry is not extension, as I believe that that is necessary. I am worried that the power could equally be used to reduce provision. If it would not, I would support what the Minister says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an inappropriate intervention. Such a power, when vested in legislation of this sort can, of course, be exercised either way, but the principal reason for including the power in the Bill is to assist areas that are adversely affected. I have given the hon. Gentleman one example, and there are others in say, mining closure areas, where houses are adversely affected. I have had experience in my constituency of buildings falling down slopes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Truro must not try to escape this golden opportunity of voting with the Government by giving the Committee reasons for not doing so. That is not a reasonable intervention, nor is it a good enough excuse for him to get out of voting with the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difficulty is that neither the hon. Gentleman nor his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Surrey, South-West (Mrs. Bottomley) has given any commitment that the Government will not use the power to reduce the available provision. If the power were a discretionary power to extend the provision, I would be wholeheartedly in favour of it for the reasons that the Minister has given. The problem is that that is not what the subsection provides; it gives power to the Minister to extend or to reduce the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government had a record of always using such power to extend provision, there would be no difficulty in
	<span class='label label-info column'>1082</span>
supporting them in this instance. In my experience, however, these powers tend to be used as an excuse to reduce provision, so I face a serious difficulty. I do not ask for the legislation to be changed, but if the Minister could reassure us that the Government have no intention of reducing, and cannot foresee the circumstances in which they would reduce the availability of help, I would not support the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) in pressing his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman checks the 	<i>Hansard</i> report tomorrow, he will see that he has just said "if … the Government cannot foresee the circumstances". My answer to that condition is that I cannot foresee such circumstances. Therefore, I hope that he will now support us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister does not convince anyone with his rhetoric. He has given no assurance to the hon. Minister for Truro (Mr. Taylor) or to Labour Members. I learnt from my experience when the Minister visited my constituency and we asked for levelling up. The Minister was in another Department then and we were asking for the same industrial development grants as were available in other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for the Environment will certainly use this provision to the disadvantage of authorities, so I cannot accept the Minister's argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>'(1) A local housing authority shall, by notice in writing, notify an applicant for a grant as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event, not later than six months after the date of the application concerned—
	<ol>
	<li>in the case of a mandatory grant, whether the application is approved or refused; and</li>
	<li>in the case of a discretionary grant, whether the application is being considered and when and how a decision is to be made.'.</li></ol></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 101 deals with the response that local authorities have to give to applicants for mandatory or discretionary grants. Amendment No. 653 proposes a two-tier alternative; where the grant is mandatory, a response has to be given within six months; where it is discretionary, a response must be given showing the likely waiting time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first alternative must surely be acceptable to the Government, as it imposes a condition on local government and increases the duty on local authorities to ensure that applicants for mandatory grants receive a quicker response. It should not be too difficult, as at present one in four people is eligible for grants, while under the new system the proportion will be one in nine and local authorities should be able to respond more quickly and tell the applicants whether they can get mandatory grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New subsection (1)(b) would prevent applicants from having continually to reapply for discretionary grants, as they would have to under the clause as currently drafted. The local authority would be able to say that it approved the grant in principle and that when the Government supplied

	<p>7pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with what the hon. Member for Torvaen (Mr. Murphy) has said, but 12 months seems an unreasonable length of time to allow the local authority to make up its mind. The tight regime under the right to buy, for example, rightly requires the local authority to reply within four weeks to the RTB1. If a local authority can do that, I do not see why it cannot make up its mind on improvement grants, if not within a month at least within three months or, as my amendment says, six months—that should be the maximum period. I shall take some persuading that we should let the Bill pass through Committee while it allows local authorities 12 months to decide. An estimate, as my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patrick) will tell the Committee, normally applies for three months, so if the authority does not reply within three months the applicant will have to obtain another estimate from the contractor. Rightly, we are pressing local authorities to deal with planning applications within 13 weeks, so why are they allowed 12 months to decide on this matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The intention is that local authorities should spend only three months in making the decisions. The decisions are of great importance to landlords, tenants and all those who hoped to proceed with work. The question is at what point we should require the local authority to have made the decision. We believe that there should be a time limit for deciding applications but we are not convinced that it would be realistic to insist on that limit being less than 12 months, as the two amendments would require. That would be the position for mandatory grants, at least.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always find that a limit will become the rule rather than the exception. Some authorities will take 12 months rather than three. As the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) will tell us, some of the right-to-buy purchases in Sheffield are taking a hell of a time because the council claims that is has to prepare a block plan. Those plans are repetitive; all that has to be done is to draw a red line around the area. Twelve months is far too long. I ask the ministerial team to reconsider the limit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the united views of the Committee. We are aware that the new system requires authorities to give more attention to the works included in the application—their cost and whether renovation is appropriate. That is quite apart from the consideration of the applicant's income and resources. We are monitoring the new system and we shall shortly discuss those matters with the local authority associations. It is not possible to accept the amendments now, but we shall make strong representations to the local authority associations on the matter. There is certainly merit in the idea that notification of progress should be given to applicants, as amendment No. 653 would provide for discretionary grants, so I give an undertaking that we shall consider how that could be done. But we cannot lift the formal 12-month limit at present. As I have repeatedly said, we shall issue guidance, and we expect such questions to be decided within three months. I hope that with that undertaking, and the undertaking that we shall have further discussion with the local authority associations, the amendments will not be pressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not press my amendments. I hope that the Minister will meet the associations. After all, they, too, are concerned about a 12-month limit. If it can make it shorter, all the better.

I shall be interested to hear the Minister admit that the new system will be much more bureaucratic and costly. I hope that when she meets the associations she can give local authorities extra money to make the system more effective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether my hon. Friend believes her brief and that local authorities need 12 months in which to make up their minds. If we make the period six months and they cannot make up their minds within that time, they have only to say no. We are not suggesting that they must say yes. Local authorities do not need 12 months. If they are allowed to take 12 months many of them will, and the decision time will drift up as it does with the three months allowed for planning decisions. Unless my hon. Friends on the Government Front Bench say that the Government will insert six months on Report, my inclination is to try to get six months now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only assure my hon. Friend that we shall meet local authority associations soon and press them strongly on this issue.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have already been coersive with the right to buy, where we have set tight timetables.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can say only that I welcome the Committee's belief that decisions can be made within six months.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The result of the Division on amendment No.554 was most interesting. I sincerely hope that the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) has no amendment up his sleeve now, as this is a probing amendment. Will the Minister say what the Secretary of State's colours are likely to be on the decision to set a limit on the maximum grant that councils should pay. Why is it necessary for the Secretary of State to have that power? If works are required to bring a property up to standard, why should there be a ceiling on the support offered? In what circumstances could the powers be used? Does the Secretary of State plan to set limits immediately, and what might the limits be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have swept away many requirements and restrictions that related to limits placed on age and rateable value, as well as to eligible expense. We rely much more on the proposed test of resources to deliver the necessary grants. The new system does have some uncertainties, however, not least the way in which some of the powers will be exercised in relation to very large properties. Clause 101(4) will enable the Secretary of State to set the maximum amount of grant that an authority may pay, should it prove necessary. The amendment would remove that power altogether. Although we have no present plans to prescribe an amount, it is important to retain a long-stop as a necessary precaution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to withdraw the amendment on the basis of further discussion. I hope that the Minister will have discussions with the associations on possible ceilings. My hon. Friends and I are deeply troubled by the amount of reserve power that the Secretary of State will have. I hope that the powers will not be used as the years roll by. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No.320, in page 	<b>89,</b> line 	<b>11,</b> at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(3A) If after an application for a grant has been approved, the authority is satisfied that, owing to circumstances beyond the control of any person described in section 97(3) their income, assets, needs or outgoings have changed, the authority may increase the amount of the grant.'</p></blockquote>
The amendment comes of the lineage of the Institute of Housing. It covers the possibility—some would say the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1086</span>
certainty — that the circumstances of a grant recipient can change. Although there may be problems in reassessing grant, the institute believes that there is a need for authorities to be able to reassess entitlement while work is in progress if an applicant's financial circumstances worsen significantly. We envisage that a grant would be fixed on the basis of earnings, but an applicant who suffered permanent disablement and a significant and permanent drop in household income would be unable to escape the financial consequences of the improvement work. It is suggested that there should be a power to enable local authorities to assess grant entitlement in such circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are sympathetic to the amendment. In normal circumstances, an authority will approve grant shortly after the resources test has been applied. There are occasions when, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire) said, the financial circumstances of the applicant may suffer significantly. Clause 101 allows local authorities to reassess costs and grant payable if unexpected additional works are necessary or if, unavoidably, the original estimate cannot be adhered to: These personal circumstances are not dissimilar. On the other hand, we are worried that a discretionary power to reassesss an applicant's resources may not be exercised even handedly, although a duty might lead to automatic reassessment, even for minor changes in income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of whether the amount of grant should be reduced if an applicant suddenly gains a substantial increase in income. Either way, there is potentially a large increase in the administrative burden on a local authority, and considerable scope for dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are sympathetic to the thought behind the amendment and would like to consider further what can practicably be done to meet the concern.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 657 gives local authorities the power to waive the requirement for repayment of grant or a proportion of the grant in cases of hardship. It applies to landlords in this case, because basically the clause does not apply to tenants. If a landlord runs into financial problems and has to sell the property, the local authority should have some discretion as to whether to insist on full or part repayment. I hope that the Government will accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 661 is based on the same argument, but applies to an owner-occupier. It is an owner-occupiers' clause. The case for this amendment is even stronger, because it is quite possible for an owner-occupier to be unable to pay his mortgage, for the mortgage to be foreclosed and for him to find himself in difficulty with the mortgage company. Such difficulties are hardly surprising, bearing in mind the Government's interest rate policy, and I therefore hope that the local authority will be allowed discretion. I urge the Minister to grant a bit more flexibility and to allow local authorities discretion in ordering either part or all of the repayment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can help the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley), certainly in relation to owner-occupiers. We have not decided on the figure or figures, but I can assure the Committee that we arenot seeking to restrict the freedom of grant recipients to move home as and when they wish. The clause will be triggered only when the property is sold above a prescribed amount, and the prescribed amount will be fixed at a level that meets our aim of securing repayments only where there is a strong likelihood of there being a large capital gain within a short time of grant being paid. There will be that flexibility.

We have tried in clause 105 to differentiate between landlords who sell with vacant possession and those who sell with tenants. I believe that the possibility of hardship arising in the way that the hon. Member for Hammersmith suggests is much less because of that differentiation, but we shall review the situation if there is any such evidence once the new system is in operation. We would have the powers, therefore, to operate in the same way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have wholly protected the owner-occupier in this respect, and the distinction between the two kinds of sales in the case of landlords goes a long way towards meeting the hon. Gentleman's wishes. I give him an undertaking that we shall look carefully lest any hardship arises once the system comes into operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments seek to strengthen the provisions for repayment of repair grant should an owner-occupier dispose of his property before an agreed period. As drafted, clause 106(2) requires owner-occupiers to repay the grant if the property is disposed of within three years. The amount to be repaid reduces by one third for each complete year since the grant was made. Subsection (3) places a local land charge on the property for three years from the date of the grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strengthened amendment we have tabled to subsection (2) increases the period in which repayment is necessary, should the property be disposed of, from three to five years. The amount to be repaid therefore reduces by one fifth for each complete year. The owner must pay compound interest on the amount to be repaid at a reasonable rate to be determined by the local housing authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment to subsection (3) is consequential and increases the period during which a local land charge is placed upon a property from three to five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a way, this is the opposite of the case that I made before because we should recognise that people may take advantage of the arrangement. For example, someone could buy a cheap, run-down property, obtain a repair grant, do it up and sell it. The amendment gives a stronger level of control and operates as a deterrent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us why he changed the repayment period from five to three years? Has he taken into account the problem of take-up, which might be affected? Is the Minister suggesting, by making the change, that there is, or could be, abuse of the new system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with the comments made by the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley). We are talking about people who are given a grant because they do not have much money. The idea that the people who are given grants would buy a house and do what the hon. Gentleman suggests is surprising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My concern is not to put people off by tying them to a place by the penal system that the hon. Gentleman proposes. The suggestion for compound interest to be paid is very tough, and not helpful in any way. I think that three years is a sufficient deterrent. We have a reasonable balance, which we should stick to, and three years fits in more sensibly with the means-tested grant about which we are speaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>'(f) A disposal of the whole of the dwelling, in cases of infirmity, necessitating accommodation with special care.'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to protect the interests of people who, by infirmity, are forced to sell their homes and move into accommodation with special care. That is a traumatic experience in itself for anyone, and the worry of having to pay back a grant as well will only increase the trauma and worry. To remove part of the basis of their financial support for the rest of their lives, after infirmity has removed them from their houses, would be a cruel act. I use the O'Brienism, "cruel", in the real sense of the word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Residential care of sheltered housing is an expensive commodity. "Old people who move into it need all the money that they can get to pay for it. If they do not have enough money, the taxpayer has to subsidise it, so it is just as expensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If people can no longer look after themselves without needing special care, they should not be treated in a way that adds to their burden. The amendment does not seek to subsidise people so that they can make vast profits from the grant system.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 110 deals with the contributions made by the Secretary of State. The Minister and other Conservative members of the Committee may disagree, but we believe that decent housing is the responsibility of Government. Good housing is part of the community structure that is necessary if any country is to function effectively. If the Minister is to take powers to force local authorities to bear some of the costs, we must ask whether he believes that there should be a grant system. If the Government believe that grants are necessary to maintain, improve and develop the housing stock, why are they not prepared to put their hands in their pocket? There is a strong case for the grant being 100 per cent. If the Minister does not agree with that and wants the local authorities to pay for it, what are the criteria for deciding what local authorities should pay? What consultation will there be on that subject with local authorities, given that the Secretary of State will have powers to vary conditions from one area to another?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want assurances on the Minister's powers under subsection (3) to make determinations which vary according to the authority. Can he tell us whether he expects to use his power and if so, on what criteria he will base his decisions? We fear that if the Secretary of State does not like the political policies of the local authority he will take more punitive action than he otherwise would. That is what the Government have done so far. Why should one authority receive greater contributions than another? There is no justification for it. If the Government believe in grants, they should be prepared to fund them, and it is important that they do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear from the speech made by the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) that there is a clear difference of opinion between the Opposition and the Conservative side of the Committee. We have been round this track at least four times today, so I hope that he will seriously consider pressing the matter to a Division as on this occasion the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) may vote with Conservative Members. I am sorry that this is the second time that I have sought that, but the hon. Member for Hammersmith will recall that his hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) disfranchised the hon. Member for Truro merely because he was not prepared to press the matter to a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have nothing to add. Obviously, the hon. Gentleman is right to say that housing is a national responsibility. He and I do not agree that circumstances may mean that certain areas must be treated in different ways. Rather than have him jump to the conclusion that some local authorities may have money taken from them, I assure him that the Secretary of State may wish to advance an increased sum for a local authority area. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman will not accept my assurance on that matter but I gave an example to the hon. Member for Truro and think that the Committee should divide on the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is disingenuous of the Minister to adopt that attitude, but that is how the Government operate.

The Government are far from convinced that they want a grant system to operate and I suspect that they will continue to whittle away at what has already been whittled away in the Bill. That is why so many people are suspicious of their

This is an interesting clause and I assume that St. Gummer will respond when I have finished. As it stands, clause 114 exempts from the provisions of clauses 93 and 94.
	<br><blockquote><p>"an application for a grant in respect of glebe land or the residence house of an ecclesiastical benefice made, during a period when the benefice is vacant, by a sequestrator of the profits of the benefice".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 93 provides that a local authority cannot give a grant unless the applicant is a present or intended owner or tenant. The hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) asks what that means. That is precisely what I want to learn from the Minister. It seems that the Government may hand out freebie glebies, because glebes appear to be exempted from some of the stringent requirements of part VIII. We want to know why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the fractured relationship between the Conservative party and the Church of England, previously regarded as the Tory party at prayer and now regarded by Conservative Members as the KGB at prayer, I am surprised that the Government are prepared to be so generous to the Bishop of Durham and his ilk. What is the reason for the proposal? The clause is barefaced cheek. It is intolerable to the Opposition that the sequestrator will cream off the profift from glebes and benefices and, at the same time, apply for grants from local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier we discussed the fact that local authorities would not receive grants for property that they own. We also discussed other organisations, such as urban development corporations. The Church will be treated favourably. I do not know whether that is an attempt by the Minister to crawl back into favour with the Almighty after the damage that he is rendering to the Almighty's flock on earth, or whether it is a sign of a change of attitude by the Government and that peace has broken out between the Church and No. 10 Downing street. I should be grateful if the Prime Minister's vicar on earth would reply to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To use the words of the hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>1093</span>
scored a direct hit with the amendment. We, too, are dissatisfied with the way the clause is drafted. The hon. Gentleman identified a genuine problem in the clause. Under the Housing Act 1985, the amount of grant payable is not associated with the title certificate provided, but many of the provisions in part VIII of the Bill hinge on the title certificate provided. I am prepared to reconsider the matter and to return to the House on Report with a new provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is to open up an opportunity for those who are dissatisfied to obtain a review of a decision under this part of the Bill. It provides them with a right to make representations on the authority's decision. The amendment would allow people to question a decision and that is entirely reasonable. When means testing takes place it is inevitable that there will be dissatisfaction with the decisions, regardless of the decisions on the specific work to be undertaken and whether such work is covered by the Bill. I hope that the Minister will respond positively to an amendment that is intended not to disrupt the Bill but to protect individual rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not disagree more with the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor). Under the existing system, which I believe does not need to be changed, if an applicant is dissatisfied with a decision, he has an opportunity to approach the official concerned for an explanation of how the decision was reached. If he is still dissatisfied, he may go to his elected representative—his local councillor—and in some circumstances to his Minister of Parliament. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman and I share that experience. If the applicant still receives no satisfaction, he has a right to claim that there has been maladministration and the matter may be referred to the ombudsman. If he does not wish to take that course or is dissatisfied with the ombudsman's decision, he may seek judicial review in the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will wish to divide the Committee on that issue, but I must say to him that the present system has worked perfectly satisfactorily and I am not prepared to encumber the existing legislation with more bureaucracy that would make it that much more difficult for those seeking grants to get them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a deeply unsatisfactory reply. I am surprised at the Minister. There will be a means test on the eligibility for grants. Hon. Members must be aware of the difficulties, complaints and uncertainty that that may cause. The processes to which the Minister referred are equally applicable to many of the other problems that arise with housing benefit or DSS problems when such appeals or
	<span class='label label-info column'>1094</span>
review procedures are available. There is a close link with the DSS and its procedures and the sort of difficulties that could arise under the Bill's provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised by the Minister's reaction. I shall press the amendment to a Division, and I hope that other members of the Committee will support it. The Minister deserves a shot across his bows for being so unwilling to recognise that there might be a problem and for claiming that a protection will be provided by the ombudsman and judicial review as there is no review process in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>'(1) A local housing authority shall not approve an application for a disabled facilities grant unless they are satisfied—

	<li>that it is reasonable and practicable to carry out the relevant works, having regard to the age and condition of the dwelling;</li></ol>
and in considering the matters specified in paragraph (a) above, the local housing authority shall consult the welfare authority.</p>
	<p>(2) Subject to the preceding provisions of this Part, a local housing authority shall approve an application for a disabled facilities grant if the relevant works are for any one or more of the following purposes—
	<ol>
	<li>facilitating access by the disabled occupant to and from the dwelling or the building in which the dwelling is situated;</li>
	<li>facilitating access by the disabled occupant to a room used or usable as the principal family room;</li>
	<li>facilitating access by the disabled occupant to a room used or usable for sleeping;</li>
	<li>facilitating access by the disabled occupant to, or providing for the disabled occupant, a room in which there is a lavatory, bath, shower or washhand basin or facilitating the use by the disabled occupant of such a facility;</li>
	<li>facilitating the preparation and cooking of food by the disabled occupant;</li>

	<p>(3) Subject to the preceding provisions of this Part, a local housing authority may approve an application for a disabled facilities grant where the relevant works do not fall within subsection (2) above but are for the purpose of making the dwelling suitable for the accommodation, welfare or employment of the disabled occupant.</p>
	<p>(4) In this section "the disabled occupant" means the disabled person for whose benefit it is proposed to carry out any of the relevant works.</p>
	<p>(5) In this Part "disabled person" means—

	<li>that, if the owner's interest which he has is an interest in a dwelling and this paragraph is not excluded by subsection (6) below, he gives a certificate of future occupation which falls within subsection (2) or subsection (4) of section 94 above.</li></ol></p>
	<p>(6) Paragraph (b) of subsection (5) above does not apply if—

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the Minister a few questions on something that we regard as highly controversial. The new clause, like Government's new clauses 12 to 14, refers to the group repair schemes. We have all been pleased that enveloping schemes have been used well by many local authorities, including mine. But practical problems have arisen in setting up the schemes and persuading owners and landlords to participate in them. Any reform to the schemes should make them more workable. The new clauses are therefore flawed and unsatisfactory. The Secretary of State is taking new powers, and that will lead to delay and non-implementation. Means tests are to be brought in, and that will be a major disincentive to participate.

We have dealt with enveloping schemes in relation to the new area renewal schemes that we have already debated.

Area renewal schemes are a vast improvement on enveloping schemes. I have described the difficulties that I experienced in my constituency with enveloping schemes even when I was a Minister at the Department of the Environment but not responsible for housing. The new schemes are a dramatic improvement. They will cover wider areas and incorporate far more homes, which the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) should welcome.

	<li>the building was constructed so as to comprise at least one house and is contiguous or adjacent to the primary building; and</li>
	<li>The exterior of the building is not in reasonable repair and is in need of works similar to those required to the exterior of the primary building; and</li>
	<li>carrying out the works to the building and the primary building at the same time is the most effective way of securing the repair of each of them.</li></ol></p></blockquote>

	<ol>
	<li>a terrace of houses shall be regarded as one building except that, if it appears appropriate to a local housing authority to do so, having regard in particular to the requirements of subsection (1) above, they may treat part only of the terrace as a building; and</li>
	<li>if, apart from this paragraph, one building would be regarded as containing two or more purpose-built flats and one or more houses, the part of the building containing the purpose-built flats and the part or parts of the building containing the houses shall be regarded as separate buildings.</li></ol></p></blockquote>

	<p>(2) For the purposes of subsection (1) above, "house" includes premises which were originally constructed as a house but which, by the time the group repair scheme is prepared, have been divided so as to form one or more flats, with or without other premises; and, in the case of a house which has been so divided, the cost of such of the external works as relate to the house shall be apportioned between the several parts into which the house has been divided in such way as may be agreed between the persons with owner's interests in those parts or, in default of agreement, equally.</p>
	<p>(3) In the case of a person who participates in a scheme as an unassisted participant, the rate of contribution shall be 100 per cent.</p>
	<p>(4) In the case of a person who participates in a scheme as an assisted participant but whose owner's interest in the part of the qualifying building in question is an interest in premises other than a house or flat, the rate of contribution, subject to subsection (5) below, shall be—

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Schedule 5 deals with changes to the Finance Act 1988 caused by the introduction of the poll tax—or community charge—and the penalties for those who fail to register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It ill befits a Government who are imposing a tax on people on lower incomes who will be penalised disproportionately to those who are better off, also to allow the law to apply disproportionately harshly to the worst off or the confused. There will be a recurring £200 fine on those who fail to register, instead of use being made of the normal court action available to any Government in such circumstances. Having failed to register, and been penalised by a £50 fine—a £200 fine for a second offence—an individual will find that the £200 fine will recur should he fail to register a third or a fourth time. It is difficult to see how action would not be taken to ensure that someone's registration was applied for. If he has not registered, he would be known not to have registered and his registration would, presumably, be automatic. Presumably the provision is being applied only to be vindictive towards those who are confused or towards the many who are unable to register because, for example, they live on boats or are itinerant. The already draconian poll tax would hit them again and again through the recurring £200 fine.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The community charge system will ensure a return to fairness because everyone will pay his bit.
