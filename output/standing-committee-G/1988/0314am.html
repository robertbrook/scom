	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 146, in page 121, line 6, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"(e) for the representation of any individual councillor who is not a member of a political group.".</p></q>
The schedule 1 deals with the balance on divided committees, and paragraph 3(1)(a) refers to
	<br><q><p>"the circumstances in which the members of a relevant authority are to be treated as divided into different political groups".</p></q>
Subsequent paragraphs refer to the composition of the various political groups on an authority in accordance with the political division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On several occasions, I have raised issues involving councillors who are not identified with a political party. At our third sitting on 28 February, I talked about those who campaigned in local authority elections as independents or representing ratepayers or some other group, professing themselves to be non-political, and in his reply the Minister told us about his experience of such people, many of whom, away from the cut and thrust of local government, were political activists and one of whom was even the chairman of the Tory party. We must consider how such individuals will be affected by the schedule, which deals with the political balance on local authority committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the opposite is sometimes true? Someone elected as an independent may turn out to be a life-long member of the Labour party and put forward Labour party policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I only reiterated what the Minister said. I am trying not to score political points but to explain what might happen. If the hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) wants to discuss the matter, I am prepared to do so, but that might be out of order, Mr. Hunt. That reflects the hon. Gentleman's lack of experience. If he takes the tablets and keeps coming foward, he will improve and we shall help him. We should confine ourselves to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>362</span>
discussing the political balance on local authority committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3(1)(b) states:
	<br><q><p>"as to the persons who are to be treated as members of such a group and as to when a person is to be treated as having ceased to be a member of such a group".</p></q>
Will those ad hoc political groups be governed by regulations and if so what form will they take? What will be the position of independent ratepayer councillors who are presumed to be non-political?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the first authority to which I was elected, the majority group was comprised of independent ratepayers who professed to be non-political. The problem still exists although it is not as prevalent as it used to be on urban or metropolitan district councils. However, a few individuals are elected as independent Labour councillors. They lean to the Socialist cause and may attract votes because they are independent of the Labour party. They usually campaign in traditional Labour wards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will there be regulations, a decree or measures in the Bill to accommodate people who campaign as independents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Irvine Patnick 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hallam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I question whether independent Labour councillors are members of the national Labour party. I wonder whether they are dissidents who have had their party card taken away from them and stand more for a nuisance factor. Could they not be sheep that return to the flock?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whatever disguise they come under, perhaps the hon. Gentleman will help the Committee and say where he thinks such people would fit in under paragraph 3(1) of schedule 1, which provides for persons who
	<br><q><p>"are to be treated as members of such a group"</p></q>
and treated as having ceased to be members of the group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On page eight of 	<i>The Independent</i> on 8 March, I saw an advertisement on behalf of the Liberal party, staged by Michael Meadowcroft, in which Philip Howson, a member of the alphabet party—the SDP, SLD or whatever it calls itself—appeared as a Liberal party representative on Sheffield council. He identified himself, and I think that it is the identification that the Government are concerned about. It is a question of identification, not of calling oneself an independent or whatever. I would class an independent who consistently voted with the Conservative party as a Conservative, and vice versa.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot comment on the make-up of the Liberal party in Leeds or Sheffield. The hon. Gentleman referred to the former Member of Parliament, Michael Meadowcroft. As far as we are concerned, he has gone, and gone for ever, from where he stood, but if he were elected to a local authority council that would be a matter for concern. How could the adjudicator, or whoever is put in charge of personnel—the whistle blower of a local authority, for instance—say to the Democrats that if
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0620">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>363</span>
he were elected a Liberal, he should be part of their group? It would be difficult. Unless there is clarification in the Bill such a decision could be subject to challenge. To say that if a person votes with the Tories or the Labour party, or has the title of Liberal when the title of the national party has gone, he will be put into a particular group could, I think, create problems for local authorities. We want some clarification because we foresee anomalies. I raised the issue during our third sitting and the Minister recognised my concern and responded to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. John Gummer)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman would like to give the Democrats in the Committee an opportunity during his speech, which I take seriously, to give us a quick tour d'horizon of the various divisions among the Liberals and Social Democrats. It would help all hon. Members in advising their constituents during county council elections. I find that people are extremely mystified about the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. I should like you to rule on the relevance of the past 30 seconds of debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. and learned Gentleman is absolutely right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister is correct in drawing attention to the matter, but I feel sure that when the Democrats have had their conference and got their act together, we shall know what their terms will be. I think that it will be a collective decision. Obviously, I appreciate the problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. Would you care to rule on the relevance of the past 30 minutes of debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not want to be as sweeping as that, but I hope that the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) will speak more specifically to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry for being side-tracked—not twin-tracked—Mr. Hunt. I am worried about the political balance on local authority committees and whether the terms of the schedule apply to councillors who stand as independents or ratepayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3(1)(c) refers to provisions:
	<br><q><p>"requiring the question whether a person is or is not a member of a political group to be determined in such manner as may be provided for by or under the regulations"</p></q>
How will the regulations identify that situation? Paragraph 3(1) refers to matters on which we need clarification. What will the regulations mean? How will they apply to those without a political ticket or tag when they are elected to, and sit on, a council?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have raised that issue in connection with parish councils and the politically restricted list. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>364</span>
Minister said that if someone had not campaigned on a political ticket and no political literature had been used—and if there was twin-tracking—he would not be included in the restricted list. I refer to a similar person in this context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If someone is not included in the politically restricted list, how can he be identified with a political group on a council? Can the Minister give an explanation, an outline or a brief about the meaning of paragraphs (a) to (d) in respect of those who are not political members of a council? How would these provisions apply to them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 146 would add paragraph (e) which states:
	<br><q><p>"for the representation of any individual councillor who is not a member of a political group."</p></q>
If the Minister cannot clarify the issue now or give an outline of the regulations, I ask the Committee to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Truro)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not comment at length on the amendment but merely add my support to it. I draw the Committee's attention to amendment No. 151 to clause 13, which had a similar intent although a more specific approach. Unfortunately, because of our turbo-charged rate of progress in the previous sitting, that amendment was not selected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that the Bill contains no provision for individual independent councillors. I recall our debates on party representation when there seemed to be an assumption that independents are in themselves a political group. In my part of the world some independents on a council will constitute a group by working together and arguing that they are part of the independent group on the council. Others are not identified even as independents and stand on their own, as farmers or whatever. Their inclination toward one party or another rarely has a political alignment. Some work one way and others another way. Some are regarded by their fellow councillors as genuinely independent while others are not. What comprises the independents can be very complex.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some councils in Cornwall and in other rural areas have many independents, although the independent role is fading in other councils. At present there is no provision in the Bill to protect their position when it comes to committee work. I cannot believe that that is the Minister's intention, but it seems that an individual councillor, who works genuinely as an independent and regards himself as non-aligned will have no right to committee representation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does the hon. Gentleman define an independent in that instance? Let us take a specific example. I understand that the people on the Isle of Wight who were to stand as Democrats have special permission from the right hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) to call themselves Liberals. If one of them decides to call himself a Democrat and so after the election is not part of the Liberal group—as that would be different from the Democrat group—would that person then be classified as an independent, or would he have to stand as an independent in the first place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0621">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>365</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to incur your wrath, Mr. Hunt, by straying from the amendment. Earlier in our discussions, I argued that it would be easy for confusion to arise about who is and who is not a member of a group. That confusion could be caused deliberately or, for example, by people standing under different labels, but on the same manifesto. I gave the specific example of where the Labour party is overwhelmingly dominant on a council and divides itself to get political assistance. The Minister seemed convinced that he could tell the difference between individual members so, presumably, in the example that he has just given, he will find that equally easy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not discussing, however, those who have a clear political identity. The Minister may give as many amusing examples as he likes, but in this instance I am interested when people do not stand under a political label of any description and are recognised as acting in an independent way on the council. Those people have no consistent voting pattern with a political group, vote on issues as they see them and are supported by their local electorate as independents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many such councillors in my part of the world and elsewhere in rural England and Wales and Scotland. The Bill does not protect the right of those individuals to sit on a committee. They are effectively written off the agenda because the Minister does not seem to believe that anyone can have that degree of independence. I should be delighted to give way to the Minister if he were to tell us that he will ensure that those individuals will be protected and be able to site on most committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, my intervention is primarily to give him the courteous opportunity of sitting down for a second. He suggested that he wanted to deal only with those who have no clear political identity. In my example on the Isle of Wight there appeared to be no clear political identity. It would be wrong to move away from the amendment, but we have an opportunity for clarification here. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment will have difficulty answering the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Under-Secretary believes that there is a difficulty perhaps he should accept amendments on Report or introduce his own proposals to make it clear what happens when party gorups run under different descriptions. If the Minister for Local Government believes that the question is easy to determine, I shall take his word for it. If he has a different view now, perhaps he will explain it to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is serious, many councillors in my part of the world will wonder why no specific provision appears in the Bill. Surely the wording of this or previous amendments would cover the omission most appropriately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the beginning of our proceedings I referred to a long-serving independent councillor in north Cornwall with a well established reputation. He will find it hard to understand why Ministers wish to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>366</span>
protect the role and interest of those working within a party political grouping. Generally speaking, those people can muster support and speak up for themselves. They may not always succeed but they are better able to do so than most independents. They can fall back on national organisations, which will take up their causes. An independent councillor has no one on whom to fall back. Under the regulations, he will be excluded from serving on committees. There will be no eye to ensure that there is a balance of membership, with a voice for all parties. Independent councillors will be justifiably concerned if the provisions are not amended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the Under-Secretary of State has an encyclopaedic desire to meet all the points that are raised in the debate. That being so, he may seek to stray outwith your carefully drawn parameters of order, Mr. Hunt, and deal with the Isle of Wight. I hope that he will consider also Fife regional council and Dr. Peter Davison. Although Dr. Davison no longer takes the Conservative whip he stood as a Conservative candidate at the previous regional council elections. Rather uncharacteristically for a former Conservative, Dr. Davison has now struck out independently. Will the Minister explain how the rights of such councillors will be properly protected if the amendment is not accepted?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
North-East Fife district council has two independent councillors who have been in local government for a long time. One has been elected as chairman of the planning committee, although he does not belong to the ruling Social and Liberal Democratic group. The other is a persuasive and articulate exponent of community politics. They both make a substantial contribution to the good of local government in north-east Fife. I do not always agree with them, but they are active and make an effective contribution to local politics in north-east Fife. Under the Bill their position would not be protected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. David Trippier)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman tell the Committee precisely what the position is now? Are those independent councillors given places on council committees?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed they are, as I explained. No doubt the Minister's mind was turning rapidly to how to respond to earlier comments. As I said only a moment ago, one councillor is chairman of the planning committee. He holds that post by the grace, favour and good sense of the majority group—the Social and Liberal Democrats. Its members choose to give him that post because they know the contribution that he can make. If the ruling group had a less reasonable turn of mind his talents might be lost. That is because the Bill makes no provision for the proper representation of independents on council committees. As other hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) have said, independents have a substantial amount to contribute to local government. The Bill should ensure that they are not discriminated against by those who have the political advantage of the majority on any council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>367</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert B. Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hertfordshire, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was an independent councillor in the hon. and learned Gentleman's constituency and served as such on the former Fife county council. All 40 independents on the county council belonged to the independent group that jointly selected its conveners and candidates for the county convenership. They were called independent only because they did not stand under a political label. We were in that position because the Conservative party thought that we were too independent to stand as Conservatives, and not out of choice. Nevertheless, we banded together to form a group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is most interesting, and no doubt you find it illuminating, Mr. Hunt. It will make the remainder of your tenure as the Chairman much easier. However, the hon. Gentleman's point does not deal with the Opposition's argument that there should be a means by which the contribution made by independent councillors is formalised. At present they rest upon the good will of the majority group of the councils, which is insufficient protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In rural areas, especially in the north of Scotland, and in the Borders, independent councillors are traditionally important. There is at least one district council in Scotland where independents are the ruling group, which means that the majority are independents and that the principal activities of the local council are carried on from the ranks of the independents. That demonstrates the worth of independents to local government. The amendment seeks to institutionalise that worth, and the Minister should accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the spirit in which the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) moved the amendment. It was a replication of his contribution on the Floor of the House in the early hours of this morning when we had a useful and interesting debate on the anti-social behaviour of tenants. Because of the lateness of the hour we were shedding more light than heat on that subject. Today the hon. Gentleman has asked some fair questions, which must be answered. However, the amendment is unnecessary, because the power that it seeks to provide is already provided by paragraph 3(2) of the schedule, which enables the Secretary of State to make regulations to modify clauses 13 and 14 where some members are constituted as political groups, and others are not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall continue the consultation process, especially with local authority associations, to get the legislation right. The hon. Member for Normanton said that unless matters are made clear they could be subject to challenge. The White Paper defines a political group as
	<br><q><p>"any group of councillors who wish to associate themselves for the purpose of allocating committee places".</p></q>
The emphasis is on "associate", and we do not envisage that ana individual councillor should be able to form a political group on his or her own. I was surprised, as I am certain the hon. Member for Normanton was, that such a significant contribution was made by the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor)

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Come off it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East does not like it, but it is a golden opportunity. Surely political parties and independence are relevant to this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Truro was slowly walking into the jaws of death in defining independence. His party, and those allied to it, have a propensity for creating new parties, for repackaging old ones, for merging or demerging with others and for falling out rapidly. He tried to explain the different ways in which independents work and implied that some would not know how to work at all. That reminds me of the current state of his own party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The knub of the issue is how the council makes appointments to unallocated seats. That point was made well by the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East. We are certainly prepared to listen to the views of hon. Members in and outside Committee and to consider in greater detail with the local authority associations how to tackle the problem. My personal view is that it should be dealt with in regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that assurance, I hope that the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned about those who are not part of any group. It is all very well to talk about grouping to ensure representation, but the individual who is non-aligned has no guarantee of any committee representation on the council. The Minister said that perhaps that would come under regulations, but it is difficult to see how that will happen under the provision in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman puts it well. That problem must be tackled, although it will be difficult to find a solution. However, it is not necessarily impossible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt already with the precise problem of an individual independent member being classed as a political group. We should fight shy of doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Truro is right to say that this is a difficult issue, but we are concerned wherever possible with the protection of minority groups. I have made it clear that we do not class an individual as a political group, but if individuals who are non-aligned—the hon. Gentleman's precise point—join together and are classified as a political group, they should have protection. In other words, I accept the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is not accepting the thrust of my argument. He seems to be saying that the only right that he would give to representation on a committee is where independents group themselves and ask for representation on that basis. The Minister

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>369</span>
is not allowing independents to continue to work genuinely independently without forming themselves into a group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, what view would the Minister take where there is only one independent on the council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is precisely the one independent councillor that I meant. The honourable and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) said that the independents on his local authority were given places on committees through the grace and favour of that authority. We all know of councils that operate in that way. I understand that the Opposition want protection for those individuals. In a large council with 60 members in political groups and one independent, it depends on the local authority and its voting procedures whether that individual has any representation on committees. The individual is involved in regular council meetings, but has difficulty with committees. A number of independent councillors may form a political group, even though they are non-aligned with a major political party, or individuals may be completely non-aligned. We have considered what protection should be built into the Bill and have consulted the local authority associations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I might be slightly at odds with my hon. Friends because I agree with the Minister. Until 1983, Durham city council was controlled by a large majority of independents who formed a group to align with the Tories and the alliance to outvote the majority Labour party. It was an advantage for them to form a political group and their leader became leader of the council. They were anti-Labour, not independent. They made it clear that they would support anyone who did not support the Labour party and eventually they led the council. They have now lost control to Labour, but they are still regarded as a group and they get a proportion of the seats allocated to the Opposition. There is no such thing as an independent. An independent is usually anti the party in power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a generalisation. I am concerned that the hon. Gentleman has aligned himself with my cause. That may ditch my chances of persuading the hon. Member for Normanton not to press the amendment.

	<br><q><p>"such incidental provision and such supplemental, consequential and transitional provision"</p></q>
as he considers appropriate. I am in favour of amendment No. 126, because the powers are too widely drawn. However, I shall concentrate my remarks on amendment No. 127 because it deals with a specific problem that I hope the Minister will resolve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause seems to allow the Minister to treat a specific authority differently from authorities as a whole. He could make rules which apply to Brent in one form and to Cornwall in a completely different form. I hope that the Minister will reassure the Committee that that is not his intention. The clause specifies "any relevant authority", so the Minister could single out any authority. If that is the power given to the Minister by the Bill, I hope that he accepts that he should not have it and that it should not be in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain his intentions? If he feels that the amendment is not the best way to approach the problem, will he present the Committee later with proposals to clarify the meaning of the clause? It would be wrong to give he Minister powers to single out authorities on particular grounds. His powers would be too wide and that is something that the Committee should resist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I can set the mind of the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) at rest on his specific point. It is not the Government's intention to make special regulations for one or two authorities and different regulations for others. I am not sure why the hon. Gentleman feels that it is, but I shall consider the matter again to see whether there is a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to have the more general powers for two reasons. First, we want a core and reasonable series of standing orders because in some authorities the position is serious. It is sensible for the protection of everyone to have standing orders with which all agree. That will not be done until discussions with local authorities have been completed. A model set of standing orders will be established and, in normal circumstances, we should expect local authorities to find them helpful and to follow them. Some of them will form the core group which all local authorities will have to take on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0624">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>371</span>
Secondly, the powers will give us the opportunity to make alterations in areas with which, I think, the hon. Member for Truro would agree. Some local authorities have arrangements to constantly and continuously call meetings for a small number of councillors. They are supposed to be emergency meetings. In those circumstances it is reasonable to have some protection for the other councillors not involved. That would not remove the possibility of calling extraordinary meetings when proper, but if it would stop meetings being called continuously. That is important because we are trying to encourage people to become councillors. If the council holds an overwhelming number of meetings, it bears down on individuals and it becomes impossible for a reasonable member of society to be a councillor unless he takes it as a full-time job. People will be protected against that type of misuse, and that is an example of the subordinate legislation which needs to be covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Discussion will take place with local authorities, and I think that the hon. Member for Truro will be pleased with the results. The first meetings have been held and it is hoped a report will be produced by the end of July. Thereafter, the regulations will be made. I assure the hon. Gentleman that they will not be unsatisfactory from his point of view. However, I have asked for legal advice because I do not wish to mislead him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relevant authority is defined in clause 16(2) to show what authorities will be covered by the clause. Clause 140 provides a general power to make different regulations for different cases or different descriptions of authorities, but not for individual authorities. If there were a special arrangement for education committees, it would not be satisfactory to make such a standing order for authorities that were not education committees. Authorities must be put into different classes. There will be descriptions of authorities, such as the City of London and the council of the Isles of Scilly, which will be in categories of their own for which special provision is needed because of their special powers. They are the only cases in which individual authorities will be designated and will always be treated as being in a class of their own because they operate on a different basis. The Isles of Scilly have a special single-tier system, which is outwith the normal run in the United Kingdom. There should be more authorities outwith the normal run because more variety would be better, but that is not the position at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his helpful comments. There is no point in arguing generally about centralising powers and the ability of Ministers to intervene. Perhaps the Minister would write to clarify the issue a little further because I should like to know the legal interpretation. In that spirit, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 128, in page 23, line 11, leave out
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>372</span>
	<br><q><p>"or any parish or community council".</p></q>
The intention behind the amendment is to ensure that standing orders laid down by the Secretary of State should apply only to principal councils. I do not think that I need to elaborate. In a previous sitting, I suggested that the rules governing the balance of committees should apply also to parish and community councils. The Minister argued strongly that it was not necessary to embrace them in the Bill. I wish to argue equally strongly that in that case it would be inappropriate to include such councils. However, if the Minister does not intend to transfer what I regard as the better provisions in the Bill to parish and community councils, he should not extend what I regard as the worst provisions to them. Equal treatment on all provisions would have some merit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find the grading of the provisions odd. Most people would agree that the need for generally acceptable standing orders for the continuation of business is central to democratic arrangements. I sit on the General Synod of the Church of England, which has some standing orders that are preposterous in terms of democratic decisions. For example, it is possible to move an amendment so late that it cannot itself be amended and is passed unamended. I know of no other body where that could happen. That has always appeared odd to me in an authority that claims to base its standing orders on those of the House of Commons. I do my best to make it change some of its arrangements. I use the example because I know how seriously disrupting to sensible discussion a failure of standing orders can be. Standing orders are important, while we do not intend to apply them to parishes at this moment, some large parishes have a considerable budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand the determination of the Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) to apply the committee structure to authorities which generally do not have committees. Most parish councils have only the council, therefore the committee mechanism is unsuitable and most will welcome the model rules we do not intend to apply the statutory parts to parish councils. However, there are circumstances—for example if there were complaints—in which it would be sensible to extend to large parish coucils the core of standing orders which apply to local government to defind the rights of minorities and ensure that democracy is seen to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the procedure depends upon producing proper standing orders in consultation with local government representatives, it is no bad thing to have that power in the Bill if something goes wrong. It could not be misused, but it could be useful. I hope that the hon. Member for Truro will withdraw the amendment on the assurance that the power will not be used unless it would be sensible to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's reply is deeply unsatisfactory. He argues that there is no need for a provision for party balance because virtually no parish council has committees. But the Minister wants parish and community councils to be included

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has missed the point. Virtually all parish councils have standing orders—I do not know of any that do not have them—and, therefore the provision might apply in future. As virtually no parish councils have committees, arrangements about committees will not apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is now using a different argument. He said that in larger councils it was important that standing orders were laid down because of their wider powers. That is different from what he has just said. His answer is deeply unsatisfactory. While he is extending the Government's powers to intervene, he is happy for them to be extended to parish or community councils. When he is protecting the role of minorities, he takes a different view. That is unhelpful. If I ask leave to withdraw the amendment, it will be because we may return to the subject later and not because I accept what the Minister has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gary Waller 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Keighley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 17(1)(d) refers to the Common Council of the City of London. I agree with what my right honourable Friend the Minister for Local Government has said about the virtues of the City of London Corporation but I am curious about why the subsection refers only to the Common Council of the City of London. It is not always understood that members of the Court of Aldermen of the City have the same rights in relation to planning and other local government matters as members of the Court of Common Council. In this context, the Court of Common Council may be intended to incorporate members of the Court of Aldermen who sit with it on occasions. Staff are employed by the City of London Corporation and it is not clear why the subsection refers to the Common Council rather than to the City corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By convention, members of the City of London Corporation, whether members of the Court of Common Council or the Court of Aldermen, are not elected as members of party groups. Neither do they
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>374</span>
sit on the basis of party affiliation, but there is no technical reason why they should not. It is conceivable that in future individuals, might break that convention and stand as councillors on the basis of their party membership. Although some of the provisions of part I do not apply now, they could in future apply to the Court of Aldermen and to the Court of Common Council. The malpractices that part I is designed to eliminate could apply to the Court of Aldermen as much as to the Court of Common Council. Questions have been asked about the election of aldermen in the past, bearing in mind that they are local government representatives and have local government as well as ceremonial functions.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause would change the provisions of the Local Government Finance Act 1982, of the Local Government Act 1985 and of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 relating to the public inspection, at the time of audit, of the accounts of local authorities and certain other bodies in England and Wales, and in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment will mean that purely personal information about employees will not be available for inspection by any persons interested in inspecting the accounts to be audited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the new clause we are fulfilling the undertaking that we gave in April 1988 to amend the law relating to the public inspection of local authority accounting records at the time of audit. We gave that undertaking, after consulting the local authority associations and other interested parties, essentially to restore the legal position to that which everyone had thought it was before a High Court ruling in April 1986.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the process of local authority audit involves an authority's accounting records being open to inspection by any person interested, and it is an important element in the overall accountability mechanisms. I need not remind the Committee that the Government attach great importance to the accountability of local authorities, that being part of our purpose in introducing the Bill. This right of inspection enables the public to see how the council has been running its financial affairs, and can provide the means for an elector to obtain the information that he might need for him to exercise his statutory rights of objecting to the auditor about a matter relating to the accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it would be quite wrong if the right of public inspection enabled a person to discover something about the personal affairs of an authority's employee—for example, that the employee was paying maintenance for children of a previous marriage, or other sensitive information such as contributing to a charity of his choice, or paying dues to his union. It was long thought that the statutory right of inspection would not allow a member of the public to gain access to such information, and clearly, such information had no bearing on how the authority was managing its affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty was that, in April 1986, the High Court held in a case involving Northampton borough
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>376</span>
council that the accounting records—in fact, the payroll records—containing such personal information were open to public inspection. That caused great concern. We recognised and accepted that concern, and hence proposed amending the statutory provisions so that once again the law stood as everyone had in the past believed it to be. That is what we are doing today in the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purely personal information about employees that the new clause seeks to protect from inspection is information relating specifically to an individual. It is information that appears in the accounts and documents because of the ways in which local authorities and public bodies keep their records—in particular, today, their computerised payrolls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The information to be protected includes, as I have already indicated, such things as income tax, national insurance contributions, attachment of earnings orders, contributions to charities, and maintenance payments—in practice, the range of deductions from the gross pay, overtime and allowances made to employees and former employees. The provision does not take effect until 1 April 1990 to enable local authorities to make minor adjustments to their computing systems to protect personal information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the new clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We would welcome the clarification and restoration of the law as perceived before the High Court ruling of April 1986, if it did not link itself inexorably with clauses 1 and 2 of the Bill. If the new clause were free standing, and if we were simply reverting to the situation that we believed it to be, there would be no difficulty. The problem is that subsection (3) of the new clause relates the availability of information about the gross pay of local authority staff to the snooper's charter that the Government have created in the Bill, whereby people will be able to obtain information about an individual's gross salary or wage and relate it to information about their political activities. Inevitably, a person earning over £13,500 a year will be subject to the infringement of their civil rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it was known that an individual was canvassing on behalf of a political party, putting a poster in a window, writing an article for a newspaper, speaking on radio, or acting as the chairman, secretary or treasurer of a local political party or its association, someone could go into the local town or county hall and find out that individual's gross salary. If the individual was found to be earning more than £13,500 a year, the question asked would be whether he was breaching his contract of employment and whether action should be taken against him. That is a gross infringement of civil rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would have been a very different matter if the new clause had said that certain categories of earnings would be available to individuals seeking them—for example, the scales applicable within a local authority. The present wording puts individuals in jeopardy of having their personal circumstances investigated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the consultation paper was issued, the Government said that an audit procedure, which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0627">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>377</span>
made such information available, would be open to abuse. That is true. It is as true of the individual gross salary of a man or woman employed by a local authority as it is of the information that the Minister spelt out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Companies Acts, people are entitled to know the general scales and applicability of salaries—not of individuals, but of categories and levels of individuals in firms. We shall be happy if the provision is intended to apply as it applies to private concerns under the Companies Acts, and we shall be interested to know how the individual rights of citizens can be protected when the snooper or the interferer, or the neighbour with a grudge, seeks to pry into the salaries of those who are carrying out a legitimate political activity which may or may not infringe the unacceptable legislation that we have already passed in this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always feel slightly bemused when Ministers say that they set great store by the principle of accountability of local government. Why do they not also say that they set great store by the accountability of Ministers at the Scottish Office—who, of course, are completely unaccountable to the people of Scotland? That does not seem to worry them in the least, although they are worried about the accountability of councillors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right for the public to know is essential; otherwise there could be great abuse. There was the recent case of Westminster city council, which the chief executive was paid £1 million for his silence about the sale of graveyards. Had it been possible to conceal that information, it would have been a conspiracy against the public interest. The public must know about such things, if we are to prevent the abuse of which the Tory administration of Westminster city council was guilty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important also that the public have access to general information about the wages and salaries of council officials. Otherwise, chief officers, instead of being officers of the whole council, as the Minister constantly says they should be, might accept huge wage increases from the administration in return for their partisanship, and the public might know nothing about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So it is important that information about wages and salaries should be made available to the public, but not in the way that new clause 1 suggests. We object to making available to the public specific information about specific individuals, not general information about the wages and salaries that can be paid to officers in a council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the problem, but I stress that the new clause seeks to put the law back to what it was always understood to be. The information has always been available to the public; the question arose whether the information could be provided on its own, without details of deduction, and so on. The court case showed that what had always been deemed unnecessary could not be excluded. Does the hon. Gentleman propose that we should not put the law back to what it was thought to be but change it

	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is getting to the core of our argument. The clause will involve risks because of the way in which the information will be provided to the public. It will be about identifiable individuals and could be abused by all sorts of groups. The common example is insurance agents who pick out the high earners and continually plague them to take out insurance policies. Mail order firms, double glazing companies and others could get information about high earners in a council and make those people's lives a misery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister failed to hear my point. I forgive him but, had he listened, he would have heard me say that, as a new contractual obligation will be placed on local authority officers to the effect that they should not engage in political activity if they earn more than £13,500 a year, their gross salary will become highly relevant to their contracts of employment and the way in which people will snoop on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point, but we have other objections. That information will be open to political as well as commercial abuse. A phenomenon which is better known in Dundee than in other parts of the country is the scurrilous broadsheet that is put out at election times with no name and for which no one claims responsibility. Such broadsheets concentrate on how much money certain councillors claim in expenses. In future, there could also be scurrilous broadsheets that identify council employees. By attacking them, people could attack the administration that is standing for reelection. An innocent individual could be the object of a scurrilous broadsheet published at election time even though he was not standing for election. Detailed information about his salary could be put through thousands of doors in Dundee. That is a serious problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am seriously concerned about this. It was unhappy of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) to say that I had not listened. I listened carefully, but the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) put a different point with which I have great sympathy. If such personal detail could be excluded, I would propose that the clause should go further. The Northampton case concerned this problem. It showed that, because information was available, a fraud could be discovered by a ratepayer. There would be difficulties if such information were excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not expect to convince the Member for Dundee, East on that point. Is he proposing that, even if we were not dealing with a party political matter which divides us on the £13,500 limit, this information should not be available for other reasons? I want to follow the hon. Gentleman's argument carefully because I am not totally convinced about this matter. I am trying to feel my way to get the best answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The objection to new clause 1 is that the information available to the public will be identified with an individual working for the council and could be used commercially or politically to attack councillors through council officials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only a question of scurrilous broadsheets. Often, the local press is antagonistic to an administration and attacks it by publishing information on how much the council pays its employees. That may be legitimate in a democracy, but as soon as employees are identified and their pictures and their salaries appear in the local paper, it becomes a matter of political controversy. Council employees should be protected from such behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Information on council employee's salaries could be made available as it is made available under the Companies Acts. It should not be easily and readily identified with individual council employees. That is a major flaw and the Government should deal with the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not follow the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), who reopened the debate on earlier clauses, except to say that that shows that this important aspect of the Bill has been misunderstood, despite our many hours of concentration and debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The £13,500 mark does not automatically restrict political activity. Some people will earn more than that, but they will have taken their case to the adjudicating officer and will not be thought likely to be involved in political activity. The hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) said that the supervisor of his local crematorium might be able to become involved in local government. Some employees who earn less than £13,500, however, who are thought to be in sensitive posts, will be restricted from becoming involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That information has been available to local authority electors and to anyone who is interested for sometime. The Government feel strongly about the importance of the accountability of local authorities and the importance of scrutiny. My right hon. Friend the Minister said that, in the Northampton case, a serious situation was revealed by scrutiny of the accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are aware of the need for personal privacy and the tension between that and the need for proper accountability. I assure the Committee that we shall examine the matter to see whether other aspects should be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must make it clear to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) that the new clause does not restrict public access to information about employees' gross pay, allowances and bonuses. The new clause makes it clear that the information that is opened to inspection includes payment for benefits provided to an employee in respect of his ceasing to hold office. That will enable those who are interested to find out the leaving allowances of the late chief executive of Derbyshire county council, on which many have speculated. Unlike the Westminster case, that information is not yet available. I commend the new clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to open a debate that is going on behind the scenes but which we have had no opportunity to discuss—the remuneration of councillors for undertaking agreed and approved duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, an attendance allowance of £18.25 is available for a 24-hour period. Alternatively, loss of earnings, which must be proved, up to £29.70 can be claimed for a 24-hour period. Last week, we debated councillors' time off. We debated those who are employed by one authority and serve on another, and those who are employed by private companies and others, and released from work. If reasonable remuneration were available to compensate for the loss incurred by representing the local community, there would be no problem, but, rumour and innuendo have it that £2,000 may be the annual payment for councillors, whatever their duties and whatever the size or functions of the authority. That would be wrong, and it would undermine accountable, representative democracy. It would place the emphasis on market democracy as opposed to open political democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong for only the rich or the retired to be able to take part in local government. People who are working and responsible for sustaining themselves and their families would either be faced with enormous losses as a result of trying to carry out their duties, or they would have to come off local authorities. That is happening with all political parties because of the prospects for elected members. Changes in the law, the prospect of the Bill, difficulties carrying out duties, and the abuse heaped on elected members' heads by the Government and the media—which the Government encourage—lead people to believe that it is not worth serving in local government. Those people may undertake charitable duties and take part in pressure groups in their spare time, but the important and historically successful role of serving the local community is being undermined. What do Ministers regard as the criteria to be laid down in discussions that commenced yesterday and which were deferred because of the debate with the local authority associations?

Elected members should not be ashamed of receiving proper remuneration. The scurrilous campaign mounted by Conservative Members in the Local Government Act 1972 should never have taken place. It was disgraceful that people are villified for claiming that legitimate entitlement. Most local council members lose money and pension rights and these in jobs lose promotion prospects. Most local council members disable their relationships and family relationships by giving up an inordinate amount of their spare time rather than employment time. In those circumstances, there should be cross-party support for a system that recognises different levels of responsibility, different sizes of authority and the different functions undertaken by councillors, so that we reflect the reality revealed by the research undertaken for the Widdicombe part II committee. I say "part II" so that the Committee is not confused, as it was last week, when I was referring to Widdicombe I and everyone else was referring to Widdicombe II.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The research indicates that, in small district councils or London boroughs, an allowance of £2,000 a year would be adequate. For major cities, metropolitan districts and county areas, however, it would not be adequate, bearing in mind the range of responsibilities, the size of authorities—hundreds of millions of pounds are at stake for the efficient working of the authority—and the way we want the job to be done. The work involves meeting Ministers and taking part on other bodies such as urban development corporations and quangos, in which local government has a legitimate role to play. We should compare the remuneration of an accountable, elected official to that of an official appointed by the Government to undertake similar work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends will give more examples, but I shall give three figures. The maximum available to the chairman, not the chief executive or managing director, of a water authority in, for example, Yorkshire or Humberside is £51,000. We should compare that with the average received for attendance and loss of earnings in a metropolitan district—£2,800. That is the figure for last year as calculated by the Association of Metropolitan Authorities. In addition, the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick) receives almost £7,000 for the one day a fortnight he does in his onerous role as deputy chairman of the South Yorkshire residuary body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the hon. Gentleman's information, I receive more than that, and there are councillors on the residuary body, such as Sir Jack Laydon and the leader of Doncaster council, and they are paid. On most residuary bodies, a councillor represents the joint board and he is paid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully accept that, and I think that members of the residuary bodies would want representatives of local authorities to be properly remunerated. I should not dream of taking away that money from them—that is not my point. The hon.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>382</span>
Member for Sheffield, Hallam has supported a Government decision that will not give accountable local authority representatives anything like the money that I have described or the mere £58,000 that Tag Taylor, the former chairman of the AMA and of Sutton council draws.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The chairman of the London residuary body was previously employed as the chairman of a water authority. That means he took a cut in salary to do the job. [Hon. Members: "That does not matter."] With respect, he said that he received £5,000 as chairman of a water authority. As chairman of the London residuary body, he receives nowhere near that much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of clarification. The water authority of which he was chairman did not, and does not, pay that amount of money, although there may be bonuses and other remuneration that take the sum above £58,000. The chairman of a water authority does only a two and a half to three day week. I hope that the chairman of the residuary body does slightly more than that, even though he employs a chief executive to do the day-to-day administration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam does not know anything about the salary paid to the chairman of the London residuary body. If I remember rightly, he is being paid £57,500 a year to wind up the Greater London council whereas my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) drew the magnificent sum of £7,000 when he was leader of the council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct and reinforces my point. Ministers often appoint people who they sympathise with, and the approach that Ministers take towards them is different from that which they take towards the elected representatives of local councils. People should be properly remunerated, whether they are working on quangos or on bodies that have replaced local authority functions, or are running properly elected local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures that are agreed eventually for an adjustment to, or a replacement of, the existing system should reflect properly the need to ensure that, whatever their income or status, everyone can take part in local government activities without making money, but without incurring disabling loss. That is not an unreasonable proposition. People must be able to do their job properly and adequately. Leaders of councils and chairmen and chairwomen of large committees—such as education, social services and housing committees—must spend time in ensuring that the work of officers is properly monitored, that their decisions are accountable to the public, that committees do not incur enormous cost for the time that officers spend outside normal working hours and that they are able to meet people in the community, Ministers and pressure groups. Councillors must be able to do the type of job that we as Members of Parliament expect to do on behalf

of those whom we represent. That should not be unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Widdicombe committee recommended a basic level of £2,500, which was based on average male earnings, and those are much greater now than when the research took place. It recommended also that special responsibility allowances should be enhanced and become mandatory. As I said last week, authorities such as Sheffield declined to take them because of their diversionary nature and the way that they made it difficult for people to take or leave a post without considering the implications for themselves, their jobs and their families.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be unfair if the hon. Gentleman did not explain how the cash was used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Initially, the money made available was offset by employing a research assistant. Therefore, it did not fall on anyone else's payments. That assistant is not employed now, but can be under the Bill without any difficulty. Authorities such as Sheffield will be able to draw special responsibility allowances for their councillors and employ political advisers for the controlling and opposition groups. We endeavoured to be more than scrupulous in dealing with that, often to the detriment of the individuals involved, as I explained last week when one or two Conservative Members were absent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Ministers will clarify their intentions. The position of leading members of authorities should reflect the way in which Ministers allocate salaries to people who do not have the onerous pressures, diverse functions and difficulties that local government officers have. Whatever the size or functions of the authority, that reflection must be taken into account Otherwise, local authorities cannot be prevented from operating in the way that they have. The ability to undertake duties will change for the wealthy, the retired, housewives and the unemployed, but not for those in work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of us believe that there should be a properly agreed, just remuneration as salary or a direct reimbursement for employers. The system of paying the allowance directly to the employer who releases the employee on an agreed basis according to the duties is fair and reasonable. That system was adopted by Sheffield council when I was its leader. In that way, no one would lose out, other than in those cases that I outlined last week, in terms of pension and promotion, so people would be willing to make sacrifices to undertake public duties. They should not be expected to crucify their families to undertake the respectable, legitimate activities without which many members of the Committee would not be here today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should not ignore the genuine discussion about this issue, which is better dealt with without the sharpness of party political division. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) was incorrect to say that the first meeting of the committee took place yesterday and that it had been put off. The first meeting took place on 27 February
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>384</span>
and the second one will occur as soon as local government has produced the necessary information. The first dealt with standing orders, not the remuneration or expenses of councillors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people feel that local authorities are less effective than they could be and have greater difficulty than they ought in attracting candidates from all political parties because they hold too many meetings, spend too much time doing the jobs that officers should do, act as managers not directors, and are constantly involved in the day-to-day running of the council, which should be left to the professionals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday I had an interesting meeting with members of Leeds local authority. They showed me the difference in the numbers of hours, meetings, rooms and offices now used by elected members compared to the days when, for example, Lord Marshall or Lord Bellwin were council leaders in Leeds. There is a real distinction between the views of the two sides of the Committee as to how local authorities are best run.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to Leeds. Were those meetings, arranged by elected members for their constituents or citizens in Leeds to decide whether to hold events in the civic hall, approved duties?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am referring to committees, sub-committees working parties and other groups.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They take place in the evenings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not talking about the evenings. I am saying that the number of committee meetings set up by Leeds council has increased greatly because of a difference of approach to the way in which a local council is run. I am trying to say this in the most moderate way possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government believe that the best councils are those run by councillors acting as directors who set policies and control the way in which councils act, but which are managed by professionals. As I travel round the country, many professionals tell me, "I moved from that authority because I could no longer have the chairman of a committee sitting on my desk all the time. I could never get anything done."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To use the Minister's analogy even non-executive directors get a reasonable rate of remuneration to justify the quality of their input and the time that they devote to their companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman is perfectly right, but people become company directors to earn their living.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cecil Franks 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barrow and Furness)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not quarrel with much of what my right hon. Friend says, especially about the fact that numerous meetings and other difficulties do not attract the right calibre of person. Will my right hon. Friend tackle a fundamental question which worries all those who care about local government, irrespective of party—the generally poor calibre of local government representatives? Why is that so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the first matter that I am tackling in my discussions. Since 1974, there has been a great proliferation in the number of occasions on which councillors are expected to attend committee meetings, working parties, subcommittees and the like, to say nothing of the chance for ward members to see them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The opportunities—indeed, the necessities—offered by many local authorities are such that local representatives find that the amount of time involved is much greater than it once was. [Hon. Members: "Of course it is!"] The reason is not that the business has increased but that the powers have remained largely the same since 1974. Many authorities now believe that their elected representatives should be involved in management matters that previously were thought quite properly to be the business of professional local government officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about how local government officers have to operate in some authorities. I do not wish to be invidious, but I shall take the example of a senior local government officer in a Democrat-run authority who previously held a senior post with a Labour-run authority. I say non-partisanly that he finds that, in his present authority, he can at least get on with his job, whereas with his previous authority he found it impossible to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to what has happened since 1974. When I was a member of a local authority before 1974, 15 councillors, a town clerk, an engineer, a housing manager and a public health officer served a community of 18,000. After reorganisation, three councillors represented the area, and they had no officers. The extra call on councillors' time was genuine. An area that used to have 25 people looking after its interests was served by only three after the Local Government Act 1972. There was a substantial change in representation. Does the Minister accept the workload of those three councillors created demands on their time?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I used to be a local councillor. After reorganisation, I had to travel 14 miles to attend meetings. That involved a full day and we had as many meetings as possible in one day to conclude our business. Does the Minister recognise the tremendous changes that have taken place in local government since the 1972 reorganisation? Moreover, because of the amount of local government legislation since 1979, the workload has increased considerably. The Minister should accept that as the picture of local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>386</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that I was comparing 1974 with the period since then. The hon. Gentleman is right—there was a change. Before that time, the kind of authorities that existed and their scope was different. I specifically referred to the changes since 1974. I do not say this in any rancorous mood—there is simply a difference between us—but it seems that authorities that are dominated by the Labour party believe that the councillor's role is different from what it has been traditionally or from what the Government would like it to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Squire 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hornchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is on the right lines and I agree with the thrust of his remarks. Surely many of the changes made by local government legislation have related to officers rather than members. We should reasonably deduce that to be so on analysis of their respective roles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can draw on my experience as a former leader of a council. My council's town hall had a leader's office and I probably sat in there about once every eight weeks for a group meeting. I suspect that my equivalents in other authorities—especially, perhaps, those controlled by Opposition parties—met more often. That is their decision; they choose how to arrange their council duties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. We could have a party political shouting match—that might be amusing—but it would not get us much further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a difference between how my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire) might wish to run a local authority and how many Opposition members might wish to run one. The question is whether that difference should be paid for by the ratepayer or whether it should be done at the cost of those whose decision it is to run a local authority in that way. That is the point I wish to discuss, but first I shall give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it should be remembered that others here were councillors before the 1974 reorganisation. What has happened is that panels, working parties, sub-committees, joint committees, advisory panels, systems for nominations to other organisations, and so on, have been set up. I recollect when the leader's office was not what I should call a leader's office—he was there, but he had no secretarial assistance and, in most cases, no payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For some time I have considered that there is a valid argument for local government to meet only in the evenings. That would enable far more people to stand as members. The argument which people express—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

mentioned something about which I have always felt strongly. I have tried to impress it on my own local authority, which is not very good about holding its meetings in the evenings. That is a pity because I think that it stops some people from standing for election to it. Incidentally, that local authority has only a few meetings because it runs itself rather well.

The issue is whether it is reasonable to have a system of remuneration which encourages councils to sit for long hours and have extra meetings, or to have one which enables people to stand for election who could not do so otherwise, without encouraging such activity. That is the issue which the Widdicombe report considered, and I suggest that hon. Members refresh their memories and re-read paragraph 6.82 which says:
	<br><q><p>"Concern has been expressed by chief officers that some committee chairmen are increasingly becoming involved in the managerial minutiae of service departments, exercising more influence (or even full control) over committee agendas, the content of reports, staff appointments, the letting of contracts, relations with the workforce, etc."</p></q>
It is a real issue and it is extremely difficult to deal with because it is part and parcel of the concern about the morale of local government officers in many local authorities who feel that their job is increasingly being done by elected members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take the hon. Gentleman back to what he said about councils being encouraged to meet in the evening? Meeting then would be impractical for a number of councils, such as Strathclyde Tayside and Highland regions, which cover thousands of square miles. It would be impractical for councillors to drive to evening meetings if they had a four hour drive back home at the end of the meeting at 10 pm. It is irresponsible of the Minister to suggest that councils should be encouraged to meet in the evening. Becuase of the size of the area which many of them cover, they must meet in the daytime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not irresponsible of the Minister to say that. There are many areas in England and Scotland in which that would be perfectly practical, and the hon. Gentleman is right to say that there are other areas where it would not be practical. I am only saying that there has been a tendency not to have evening meetings because it is becoming the view of many people involved in local government that local government should have more of a managerial than a directing role. We have to face that difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Franks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not quarrel with most of what my right hon. Friend says, but is not the real issue whether politics, at local or national level, should be for the gifted amateur or a respectable profession? I do not quarrel with his analysis of what goes on in local government, but what training does anyone get before becoming a representative on a local council? Does he get any more training than a Member of Parliament gets before he is elected? We must regard politics as for the gifted amateur or as a respectable and proper profession; there is no middle ground.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>388</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend points to one of the fundamental distinctions in politics. Training is not provided for Members of Parliament because they are seen as being representative over a very wide range of issues. Even on this Committee, there is much difference between Committee members, and so there should be. There is therefore a problem about treating the activity of Members of Parliament as commensurate with other activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am one of those who hope that we can still have Members of Parliament who see their job as a fulltime permanent job and who have no other job, and Members of Parliament who feel that they ought to have connections outside the House. It would be a sad House of Commons if there were not both types, but I know that Opposition Members have a different view. I am not sure that this bears directly on the issue before us, except tangentially in the comparison that is being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have to nail my colours to the mast and say that I do not believe that local councillors should be paid a salary. I do not regard their work as salaried activity. I believe, however, that some expenses, such as travel expenses, should be paid. It is reasonable to provide allowances so that people can make good the losses that they would otherwise incur. The hon. Member for Brightside rightly said that if there were no such allowances, it would restrict the ability to represent in a voluntary capacity to certain types of people, such as the retired, or those holding certain types of jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are so many issues that I wish to raise that the Minister should perhaps wait until every hon. Member has contributed to the debate before summing up. First, most London borough authorities hold their meetings in the evening although the Greater London council had to meet during the day. Secondly, I noticed that the Minister did not argue for Members of Parliament not to be paid a salary. Third, those Members of Parliament whom he so graciously said kept contacts outside do not do it for nothing. They do it for fat fees and not for the sort of money that councillors would receive as remuneration. Any Member of Parliament who does not consider his job as full time should not be a Member of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and I have a different view about that. I know that he and his hon. Friends continually gripe about it. The House of Commons has always been composed of different types of people doing different things. The hon. Gentleman is always keen to fit everyone into his own mould. It is an attractive mould but it is a one-off and most of us do not want to fit into it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. Is it in order for my right hon. Friend the Minister to make the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) blush?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

wish to detain the Committee any longer but I wish to draw attention to three issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree with the principle that is contained in the paragraph in the Widdicombe report that he read out? If so, we are merely suggesting that it should be updated. There are many evening meetings within local government because three councillors who have taken the place of 18 now have to meet school governors, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency there is a great deal of shift work. What difference does it make if a person works afternoon or nights? The only difference is that if officers meet at night they are not available during the day because they would have to take time off in lieu. The first part of the Bill dealt with officers being available to meet the public. The Minister is confused. He is not aware of what is happening in local government. He should accompany me to find out what it is like.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that I do not need to accompany him and his charming wife. I met him at his local railway station on my way to meet member of Wakefield council only yesterday. He knew where I was going.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister told me that he was going to meet pig farmers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that I met the council's Labour leader and his officers. The hon. Gentleman should not make simple, snide remarks. I then went on to Calderdale council and met its Labour leader. Both were a good deal more polite and helpful than the hon. Gentleman has been this morning. However, I still say that Suffolk Coastal district council could meet in the evenings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make three points. First, the jobs of directing the council in policy matters, should involve as little interference in the running of the council as is possible. A system of allowances which laid a premium on the number of meetings held, the number of sub-committees and the number of working parties would end up with, for instance, committees on Irish women. Such a committee in the London borough of Ealing investigates the deprivation of Irish women in Ealing and receives a report which it puts forward to a further subcommittee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tottenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is wrong with that? Irish women in Ealing pay rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has no place in the sensible running of Ealing borough council. A women's committee must find something to do, so it sets up sub-committees, such as the committee on Irish women, which sets up a sub-committee on the deprivation of Irish women. The ratepayer is supposed to pay for not only the officers servicing those committees, but the councillors sitting on them. That is unsatisfactory and I hope that these arrangements will prevent that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>390</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My wife is doubly insulted by the activities of the committee on Irish women in Ealing. First, she is part Irish and feels it is unnecessary. Secondly, as a ratepayer, she has to pay for the privilege of having that committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a true point. My wife, who is not Irish but lives in Ealing, wonders why the Irish have been selected. There is no committee investigating the deprivation of Suffolk women or Yorkshire women living temporarily in Ealing. Such committees are a temptation because they provide a mechanism by which payment is made. That is not the right way to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is that under a voluntary local government system, we would have to ensure that the burden of the day-to-day administration was not so great that it put out of court anybody who did not want to work on a full-time or almost full-time basis. In many large authorities, the only prople who can do the job are those who work full-time. Oddly enough, the system of remuneration allows the retired or those who do not have a job to take part and they make it even more likely that the work is done on a full-time basis. Political parties of all persuasions are finding it more difficult to get candidates because it is not a part-time but a full-time job to provide this service for the community and they receive only part-time help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point is that the Widdicombe committee suggested that the allowance for the special responsibility of running a senior committee or being the leader of the council should be based on the numbers of hours necessary to do the job and not the number of hours clocked up. That matter should be discussed by the Department and local authorities. A committee is considering the future remuneration of local government representatives. The issue is being discussed, as is the question of the hon. Member for Brightside about whether there should be different classes of remuneration for different sorts of authority. A range of issues is being discussed. Despite the Government's response in the White Paper, the committee can discuss other views and attitudes. I am looking forward to receiving its conclusions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not willing for the regulations to propose the payment of councillors, which I do not believe is the right way forward. I hope that we produce a system of support that will enable people to do the job as part-time volunteers but with help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister says that he does not agree with the payment of councillors, does he mean that the Government do not agree with the payment of a basic flat rate as recommended by Widdicombe?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The White Paper said that the Government were in favour of a flat rate payment rather than a payment for attendance. I am not in favour of the payment of a wage. A flat rate payment would be not a payment for being a councillor but a contribution to the expenses of being a councillor. There is a fundamental distinction. If that is not clear, we shall make it so in our regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0634">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>391</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I notice that the Minister does not argue that Members of Parliament should not be paid. If we had been present for the debate on the payment of Members—I feel as though we have been in Committee since the beginning of the century—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That proves my point. Even though I have been away I feel as though I have been here since the turn of the century. Nothing has changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have served on more than my fair share of Committees. I say as a serious point that it is customary for a Minister to way until contributions have been gathered in and then to try to respond in full. We get a better flow of debate. Members of the Committee do not wish to keep intervening in the Minister's speeches because he can resist everything but temptation. In turn, there are other contributions to which he rightly feels that he must respond. I realise that the Minister is inexperienced and overenthusiastic, but it would be better if he waited for a number of contributions form both sides of the Committee and then responded in full.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a great difference between the job of councillors and that of Member of Parliament, but the argument that the Minister advanced in principle would have been advanced but those who said that being a Member of Parliament should not attract payment because of the public interest and the concept of public service. It is easy for Conservative Members to argue for non-payment when many of their councillors and Members of Parliament can draw on private incomes that make it easy for them to say, "We don't need any allowance."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As leader of the GLC, Sir Horace Cutler made it obvious that he did not need to claim his allowances although, knowing Sir Horace, I bet he did. He seemed to own half Marbella at the time, so he would have not have deprived himself of a great deal of income by forgoing his allowances. Where is he now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzie Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Marbella?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or being detained at Her Majesty's pleasure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will say this for dear old Sir Horace. He was firm on one thing. He said that councillors should claim that because they did a job and should take the allowance offered for it. However, the Minister makes it sound as if councillors go into Government service only to obtain the allowances, which is palpable nonsense. Even given the great self-denying ordinances that flash round this place, I cannot believe that many Members of Parliament would work for the hourly rate that councillors—Conservative, Labour or Liberal—receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Widdicombe report says that the average time spent by councillors on the largest authority was 1,548 hours per year. That would be typical of an authority such as mine in the London borough of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>392</span>
Newham, which is the third largest London borough employer. The average allowance claimed by members on large authorities was £2,112 a year. I work that out to be £1.36 per hour. It is nonsense to suggest that councillors are in it for the money. If one is looking for a nice little earner, the local authority is not the place to find it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the Minister rejected the idea of a proper salary for elected members of local authorities. If we were to deal with the issue properly rather than simply entertain legislation that panders to Conservative prejudices, we should consider employing people on a full-time basis. On smaller authorities. The structure would then be more sensible. At the moment, that does not happen. It is a grotesque slur to suggest that councillors do the job to make money and arrange extra meetings with that motive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Franks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No matter what the hon. Gentleman says, we are all aware that spurious meetings are arranged, but the hon. Gentleman should determine why that is so. The attendance allowances have to be gained so that councillors receive proper remuneration, which they should receive in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That depends on the earning levels of individual councillors—assuming that they have jobs. Circumstances vary for different councillors and different authorities, which is why the generalised onslaught on councillors and attendance allowances is wrong. Personal circumstances differ. I was not a full-time councillor, because I wanted to continue my career in the trade union movement. If I had contemplated giving up my job in the trade union movement, I certainly could not have maintained my family or kept up my mortage payments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Conservatives give the impression that loads of meetings are being called so that members can claim more money, but the maximum that one can claim is £18.25 per day for a meeting of over four hours. Therefore, it does not matter how many meetings are called, or how long members sit in council meetings, the maximum that one can claim is £18.25 per day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I suppose that depends on whether the meetings are grouped or strung out. If one attended one meeting every day, one could claim the allowance on a daily basis. Meetings do not have to last more than four hours. The full allowance can be claimed in some authorities even if a meeting does not last for four hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact remains that the maximum that one can claim in any day is £18.25, so if one had 30 meetings a day, one could still earn only £18.25.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far be it from me to argue the Government's case for them, but the Government suggest that that may be so on a per day basis. However, if one had five meetings a week instead of two, one could claim five times the allowance. That
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0635">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>393</span>
is where it all becomes ridiculous. We should be discussing the intricacies of local authority business. That is what this place has been reduced to. I used to say that the House was a mega twon hall, but we are not even that. We were discussing parish councils a short while ago—we interfere in the minutiae of local authority business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister accused councils of interfering in the management of their local authorities, but at least they have the right to do so. I maintain that we do not have the right to interfere so precisely in the affairs of local councillors. It is nonsense and it makes us look stupid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that councillors twin-track because they get good allowances from the council to which they are elected as well as pay from their employers. Research by the Widdicombe committee refutes that argument. It states:
	<br><q><p>"72 per cent. of all councillors, had a reduction of wages or salary when absent from work on council business. 40 per cent. of meetings started at 7.00 pm or later, 60 per cent. started before … Attendance allowances have not been significantly increased since 1974. They are long overdue for an overhaul, which is what NCZ proposes … From 1974 to 1988 the RPI went up 275 per cent., average earnings 412 per cent. and for MPs 401 per cent. Attendance allowance went up from £10 to £17.55p, an increase of 75.5 per cent."</p></q>
The Minister said that local authority councils are becoming involved in more business. My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) gave one reason for that; we already know the others. The GLC was forced to go into almost permanent session because of all the changing rules and regulations from the Department of the Environment. Rules changed daily, so we were forced to sit at county hall every day. My job suffered. I was elected to be a councillor and because of all the obstacles that the Conservative Government put in my way, I had to spend far more time in county hall than I would have chosen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's memory is slightly at fault. When we sat on the Greater London council day in, day out, and through the night, it was during the period of internecine warfare between the leader and deputy leader of the Labour party in the GLC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman exaggerates. It was comradely disagreement, nothing more. Those daggers in backs were only joke daggers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is scandalous that the London residuary body now occupies county hall. It does not even work very hard. It comprises a few full-time and part-time members. Yet the chairman of the London residuary body, Sir Godfrey Taylor, can claim £57,500 a year to run down the GLC and disperse its services. The per diem rate on an annual basis for being a part-time board member of the London residuary body is about £7,500—for working one day a week. Of course, such members can take a generous lunch break and lunch is provided free. That must be contrasted with hard-working councillors who worked in county hall when it was in the hands of a democratically elected body. That is the hypocrisy that makes me so wretchedly angry when the Minister comes out with sanctimonious claptrap.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>394</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we talk about hypocrisy, is the hon. Gentleman aware that is was only while a Labour Government were in office that allowances for concillors were not increased? The previous Conservative Government increased them, as did Conservative Governments after them, but during 1974–77, when the retail price index increased by more than 80 per cent., nothing was done. The principal reason was that the Labour Government considered that the allowance was already too high. What does the hon. Gentleman say about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They were wrong. They were as wrong then as the Minister is now. It makes it no better. When talking of service and payment, we must keep the discussion in context. New clause 2 allows us to advance in a more sensible and rational fashion, and I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Franks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have considerable sympathy for new clause 2. Until the debate is concluded, I shall reserve my position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The import of new clause 2 is far wider than this particular issue. The real issue is whether we are to regard the politics in local government—and in national Government—as being for the gifted amateur, or whether we recognise the profession of politics for what it is and put it on a proper, recognised, legitimate and respectable basis. I have often wondered whether one reason for the poor national economic performance, and for the poor performance in local government, has been that we alone in the whole world regard politics as something dirty and disreputable, and not something that honest people do. We demean ourselves, as Members of Parliament and as local government representatives, in the way in which we recognise and reward the profession of politics. We demean ourselves in the House with the facilities that we give ourselves, or to be more accurate, that we do not give ourselves. We have to beg and scrounge for a telephone line and for fax facilities. The same occurs in local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is that how we want local government to be ordered for the next decade, the next generation, and the next century? I do not want to see the system continue. I do not want to see the constant deterioration of the calibre of the local government representative. It applies both to Opposition parties and to Conservative Members. The overall calibre of the local government representative is deteriorating rather than improving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first local government legislation, passed in 1835 or 1837, instituted the framework of local government. It is easy to see that the concept then was of the local squire who would toddle down the road to the town hall or parish hall and spend half a morning, out of the beneficence and benevolence of his heart, looking after the affairs of the local parish. There was the Dickensian alderman, pot-bellied, waddling along, distributing largesse—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was the concept of local government. Perhaps it was adequate, in those days when local government was concerned primarily with distributing Poor Law payments and with small localised issues. However, as it evolved, it became huge. The Minister was right when he said that the responsibility of local
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>396</span>
government since the second world war has diminished in many ways. When I first became a member of a local authority, it was responsible for such matters as electricity, water, gas, transport and rivers. Over decades successive Governments have whittled away the responsibilities of local government, which was at its peak from 1945 to 1950.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
