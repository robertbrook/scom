<p>[continuation from col 292]</p>
<p>8.45 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not often that one has so long to reflect on one's peroration. I shall bring my remarks to a close, slowly. I hope that the Financial Secretary will have major points of technical discussion with the Inland Revenue to ensure that the proposals are as lacking in restriction as possible. In a sense, there is nothing new in a fiscal context. There were case law provisions for tax deductibility of corporate contributions to employee benefit trusts, and they still exist. Will case law continue to pertain? The change is that there is now a statutory recognition of the form of employee share ownership trust, which is identified in the Bill and has those qualifying conditions. Those of us who wish to see an extensive spread of the ESOPs principle are worried that the qualifying conditions are drawn too tightly in relation to options, start-up companies and the composition of trustees.<br><br>
There is also concern about the CGT implications, to which I referred earlier. They should be examined carefully, as they could act as a disincentive to a trust that was fulfilling the important role of acting as a market maker, or even as a jobber, between workers leaving the company and those coming in. An employee benefit trust has a role other than that of getting the shares to the employees as quickly as possible, which is to ensure that workers have the opportunity to sell when they leave and that new workers have the opportunity to buy. As there may be a difference in price in those transactions, I urge the Financial Secretary to examine the CGT implications.<br><br>
Employee share ownership can make a great contribution to the broadening of the spread of capital. The arguments were well rehearsed this time last year, so I shall not repeat them. The Financial Secretary has introduced a tremendous advance in the provisions. I heartily commend them and hope that he will consider my reservations about some of the details in the qualifying terms that he has laid down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pontypridd)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to echo some of the sentiments of my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown). Share ownership will do more than spread the ownership of capital; it will do much to encourage a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 294</span>
renaissance for sections of British industry. It is a way forward that stands in great contrast to British industrial relations in the past. There are possibilities, which will do as much to cheer the Opposition as the Government. In many of the new manufacturing industries, the attitude of trade unions towards research and development and investment could be more serious. At present, they tend to feel that, like employers, they must just look after their own corner. Share ownership will allow workers, whether in planning offices or on the shop floor, to see the benefit of promoting the best interests of the firm.<br><br>
Perhaps the legislation should make it easier for shares to be spread in this way. It should allow accessibility, for which it does not provide. We should be careful about attempting to introduce the concept that people must be part of an established firm, rather than saying that there are possibilities for share ownership in a firm and people should join because they can contribute immediately towards its well-being. People need not stay in a firm until they become part of the establishment. They can move if they feel that they can be constructive in shaping a company's future. Share ownership is a way in which that constructive element can find a target.<br><br>
While I agree broadly with the thrust of the provisions, I have great reservations because they are not positive enough with regard to new employees and to transfers of employees between firms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the provisions, which will help to ease the way to the creation of more ESOP schemes. In the United States, 10 million workers participate in some 10,000 such schemes. The fact that there are fewer than 20 such schemes established in Britain suggests that we can go a long way to develop this mechanism by which workers can have a stake in the finance of their company and involvement in its ownership and control.<br><br>
If there were an element of ambiguity in Labour Members' views, as the Government Front Bench suggested, it was not with regard to the principle of ESOP schemes, whatever they may have thought previously. Along with the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown), I welcome the Tyne and Wear Busways ESOP scheme.<br><br>
There was a slight ambiguity in the hon. Gentleman's comments about whether employees looked to the scheme for any dividend or capital appreciation. The hon. Gentleman argued that employees did not do that, but participated in the scheme because it gave them a stake in the control of the company. I do not think that we can separate those two factors. The hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) seemed to argue that employees should be looking not for control but for the ability to participate. Both elements exist. Why should an employee feel that there is anything wrong or improper about participating in the dividend revenues and the capital appreciation in his equity in the company? At long last, the employee will take his share. Both aspects of share ownership are relevant to the success and merits of ESOP schemes.<br><br>
With regard to the control and ultimate decision-making of a company—I am not talking about the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0173">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 295</span>
day-to-day management—one wonders what would have happened at Rowntree, where there was substantial employee opposition to the Nestlé takeover, if there had been a significant ESOP scheme owning a large sector of the shares. It would clearly have been a major factor in the arguments about the takeover if there had been such high employee commitment to the company. That is something that I would welcome.<br><br>
More things are still to be done. The hon. Member for Esher described some of them earlier. There are probably still some technical obstacles to be overcome if the movement is to achieve some of the momentum that it has achieved in the United States. Aided, perhaps unwillingly in some ways, by the privatisation process which is now assuming a serious and significant role, at least in industries such as transport, it could be a major agency for increasing the ability of employees to share in the profitability and capital appreciation of the companies they work for and for increasing their involvement in the ultimate decisions about the fate of those companies. I welcome those things and I am glad to find them in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to start my speech in the same way as did my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) by supporting the principle of the scheme. Have the Government any idea of the likely take-up on this scheme? Given that tax concessions are involved, the Treasury presumably must have some idea of the sums of money involved.<br><br>
ESOPs are not a new idea that the Government have developed; they have been around for quite some time. The Unity Trust Bank, which is a trade union-sponsored bank, has been active in this field since 1985. Are the Government completely committed to the idea of spreading share ownership so that employees benefit financially and can also be directly involved in the decision-making of the company. There will be quite considerable restrictions on the operation of the scheme. In the United States, for example, the collective ownership of shares is allowed but, as I understand it—after reading through the clauses and schedule 5, it is not always easy for a non-lawyer to appreciate every nuance—collective ownership will not be allowed under this scheme.<br><br>
Do the Government see this rather restrictive scheme as a first step? Will they later extend the possibility of employees becoming involved in such schemes? Surely the stricture which allows only companies resident in the United Kingdom to take part in the scheme cuts off substantial numbers of workers in the United Kingdom. About 600,000 employees of American companies could not get involved in the scheme. Do the Government know how many employees of European Community based companies, or even of Japanese companies which, because of the way that their ownership and registration is structured, are not actually resident in the United Kingdom, will be affected? They all pay tax on their activities in the United Kingdom. Why
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 296</span>
cannot subsidiaries of quoted companies be eligible, as they are under the 1978 legislation? If ESOPs are to be effective, workers must be able to participate fully in the schemes.<br><br>
9 pm<br><br>
I have some questions about the operation of schedule 5 because it still contains some grey areas. There are references, for example, to a majority, or most, of the trustees when there may be six, eight or 10 trustees and they may not form a majority. Do the Government intend to specify an odd number of trustees to enable majorities to be formed? Do they plan to specify the way in which the elections referred to in schedule 5 may take place? Will the trustees have limited terms of office? The schedule implies that they could be removed, so will there be time limits or will they stay until there is a vote of no confidence? How would a vote of no confidence be activated under schedule 5?<br><br>
There seems to be a let-out clause in schedule 5 on opening up share ownership to everyone in the company. I refer to the limitation that would be put on a scheme if the articles of association of the company made limitations on share ownership. That would be a let-out to the company, because the shares would not be available to everyone in the company at all times.<br><br>
I hope that the scheme will be developed by the Government and that they will answer my questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Battle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Everyone seems to be saying that extending employee ownership is to be welcomed, but we should be clear about the context in which it can be welcomed. We could become carried away with the rhetoric because we know that 10 million people in Britain now own shares—that is 22 per cent. of the adult population—and with the illusion of employee ownership. The reality may be quite different.<br><br>
When on 4 May 1989, the Paymaster General was pressed by Opposition Members to make a statement about the number of people participating in share ownership, he drew attention to the fact that water and electricity would be floated in the near future. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] Conservative Members may say "Hear, hear," but I draw their attention to the comments made by Mr. John Banham the leader of the Confederation of British Industry, because he cast doubt upon the fact that the Government were boosting Britain as a share-owning democracy. He is reported as saying that although the number of shares may have risen from 2 to 10 million
<br><blockquote><p>"the proportion of shares held by individuals had actually fallen since 1979.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>When the Tories came to power, private shareholders accounted for 35 per cent. of the value of shares held outside companies, with the rest owned by financial institutions such as insurance companies and pension funds.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Now individuals held only 25 per cent of shares, with most of the post-privatisation investors holding only a few shares in one or two companies."</p></blockquote>
Only a handful of shares are involved. When we say that we support ESOPs, we must be clear about what that means in the context of the whole economy. Mr.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0174">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 297</span>
Banham emphasised that the Government's strategy does not boost share ownership among individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Shaw <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dover)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to delay the Committee or encourage the hon. Gentleman to mislead it, but he is missing a fundamental point in how the Government succeeded in widening share ownership. There are 17 million people interested in the ownership of shares. The difference between the 10 million and the 17 million is accounted for by the large numbers of private individuals who own shares in life assurance companies, pension funds and the institutions about which the hon. Gentleman is complaining. Private individuals own shares directly and indirectly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes almost the same point that I am making. We are discussing whether the words "ownership" and "participation" mean anything. To use the hon. Gentleman's example, those owning the shares do not run the pension funds. Mr. John Banham fears that we live in a world of "takeover bids". We must look at share ownership in the context of the shift towards burgeoning mergers and acquisitions.<br><br>
The Keidanren, the Japanese employers federation, demonstrates that there is a clear difference between what it calls "stake ownership" and "share ownership", between "stakeholders" and "shareholders". Stakeholders include managers, employees, creditors, banks, local authorities, customers and suppliers. If the company is part of a larger group, the parent company would obviously be one of the stakeholders. The stakeholders take precedence over the shareholders. That means that the shareholders do not own the companies, as Conservative Members suggest. One Japanese industrialist, Mr. Nukazawa, says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Ours is not the rugged and brutal capitalism of the eighteenth and nineteenth century. When good management today involves not just production and sales but also integration with the corporate and social environment, a takeover objected to by 'stakeholders' is doomed to fail in the long run."</p></blockquote>
In the world of burgeoning mergers and takeovers, that policy should be set firmly withing the context of the policy of the Department of Trade and Industry. If that policy is to become a reality, Conservative Members should put pressure on the Department of Trade and Industry to ensure that monopolies and mergers legislation enables what is suggested in this policy to happen. Otherwise, people will not own the companies in which they have shares, but will be at the mercy of the "stake owner"—if we can adopt that phrase from Japanese practice—because they will be subject to monopolies and mergers over which they have no control. It is meaningless to suggest that this policy will give the little person in business control over his fate within that business because that will not be the reality.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I am just drawing my remarks to a close and the hon. Gentleman can make his speech after my brief contribution. I hope that the Financial
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 298</span>
Secretary can assure us that, to enable this legislation to have some real meaning, he is prepared to make representations to the noble Lord in another place to ensure that monopolies and mergers legislation has sufficient bite so that the little person can own the company in which he has shares and not be dominated in the world of monopolies and mergers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald <span class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a few points in support of my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle).<br><br>
First, we welcome the fact that the Government are following the lead set by the Unity Trust bank. Secondly, the proposals contained in the clauses contradict the Governments' overall philosophy. They are instituting what on other occasions they would call tax distortions not for economic reasons, but simply as a means of social engineering. We shall remember that when we are in Government and are pursuing social goals.<br><br>
Thirdly, I wish to reinforce the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West.<br><br>
We have often heard the Government and Conservative Members talk about the growth of individual share ownership and the growth of shareholder democracy. Such phrases are nothing more than a fig leaf hiding the Governments' real policies. My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West showed how the importance of individual element in the shareholding democracy is belied by the evidence. Government propaganda conjures up an image of millions of individual shareholders spreading throughout the country. However, the number of personal shareholders is vastly eclipsed by the number of institutional shareholders.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West gave figures which showed that the institutional sector had squeezed small individual shareholders from the position in which they held 35 per cent. of shareholdings in 1979 to 25 per cent. in the latest figures. That compares with a figure of 56 per cent. in 1963. Therefore, there has been a dramatic decline in the number of individual shareholders and a dramatic increase in the number of institutional ones. Under the Government, we have seen the growth of an institutional shareholding system and not the growth of an individual shareholding democracy.<br><br>
The democracy part of the Government's equation is enough to make the cat laugh, let alone Labour Members. The hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) gave the game away when he said that spreading the capital-owning democracy—I think that was his phrase—should not be confused with workers controlling their own companies—so much for democracy and the Government's rhetoric.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I clarify my remarks for the record? In the process of workers acquiring shares they may ultimately own over 51 per cent. of them and therefore gain control. That has already happened and the most obvious example was the National Freight consortium in its early days. However, the important point is that private companies will often start at a low level of transfer,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0175">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 299</span>
and that is to be welcomed because it is also part of the spreading of worker participation and capital.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the hon. Gentleman's conversion to the cause of workers' control and I hope that that spreads to the Government Front-Bench spokesmen.<br><br>
There is a long way to go before this country's industrial ethos is changed for the better. The Government have taken the wrong path, thinking that they can achieve the necessary changes by waving the stick of trade union legislation and offering the tiny carrot of schemes such as ESOPs. This country is still mapped out in the West by matters such as the indignity of separate canteens for management and workers. So long as we have that kind of reflection of the ways in which industrial relations are conducted, we still have a long way to go.</span></p>
<p>9.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for an opportunity to take up the challenge proposed by the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) to make a short contribution to the debate. I do so following his remarkable erudition of his international tour. I shall make the intervention that I would have made in a moment.<br><br>
First, may I share with the Committee my favourite political slogan, which was enscribed on the medieval walls of my university city some years ago but left a great mark on my mind? I simply said: "Less property". I have always found that an interesting assertion. The Conservative party seems to be arguing for more property—we want people to have more influence on their lives, more say about what they can do, and a greater participation in the control of their affairs. To achieve that is an imperfect and difficult task, but a task made much easier by a wide dissemination of property and interests, at all levels and in many different ways. If Opposition Members challenge me to say whether I support a share-owning democracy, I shall say that I do, but that does not preclude me from supporting ESOPs, pension funds, or other intermediate vehicles for share holding and for having a stake in the country.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) has already said in interventions, those are the ways in which many people participate, in part or in total, in the capitalist economy. That is to be welcomed, and the ESOPs, as a new wheel on the coach, are to be welcomed too.<br><br>
That brings me to the intervention that I would have made a moment ago. Any system, whether capitalist or not, gives rise to the strains of change. When Opposition Members want to say how terrible the impact of industrial change is, they sometimes pay less attention to the consequences of there being no industrial change—industrial stagnation. Some of them may know quite a bit about that subject.<br><br>
A current case in my constituency shows the crunch of the free market system at its most distressing. The Plessey company, which employs a significant number of people from a small town in my
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 300</span>
constituency, is under threat of takeover by two much larger companies. I recognise the problems which cause that, but I also recognise the problems caused by Plessey's advance decision to close one of the works there. I have discussed that at length with management and unions, and we have tried to produce some sensible solutions and to put some points to the board. But at no time has there been any intention—from them or me—to close the door on change. Change is distressing and difficult, but it must be allowed to happen. It cannot be wished away on the assumption of a Utopian system.<br><br>
May I suggest to the Opposition, especially the hon. Member for Leeds, West, who took us around Japan and points east, that there are equivocations and difficulties even in Europe. I read this week that an Austrian bank is to take a 49 per cent. share in Tungsram, which is the most efficient Hungarian industrial company, best known for its light bulbs. Is that capitalist takeover of, or taking a stake in, a Communist company a good or a bad thing? Is it good or bad for its work force? I believe that it is a good thing, because apart from anything else—as the press report commented—it will ensure that the company has a modern accounting system, which under Communism it does not.<br><br>
Opposition Members who complain about the impact of capitalism and belittle the importance of shareholding and the chance to have a stake in the capitalist economy are fundamentally paternalist. They do not recognise the importance of wealth creation and do not accept that even if wealth is shared imperfectly and changes in the economic system give rise to unfairness and distress, capitalism is a much better system of delivering the goods than any other system. That is understood not only in this country and by our electorate but by those who are now, for the first time, beginning to express their views in democratic elections in eastern Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Lewis Moonie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kirkcaldy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand what you meant about allowing a wide-ranging debate, now that I have heard that contribution, Mr. Cormack. I suppose that I shall just have to do likewise and take full advantage of your generosity.<br><br>
It is interesting to hear John Banham being quoted so often by Labour rather than by Conservative Members. Some of his recent pronouncements could bear careful study by Conservative Members. It is rare to find so many people in agreement on an issue. I suppose that we shall have to learn to call the new schemes ESOTs, which is a horrible acronym but the one that the Chancellor has lumbered us with. ESOP at least has some classical connotation—although with a different spelling. However, there is no doubt that there is general agreement with the principles of the schemes.<br><br>
I was also interested to note the conversion of the hon. Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw) to our views on ownership, particularly in his reference to indirect ownership. That is what we have always said about public ownership of companies—the fact that everybody has an indirect stake in them would maximise the number of people with a say in them, to apply his logic.</span></p>

Gentleman that as I said earlier, there are about 10 million direct shareholders who have every opportunity at annual general meetings. I frequently take part both as a shareholder and as a director who stands the risk of not being re-elected. So far, the shareholders in the companies in which I am involved have had the good sense to go along with my staying on the board, but that may not always happen. About 7 million more people, in addition to those 10 million—some 17 million in total—are investing through pension funds and insurance policies. I have a life insurance policy, as, no doubt, do many other hon. Members. We have a choice. We can vote with our feet as between the companies, on their performance and on whether we like their policies. There are now collective investment schemes and ethical schemes, whereby people can invest according to what they want. The choice has never been greater. The Government have made many more people direct and indirect shareholders.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said, there can be a narrow or a wide definition of indirect ownership. Clearly, the hon. Member for Dover wishes to make it rather a narrow one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has one of the arguments in favour of direct ownership not occurred to the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie)? If not, he and other Opposition Members may have had a yearning—or may even have carried out that yearing—to attend a Barclays annual general meeting and to participate in the annual ritual attack on Barclays' participation in South Africa. Some of them may even have claimed the credit, as shareholders, for putting pressure on that company to change its commercial practice for South Africa. The capitalist system should not be written off.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That contribution is being greeted with delight, if not ecstacy, by most Conservative Members.<br><br>
The Labour party is in favour of employee share ownership trusts. Indeed, that has been my view for many years, sponsored as I am by the Co-operative party and involved as I am in the co-operative movement. Reference has already been made to the founding role of the Unity Trust bank in promoting such schemes, which are still in their infancy in this country, despite attempts by that bank to promote them—for example, in buy-outs involving part of the public transport industry in Scotland. We can only hope that it succeeds.<br><br>
Increased employee participation brings problems as well as benefits, and it is worth concentrating on some of them. If we allow employees to build up a stake in the company, the logical outcome is that they may control a majority of shares in the company.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 302</span>
That will lead to conflicts in the traditional roles of labour and capital and will blur the present, clear distinctions or interests of the two groups. The potential for difficulty has not been properly thought through. We have not yet experienced it in practice, but we shall.<br><br>
If we are to encourage workers to use the power that they generate through share ownership, we must recognise that there will be consequences. Some may be beneficial. It always seems illogical that additional rewards, other than wages or salaries, should be the prerogative of management, not the work force. Diversification of sources of income will ultimately lead to changes in industrial practices. For example, when workers are concerned with the capital growth of their company and of their stake in that company, they may adopt different attitudes. If sufficient emphasis is placed on such a scheme, it may affect inflation, because the work force may accept a capital increase by way of reward, rather than the year-on-year wage increase. There will be a blurring of workers' loyalties and of their traditional adherence to some forms of bargaining. Although that may be seen as potentially good, the difficulties should not be underestimated.<br><br>
Secondly, conversion to the idea that capital growth of a company is good will benefit industry in general. If the majority of share owners ultimately believe, as they do in Japan, in capital growth rather than in growth by acquisition and short-term dependence on dividends, as they often do in Western capitalism, their commitment through employment and savings to the longer term growth of their company can only benefit British industry.<br><br>
Thirdly, the scheme will provide a defence for companies against the predatory bids that we have seen all too often over the past few years in many industries. The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) mentioned Plessey and GEC, but I have a GEC factory in my constituency and I am wholly thirled to the benefits for the telecommunications industry if that merger goes ahead. It will mean that many hundreds of jobs in my constituency that were under threat will be secure. We often have such interests to defend. That highlights the point that takeovers may be seen by some people as a benefit, but may ultimately damage an industry. It would be good if workers had a stake in their company and were able to use their voting rights to defend it against such negative, so-called hostile takeovers.</span></p>
<p>9.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important to recognise that one of the great advantages to employees of having shares in their company is that if it is taken over, the employees benefit in the capital uplift which at the moment is in the hands of only third parties or managers. Leaving aside the other implications for employment, that must be welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given that a takeover is usually of benefit to the company, everyone would accept the hon. Gentleman's point. However, in many takeovers the benefits to the value of shares in the combined enterprise are won at considerable cost to

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 303</span>
workers, who may lose their jobs when companies are sold off or rationalised. The problems caused by asset-stripping or mergers, especially in the leverage type of buy-off that has become common in the USA although thankfully not here, reveal another side to the takeover coin, which companies should take into account before proceeding with a merger. Other matters should be considered, not just the profit and loss balance sheet. We should look at the complete picture.<br><br>
This provision will weaken the effective control of companies by institutions that have little direct, emotional stake in the industry involved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I do not want to correct Opposition Members, but I should say that I am a director of a company which has regular meetings with institutions that are desperately interested in the industry and the company's performance, including how we look after our employees, whether we have an employee share option scheme and whether the employees are motivated. Institutional investors are motivated and interested investors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some institutional investors are motivated; some are not. Often the narrowest interests carry the day when a takeover is considered. It is essential that the schemes are fair, that there is genuine participation by all eligible employees and that they are not just used as an excuse for providing tax-free benefits for a proportion of the work force.<br><br>
We welcome the legislation, although we recognise the problems. The hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) referred to potential problems with the scheme as proposed. Progress has been slow. Schemes should perhaps have restricted membership and there may be problems with trustees. The Minister should deal with such points in his reply. There is no reason why companies controlled largely or in part by the work force should not be effective and efficient users of capital and labour. We should work towards that in the future. These clauses are a step in that direction, but by no means the whole story. In a year's time when we discuss such schemes, we shall need a great deal of information from the Minister about how many have been set up in the intervening 12 months and how successful they have been, so that we can judge the effectiveness of the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) set the tone for the Opposition when he gave the clause a cautious welcome. I am grateful to him for stressing that the Opposition regard clause 64 as a step in the right direction and that they are strong supporters of ESOPs. He spoke of his own experience of privatised transport utilities, which is one area where ESOPs have made significant progress.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) also welcomed the clause. I agree with two of his comments that this is about not only control by the labour force, but having a stake in a company. The element of capital appreciation cannot be divorced from control.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 304</span>
The clause provides a new relief from corporation tax for company contributions to ESOP trusts. Employee share ownership plans involve trusts set up for the benefit of a company's employees, which invest in the company's shares and then distribute them to the work force. The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East correctly said that that is possible under existing tax law. My hon. Friend the Member for Esher (Mr Taylor) also made that point. It had been made clear to us that the lack of clarity in the law was a major inhibition. Furthermore, the lengths and devices necessary to obtain the certainty of corporation tax relief involved much work and expense for employers.<br><br>
The provision does more than clarify; it makes it easier to obtain corporation tax relief. Of all the representations that we received last year—members of the Committee will recall that we debated this last year—I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Esher, but my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr Forman) has also dealt with this theme for some time. It was as a result of the amendments moved last year that I undertook to examine the issue further. When we consulted institutions and pressure groups interested in ESOPs, the uncertainty of tax relief for corporation tax purposes was at the top of the list of problems.<br><br>
There is no precise definition of an ESOP or an ESOT. Like the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie), I prefer to say "ESOPs". He challenged us to face the fact that ESOPs or ESOTs might mean the majority of a company's shares being owned by a trust on behalf of the labour force and ultimately by the labour force. I do not resile from that. In a free enterprise economy, there is room for many different forms of ownership, which can include a number of companies where a majority of shares are owned by the labour force. If the increasing awareness of and interest in ESOPs results in more worker-owned companies, I should not regret that. However, that is not the only definition of an ESOP or ESOT. It can vary from a significant to a majority stake.<br><br>
It is important to remember that ESOP trusts differ from ordinary employee share schemes or profit-sharing schemes in a number of ways. First, they tend to use a wider variety of finance, usually relying on outside borrowing in addition to direct company contributions. Secondly, they can acquire and distribute unlimited amounts of shares, ranging from small amounts right up to the entire share capital of the company. Thirdly, they normally operate on a longer timescale than is possible under improved profit-sharing schemes. Fourthly, in the case of unquoted companies—ESOPs and ESOTs have a particular role to play in the unquoted sector—they may provide a market in the shares for the benefit of employees. That came out of the consultations. My hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Mr. Powell), who takes a close interest in the unquoted sector, might agree that the ESOPs and the ESOTs may be one way of producing more worker participation in share ownership in the unquoted sector. Although we have tried to simply the tax legislation as it applies to share options in unquoted companies, it is still difficult. Anything that could encourage more
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0178">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 305</span>
membership by the work force in the unquoted sector is to be welcomed.<br><br>
We considered all the proposals that have been put forward. There was quite a menu, and my hon. Friend the Member for Esher was to the fore in advancing ideas. We felt that the corporation tax was the frontrunner, and that view was generally shared by those making representations to us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On corporation tax, will the Minister confirm that the Government intend that the qualifying ESOPs will be the beneficiaries of the concessions that are set out in the clauses, and that non-qualifying ESOTs or ESOPs will not be the beneficiaries? Will he confirm that the arrangements that have lasted until now will not last afterwards?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was going to come to that point, because the hon. Gentleman asked me about it earlier. It will still be possible for people to get a corporation tax deduction by the old, rather circuitous, route if they wish to do that. I think it has all sorts of disadvantages, but if people wish to do that it will still be legally possible. Relief will be available under those general rules, but I do not wish to weary the Committee by going into all the details of what they involve. I imagine that most companies would wish to go down the new route in the Bill. To do that, they have to meet the qualifying conditions. The answer to the hon. Gentleman's first question is yes, but the other relief will still exist, too.<br><br>
Several hon. Members referred to the experience of ESOPs in the United States. Circumstances there are different. Many Americans see ESOPs and ESOTs as a financing benefit for companies, built as they are there on a different set of tax reliefs. It is instructive that the proportion of employees who have participated in United Stated ESOPs is similar to the proportion who have benefited here under our approved schemes. We are very much aware of some of the criticisms of some American ESOP arrangements, such as their use in lieu of pensions and benefit funds and as poison pill defences.<br><br>
The growth of ESOPs in the United States is interesting, and we should follow it. It is important that ESOPs should benefit those who work in a company. They should not be devices to enable companies to resist take-overs, and should certainly not be vehicles by which former rich proprietors purport to give control of their companies away to the labour force, while retaining control.<br><br>
Some criticisms have been made of the provisions. One group said that the Government should focus them narrowly because we should develop schemes that "enrich the initiators". I assume that meant the managers. However, that is not the purpose of ESOPs.<br><br>
9.45 pm<br><br>
We have share option schemes, all-employee share schemes and incentive schemes for management. ESOPs are for the benefit of the whole work force of a company and should not be restricted to one particular group. I say that because one of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 306</span>
criticisms of the qualifying conditions is that they are too restrictive. We shall consider that point when we discuss the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Esher. We have laid down several conditions, because ESOPs should be available to all employees on similar terms. I do not want ESOPs to be used in some of the ways in which they have been used in the United States. I believe in incentives for management, but they already exist and we do not need to create another instrument purely for management's benefit. This measure is wider than, and different from, other schemes.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) made several points. I think that I have answered his point about qualifying and non-qualifying ESOPs. He spoke about his experience of the privatisation of some of the bus companies, and I was warmed by his comments. In many places in Britain, not only the north-east, the labour force has either bought the company or acquired a considerable stake in it, as my hon. Friend the Member for Esher knows. That is an ideal way to give the labour force a stake in the company, so I agree with what the hon. Gentleman said.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Esher asked why there was no CGT relief for sales of shares by proprietors. My hon. Friend has discussed the matter with me and knows that it would be difficult to devise a CGT relief that was properly targeted. The legislation would have to be complex to ensure that it was not open to abuse. But the issues go beyond that in terms of capital gains tax roll-over relief. We are always under pressure to introduce such relief in different parts of the tax system. My hon. Friend will understand that I could not do so, as that would be a fundamental step on capital gains.<br><br>
My hon. Friend also referred to the changes that we are making this year on hold-over relief, and wondered whether they would damage ESOPs. ESOPs will be of particular help to the small, unquoted company. Shares in unquoted trading companies are being specifically protected from the CGT changes for gifts. So there may not be as much of a problem as my hon. Friend the Member for Esher imagines.<br><br>
With regard to a double charge, many ESOPs will probably operate through an approved employee share scheme. That will provide tax exemption for the employee, with the result that there will be no double charge. We can keep an eye on those matters. I hope that my hon. Friend will understand why we have taken this position.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) asked about the cost. It is difficult to estimate costs because the take-up is uncertain. However, we expect the costs to be very small in the first few years. In the long term, the cost might be about £20 million a year, but that would depend on the take-up.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about schedule 5 and the position of trustees. There is a requirement that the majority of trustees must be from the work force. That is always arithmetically possible. My hon. Friend the Member for Esher has tabled an amendment on this point, so no doubt it will be debated further. We have not specified a lot of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0179">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 307</span>
conditions hedging in the way in which the trustees should operate; we have left much of that to the discretion of the companies. In general, it should be up to the companies and trustees to decide matters such as the length of a trustee's service, subject to the general law of trusts and the bearing that it has on the responsibilities of trustees. As I have said, we can dedate those points when we come to my hon. Friend's amendment.<br><br>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East and other Opposition Members for giving this new tax relief a cautious welcome. I believe that it is a breakthrough and I hope that it will lead to the development of more employee share ownership plans.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These amendments relate to the charge to tax which will fall on the trustees of an ESOP trust if, after they have received a contribution from a company which qualifies for the new corporation tax relief, they fail to operate the trust in accordance with specified requirements. The tax charge is designed to recover the relief which has, in effect, turned out not to be due. For that reason, we think that it is right to set the rate at 35 per cent.—that is, the basic rate of 25 per cent. and the additional rate of 10 per cent.—which equates with the full rate of corporation tax.<br><br>
The Revenue's press release, issued on Budget day, made it clear that the rate of charge would be 35 per cent. But since the bill was published, it has become clear that the wording is not apt to attract the additional as well as the basic rate charge. The amendments would put that right.</span></p>

Specifically, the tax will apply to trustees who distribute shares to the wrong people—people not specified in their trust deed, such as people who have material interests in the company that set up the ESOP trust. It will also apply to trustees who distribute shares to the right people but on the wrong terms—that is, if they distribute them to qualifying employees but not on similar terms. It will apply to trustees who hold on to shares for longer than the specified seven-year period, and to trustees who incur expenditure for unapproved purposes.<br><br>
Tax will be charged, on any of those occasions, only if the trustees have previously received contributions from a company and the company has had corporation tax relief, as we discussed under clause 64.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments seek to probe the reasons for the current drafting of the Bill, particularly the details in schedule 5, which appear to exclude the use of option schemes, whether they be unapproved or approved under the Finance Acts 1980 and 1984. The drafting difficulties relate to the definition of the qualifying terms test for an employee share option trust and to conditions of transfer. The current drafting excludes options and is unclear.<br><br>
Does my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary accept that there are good grounds for saying that the use of the 1980 and 1984 schemes is desirable within an employee share option trust? Conflicts could arise between beneficiaries of an ESOP because of the different ways in which options are drawn on existing as opposed to new shares. I should like the schemes to be combined so that that potential conflict is avoided.<br><br>
In the real world, there are justifications for enabling the use of options. Vendors could transfer shares more rapidly to employees through employee share option trusts by using options than they could by using a Finance Act 1978 scheme. That is another reason for reconsidering the Bill.</span></p>
<p>10 pm</p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
<p>10.23 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Therefore, in conclusion I point out that amendments Nos. 225 and 226 will enable securities to be part of the qualifying terms of an employee share ownership trust.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend said, the amendments will enable the ESOP trust to distribute shares to beneficiaries in the form of options granted over shares, and of the transfer of shares to exercising option holders.<br><br>
My hon. Friend has argued that a more flexible approach should include the use of options. He spoke with considerable knowledge of the matter, but his approach is complicated and would require considerable amendment of the Bill. I shall not go into the details but I assure my hon. Friend that the amendments are defective and would require others to be tabled. That is one of the reasons why we have not accepted them given the time available and their complexity. I am also sceptical whether there is an enormous demand within the context of ESOPs to exercise them through the medium of options. I am not saying that there is an overwhelming case against that, but I am not sure that there is a pressing need for it.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 310</span>
My hon. Friend is right that the ESOP provisions in the Bill mean that it is unlikely that trusts will be able to comply with the distribution obligations by using share options—whether we are talking about those of the 1980 variety or about unapproved arrangements. First, the ESOP provisions require the all-employee and similar terms conditions to be met at the time when distributions are made. This simple approach does not permit the granting of share options to be regarded as a distribution.<br><br>
Secondly, any distributions when made must be on all-employee, similar terms. But option holders will normally be given a period within which, rather than a time at which, they may obtain shares through the exercise of their options. Some will decide not to exercise; some will exercise early; and some will leave exercise to the last moment. It is very unlikely that all those who were granted options at the same time will all exercise, and will all do so at the same time. We may come across problems because of that.<br><br>
Thirdly, the ESOP provisions require the trustees to distribute shares within seven years of their acquisition. However, option holders are usually required to wait a few years before they are entitled by exercise to obtain their shares—in the case of approved SAYE-related schemes they must wait for at least five years, and may in practice exercise after as much as seven and a half years. This may therefore mean that the trust does not distribute the shares within the required seven years. If the option was granted in the seventh year, the shares may not be distributed until as much as 14 years after the trust acquired them.<br><br>
This was not among the many representations made to us. I appreciate that there are arguments for making it easier to distribute shares through share options, but it would be complicated to do that. However, we shall consider it in the longer term, even though I am not entirely convinced that it is overwhelmingly necessary. My hon. Friend outlined some circumstances in which it might be necessary, or in which it would be easier for it to be done through options.<br><br>
Taking one of his points, if a trust has not had to borrow to acquire its shares, there is no obvious reason why the share cannot be distributed straightaway. If in those circumstances maximum tax relief for employee recipients is sought, distribution through an approved profit-sharing scheme should be possible.<br><br>
On another point my hon. Friend made, if the trust has acquired its shares with borrowed money, the borrowings could probably be repaid simply by selling shares to employees, for a price which might be equivalent to what would be charged otherwise on the exercise of an option.<br><br>
The amendment would be complicated and I should want to examine the case for it. I appreciate that my hon. Friend wants to increase the way in which shares can be released quickly. We can consider that for the future, but I advise my hon. Friend not to press what would be a difficult amendment to get right at the moment.</span></p>

not share his scepticism about the use of options in an ESOP scheme, but I am gratified that he will wait to see what happens and listen to further representations. I accept entirely his point about the complexity of the issue. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>"(2) In the following provisions of this section—
<ol>
<li>'the initial chargeable event' means the event referred to in subsection (1)(a) above, and</li>
<li>'the total outstanding amount' means the total amount outstanding, at the time the initial chargeable event occurs, in respect of the principal of an amount or amounts borrowed at any time by the trustees.".</li></ol></p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 192 and 195 to 197.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a group of technical amendments designed to ensure that the tax charge imposed by clause 68 does not fall on too large an amount. The point of the tax charges that we are introducing is, as I have explained on several occasions, to recover tax relief if trustees fail to operate the trust in the way that they should. It follows that we are ensuring that the amount chargeable to tax on any occasion on any particular body of trustees cannot exceed the amount of tax-relieved contributions they have had up to that time.<br><br>
However, if we left matters like that, there would be an easy way round the tax charge for trustees who were interested in exploiting a particular loophole. They could borrow a large amount and use that borrowing for a non-qualifying purpose. If they had had no tax-relieved contributions up to that time at all, there would be no tax charge when the borrowed money was misapplied. If they had had only a small amount, the charge would be similarly very limited.<br><br>
Later, a company could put them in funds to repay the borrowing and relief would be due for that payment because repayment of borrowing is a qualifying purpose. So corporation tax relief would have been given for a payment which had, if not in form, been used in an unapproved way. Clause 68 is designed to prevent that sort of device.</span></p>

INFORMATION</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This clause, which is innocently headed "Information", refers to the powers of the Inland Revenue to receive information to determine whether the ESOP has been run properly. It refers also to the penalties set out for non-compliance. It is right to have penalties. The Revenue should be protected when an ESOP is run improperly by the trustees. We have just accepted clauses that will put those powers into effect.<br><br>
As the Financial Secretary told the Committee in our more general debate, we are dealing with a new area and it is possible that errors may occur, not through an intention to deceive but because rules are misunderstood and misapplied in genuine error. In those circumstances, I hope that there will be a

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 313</span>
dialogue between the Revenue and the trustees to put matters back on the right lines rather than a move by the Revenue to invoke its substantial powers against the trust, which could damage the ESOP itself.<br><br>
Will the Financial Secretary say what protection there is for trustees if they make a mistake, perhaps because of an ambiguity in the rules? Will the penalties be invoked in all cases, regardless of how the error occurred? We have had a good debate on ESOPs and every member of the Committee who has spoken has wished them well. It would be a shame if people were reluctant to become trustees because they thought that they could get into more trouble than they could handle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In this clause we are discussing the information powers rather than the tax charge or penalties that might fall on these trustees as they do on any trustees. There has been much talk about the onerous responsibilities of trustees. That is true, but it is true of all trustees.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked what would happen in the case of error. Of course, the Revenue would be prepared to discuss it as it would with anyone who was in error. However, the law must take its course. It is possible for a company to guarantee borrowings even if recourse is to the trustees. We shall discuss some of these issues when we debate an amendment relating to the composition of the trustees. The obligations placed on trustees are not out of line with those placed on trustees in general. There is no disincentive to be a trustee of an ESOP. The Revenue will approach error sympathetically but it will have to be dealt with ultimately.</span></p>

EMPLOYEE SHARE OWNERSHIP TRUSTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 296, in page 173, leave out lines 1 to 8 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(e) most of the trustees must be persons who do not have, and have never had, a material interest in any such company.".</p></blockquote>
This is another probing amendment to discover why the Financial Secretary has been so exact in his definition of the composition of the trustees for the purpose of an ESOT. The schedule goes into too much detail. It might act as a deterrent to companies, vendors and lenders. The amendment would delete sub-paragraphs (e) and (f) on page 173 but retain the point about material interest in a company. In the difficult early stages of setting up an ESOT there should be a balance between representatives of the employers and employees with the balance of independent trustees agreed between them. There is already a specification for a qualified person under paragraph (3)(c) of the schedule. Will the Financial
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 314</span>
Secretary reconsider this point, avoid going into detail at this stage and perhaps review the matter during the year? The Bill is too specific and may cause difficulties for, or be a deterrent to, those setting up a trust.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 3 of schedule 5 contains rules designed to ensure that the trustees are independent of the company and its other owners or former owners throughout the operation of the ESOP trust. In devising these rules we took account of suggestions about the types of controls needed. Special rules are necessary for two main reasons.<br><br>
First, for several years the trustees will exercise discretionary powers over the use of large sums and volumes of shares, perhaps amounting to control of the company concerned. These trusts are not like some employee share schemes; they are on a larger scale and much more is at stake. Secondly, the trustees will be able to exercise the voting powers of those shares for up to seven years, during which the shares will remain in the trust. So large sums of money may be involved and the trust may be important to the company concerned and to its workers. We should consider how the trust should be set up and who the trustees should be.<br><br>
The trust is a trust for the benefit of employees and our aim in setting out the conditions regarding the trustees was to safeguard employees' interests, not just when distributions are made but throughout the seven-year period when share are held in trust. The concerns of a company's owners and management and the best interests of the body of its employees may not always coincide—as in a takeover. We do not want to incur the sort of criticism heard elsewhere that ESOPs are used as poison pills to entrench existing management.<br><br>
Given that the sole purpose of the trust is to benefit employees, we should ensure that at all times employees' interests take precedence. That is why the provisions stipulate that there should always be a majority of employee trustees, but with an independent professional trustee to provide some expert guidance.<br><br>
These conditions differ somewhat from the limited requirements of two trustees, unless the trustee is an independent body, in the approved profit-sharing scheme legislation. But the trustees of profit-sharing schemes have very circumscribed powers and facilities, in contrast to what is at stake in these provisions.<br><br>
I hope that hon. Members will agree that the provisions were designed with the right aim in mind to ensure that the trust is acting in the best interests and for the benefit of the employees of the company. The shares have been acquired for them, and are to become theirs as soon as possible when borrowings have been repaid.<br><br>
My hon. Friend expressed doubts about our suggestion that a majority of the trustees should have been selected by the work force. A trust is different from more narrowly defined share incentive schemes. It would be difficult to argue that ESOPs were for the benefit of the whole work force rather than for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0183">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 315</span>
the proprietors or managers of the company unless it was clear that a majority of the trustees came from those who worked in the company. The different grades of workers may include managers.<br><br>
10.45 pm<br><br>
Fears have been expressed about control of the ESOP by militants or extreme trade unions, but any company with that sort of industrial relations is not likely to set up an ESOP. For a company with the sort of atmosphere that makes an ESOP possible, the requirements that a majority of the trustees should have been approved by the work force will not prove to be a problem in practice.<br><br>
A number of points have been raised about whether people will be willing to be trustees, and what the risks will be. I dealt with that in part in my reply to the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown), who clearly had some anxieties. I have said that the company can guarantee the borrowings. The obligations placed on the trustees are no different from those placed on trustees generally. I do not believe that banks will be unwilling to lend to ESOPs because a majority of trustees emanate from the labour force. The banks will be aware that the borrowings can be guaranteed by the company.<br><br>
I shall bear in mind what my hon. Friend the Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) has said. As I have said in response to all the amendments, we are getting onto new ground, and we shall watch how the scheme works. If amendment is necessary we shall amend, but I am more inclined to leave things as they are. We shall watch developments and, if necessary, we shall bring forward changes. However, the concept that we have now is probably the right one with which to start.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely convinced by the arguments of my right hon. Friend. This is a classic case in which it would have been better to err on the side of not defining the terms as clearly as they have been at this stage. If there were genuine cases subsequently which appeared to involve abuse, the Financial Secretary could have brought in amendments at a later stage with the benefit of that knowledge. The purpose is to obtain the maximum flexibility.<br><br>
In many cases, as ESOP will be set up with the benefit of borrowed money. I am certain that all banks, including that excellent bank Unity Trust, would wish to take into account certain factors in relation to the money that they were lending. They might have their views about the composition of the trustees in the early stages before the tax relieved payments on the corporation tax reached the ESOP, which might not be in the first year or two.<br><br>
Accordingly, I would have urged greater flexibility, but that is the privilege of a Back Bencher who thinks that legislation should perhaps be less rather than more. Given the complexity of any legislation and any case, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 205, in page 175, line 4, leave out sub-paragraph (2) and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2) Subject to sub-paragraph (2A) below, a restriction is authorised by this sub-paragraph if—
<ol>
<li>it is imposed by the founding company's articles of association.</li>
<li>it requires all shares held by directors or employees of the founding company, or of any other company which it controls for the time being, to be disposed of on ceasing to be so held, and</li>
<li>it requires all shares acquired, in pursuance of rights or interests obtained by such directors or employees, by persons who are not (or have ceased to be) such directors or employees to be disposed of when they are acquired.</li></ol></p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li>any disposal required by the restriction will be by way of sale for a consideration in money on terms specified in the articles of association, and</li>

The purpose of the amendment is to align the requirements governing the shares that may be acquired by the trust more closely with those that apply in the case of shares used in the approved employee share schemes.<br><br>
As the intention is that the shares that employees and directors receive as a result of the operation of the trust should be ordinary shares and not a special class of shares or especially restricted shares, a stipulation that restrictions on the shares used are permitted if they are imposed by the founding company's articles of association is insufficient. In aligning this provision with that applying in the case of approved employee share schemes, the amendment has the effect of permitting the shares used to be subject to a requirement that if held by a director or an employee they must be sold on his departure, but only if the terms of such a disposal apply equally to disposals of all shares of the same class by other shareholders.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule, as amended, be the Fifth schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to take up some points of detail, rather than of principle, with the Financial Secretary; it is right to raise them here, as details of the ESOP scheme are set out in this schedule.<br><br>
The first point is contained in paragraph 2(2). It relates to subsidiaries, and it seems to forbid them. If the Financial Secretary were to say that the provision had been inserted to close a tax avoidance loophole, I could understand that, but it seems to be a blanket provision, and the Committee should be satisfied that it is necessary.<br><br>
Secondly, what is the position of people working for subsidiaries of foreign firms based in the United Kingdom? As I read the schedule, it seems that employees of companies that are subsidiaries of firms owned abroad will not be able to participate in ESOP schemes. If that is the case, can the Financial Secretary explain why it was felt necessary to include such a prohibition in the Bill? Paragraph 3(3)(c) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"the trustees must include one person who is a trust corporation, a solicitor, or a member of such other professional body as the Board may from time to time allow".</p></blockquote>
I am not sure what the other type of professional body would be. Obviously a dentist would not be considered appropriate, and neither would an architect or a brain surgeon, but they are all members of professional bodies. If it is intended to mean an accountant rather than a solicitor, perhaps the Financial Secretary can explain why it was felt that that was a proper substitution. The drafting seems slightly wide and may lead to problems.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0185">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 319</span>
Paragraph 3(3)(d) says that most of the trustees must not be directors and paragraph 3(3)(e) says that most trustees must be employees. Will the Financial Secretary define "most"? Is it intended to mean over half, over three quarters, or just a larger majority than any other group of trustees—40 per cent., 30 per cent. or whatever? The language is not clear and may lead to confusion among those who have to interpret the regulations.<br><br>
Paragraph 4(2) sets out restrictions on those who must be included, but also says that other types of people can be included if desired. It says, however, that certain people can never be included, such as part-time workers, those who have worked for the ESOP for a year or less or those who are working in subsidiaries of firms that are owned abroad. There may be a good reason for those exclusions and there may be different reasons for the different exclusions. I should like the Financial Secretary to tell us the Government's thinking.<br><br>
Paragraph 4(3) sets out the parameters of the membership of the trust. It says, perfectly properly, that it must include all those who have worked for the company for five years or more and that it may include everyone who has worked for the company for one year or more. It implies—this may be just a drafting matter—that it cannot embrace everyone who, for example, has two years' or more experience. I suspect that it is not intended, but that is the implication. Can the Minister give us some reassurance about that?<br><br>
Under paragraph 6(2) it seems possible that the founding company's articles of association could enable the company to give workers shares that were either reduced shares or non-voting shares or were of less value than ordinary shares. I am fairly certain that that is not the Government's intention. I took careful note of what the Financial Secretary said when moving his amendment earlier. He was careful to refer to shares that had voting rights. I should be grateful if he could confirm that the Government do not intend the schedule to facilitate anything but the full voting share ownership.<br><br>
11 pm<br><br>
In paragraph 8(3) terms are allowed to differ on pay levels and length of service, so those who earn more have more opportunities and those who have served longer have advantages over employees who have served a shorter time.<br><br>
The paragraph includes the phrase "or similar factors", which is open to a wide interpretation. It goes against the principles outlined by the Financial Secretary, to set up a mechanism that would allow the better salaried members of ESOPs to gain at the expense of those who are more poorly remunerated, who have a shorter period of service, or whatever else could be embraced by the phrase "or similar factors". How does the Financial Secretary envisage that being used in practice?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked a long list of detailed questions rather faster than I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 320</span>
can assimilate the answers. If I do not cover all the hon. Gentleman's points now, I shall write to him.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman raised the question of subsidiaries, which are not excluded under the legislation. They must be included in the founding company's group ESOP. It is possible that the hon. Gentleman confused that with his second point about the subsidiaries of foreign companies. My hon. Friend the Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) also raised that point. We have put in the Bill a requirement that the founding company must be a UK-resident company. If the UK subsidiary is floated off with a majority shareholding, it ceased to be a subsidiary. It is also possible for the company to use the all-employee share scheme or any of the other share schemes and remain a subsidiary of the foreign parent. However, given that there is room for manipulation of the asset value of subsidiaries, we did not think it right to give tax relief to subsidiaries of companies outside the United Kingdom. One tends to think of established companies with established subsidiaries, but it would be easy to create a subsidiary or an off-shore company and manipulate the share value for a particular group of employees. Hence the reason for the restriction that the founding company must be a UK-resident company controlled within the UK.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East also asked about "most", which means a majority, over half. He asked several questions about other professionals. We had in mind accountants and other professional with ESOP experience who were neither accountants nor solicitors. The hon. Gentleman asked whether a founding company's articles of association would allow non-voting shares. He correctly surmised that only voting shares would be allowed and that they would have to be on "similar terms".<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also asked a question about "similar terms" and several others to which I shall reply in writing. I shall read <i>Hansard</i> to check any other queries that the hon. Gentleman may have had.</span></p>
