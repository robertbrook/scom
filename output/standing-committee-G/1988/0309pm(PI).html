</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. John Gummer)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was explaining that the matter raised by the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) about minority parties is one that, of course, causes some difficulty. But there is no satisfactory means of taking decision-making away from the council without creating considerable difficulties. The regulations will overcome many of the problems. I noted the hon. Gentleman's comments, but we also went round that course when preparing appropriate regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If two minority parties had exactly the same number of members, the full council would decide what to do about the services provided by a special adviser. I wondered whether it should be done alphabetically. But that might have been thought to be somewhat biased and party-political as, in most cases, the Conservatives could get the edge, so I threw that idea aside. The regulations will cover that possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right. We can all imagine considerable difficulties arising in special and
	<span class='label label-info column'>302</span>
peculiar circumstances. But surely it is better to allow those rare anomalies to be worked out by the council. We shall make the regulations as helpful as possible. The occasions when councils must make decisions in such peculiar circumstances will be limited. Moreover, as the discussions and statements will be public, that will probably keep within reasonable bounds all but the most lunatic and ludicrous—and they are likely to be extremely small in number.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Truro)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure when the Minister would allow local decisions to be made. As I understand the rules, there is no room for such decisions. I should be happy if it were possible to resolve some differences in that way. But earlier we discussed why difficulties arise in leaving such matters to local discretion. Will the Minister explain that in more detail?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cited several examples of particular difficulty. For example, he said that it would be difficult to decide which group should be regarded as the largest if they were equal in number. He wondered whether each side of a coalition could be given an adviser, thus denying the opposition any representation. The hon. Gentleman asked what would happen—I merely use his example—if the Labour party were dominant and organised itself into two parts, each with a different name, so that both could claim the services of the adviser.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations would remove doubt in many of those cases. How the party group is defined will depend, in part, on what it was called in the election. I suppose that it is possible to imagine a group going to such lengths. But first it must be sure of winning a large number of seats. Secondly, it must divide into two groups before the election and have two discernibly different names for those groups. But that is taking the possibility to an unlikely end and I am not prepared to make special arrangements to meet it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Truro asked what would happen if the numbers were equal. In those circumstances, the council would decide which group was the official opposition. But the two groups might decide to work matters out on a co-operative basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulations would certainly make it difficult for two parties that controlled a council to claim that they were both in control and that one was in opposition for the purposes of getting the adviser. I am sure that we can deal with such possibilities. A few problems might be wholly outwith the regulations, but I suspect that as all such matters will be out in the open, that will be a ready and clear check on how people behave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that problems might arise, but our proposal seems to be the best answer, without overcomplicating the matter. But if the hon. Gentleman has other suggestions—short of increasing the special advisers to a ludicrous number—I should be happy to consider them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall perhaps disagree on the number of advisers who might be needed.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0586">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>303</span>
There is one suggestion that could meet one of those possible difficulties. No doubt the Minister has considered it; I should be interested to hear his comments. Suppose that there are four groups, two of which are fairly small—that is not uncommon—but the same or a similar size, or suppose that there is one large group and several smaller groups, some of which may be the same size. In those circumstances, why not consider the option of the equivalent of one post divided among those minority parties? For example, with four groups, two might have a full-time special adviser and the two smaller groups—perhaps under the 10 per cent. barrier—might each have a half-timer. Pro rata, the cost involved would be the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My job is not to force people to form various associations and amalgamations to fit the Procrustean bed. I am trying to provide for what will be suitable in 99 per cent. of cases. I recognise that some will fall outside that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the problem raised by the hon. Gentleman and I hope that he notices with what care I try to avoid treading on sore toes. I understand the problems that might arise with varying groups in so many areas that have some adherence to the middle, to put it that way. In my view, it is not the middle; I do not accept the Marxist division of Left and Right. But I shall call it the middle, for the sake of convenience. But because of the middle's vociferation, I understand why the hon. Gentleman is worried about such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is extremely difficult to contemplate a solution that would entail two parties sharing the same person—if not share, have half a person each—under a national code. Surely the following approach is easier. In normal circumstances there will probably be no special advisers. Vast numbers of district councils will have no special advisers at all. But when a council considers that it needs a special adviser, the party in power will have one, as will the main opposition party. When there is a third party with a significant number of councillors—above 10 per cent. of the council—there will be an extra adviser for it. I think that that is a perfectly reasonable way in which to meet the demands of the Widdicombe committee, and it is a move away from the absolutist position that my hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Franks) put forward. Many Conservative Members would prefer us not to make any such arrangements at all. I think that I have produced a reasonable compromise, and that most people outside the House agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must avoid assuming that the reference is to divisions in the centre, because in most cases it will not be like that. Many councils have independent or ratepayer members who, in effect, form a fourth group, and in some cases the independents split up into groups of their own, so there may be even more groups. That is common in my part of the country. There are no SDP councils in Cornwall, bar one, so that is not a concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, in Scotland or Wales there is a separate fourth party, either the Scottish National party of
	<span class='label label-info column'>304</span>
Plaid Cymru, which may also be represented on councils. So there is no more a three-party system in local authorities than a two-party system. Very often there is three, four or even five-party representation on councils, if independents are counted as political parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am merely saying that in those circumstances, the first three parties will get help. No doubt that will often apply to the Scottish and Welsh nationalists, in areas where they have a significant role. It is simply a matter of deciding how big a party has to be before it is reasonable to ask ratepayers to provide that sort of service. I think that the balance that we have struck is reasonable—I do not say that it is perfect—and that it will work in most places and will not fail to work anywhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Truro desperately wants a different system, it would be moving away from the compromise which I think has general support, including the support of those who do not want there to be special advisers at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister now says that the special advice depends on the size of the party group in a council, but that is not true, because he is providing no opportunity for more than three parties to be represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We might argue that a party had to reach a breakthrough point in terms of its representation on a council, but that is a separate issue. For example, the council in Grampian region has representation from four parties, all of which have over 20 per cent. of the councillors. According to the Minister, that council could, if it wished, give a special adviser to the four parties that have over 20 per cent. representation, but the Bill does not provide for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. It is perfectly true that very occasionally another system might be more fitting. My system would be satisfactory in almost every case. I think that it is reasonable and fair and would be easy to operate, so it would commend itself to most people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be the occasional place where, under a different system, one party might sometimes get an extra adviser, which it would not under the system that I propose, and indeed, under the original unamended system, some parties would miss out. I have tried to make this system a little fairer, as I feel that if there is only one or a very small party in opposition, it should not be excluded because it does not have 10 per cent. of the seats, for as the opposition it has some weight to contribute to the council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that in one or two cases some people might feel slightly aggrieved for a short while, but very often it will not be for long because they might become a third party because of the changing number of supporters. Grampian region is an example, and several other councils may be affected. I believe that it is better to have a simple system like this, which fits almost everybody, than to have a complicated one that makes matters extremely difficult for everybody. I think that this system will work well and I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

and, in such a case, it shall be the duty of the authority to determine which of the groups with the next largest membership is to qualify for a post before making any allocation for the purposes of this section to the group with the largest membership.".—[	<i>Mr. Gummer.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 115, in page 13, line 38, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"following consultations with local authority associations".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 116, in page 14, line 9, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"The regulations relating to (a) to (c) and (e) above shall apply to any local authority if the members of that authority do not agree without any member of the authority or committee voting against such local arrangements as they deem fit.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would ensure local authority consultation and involvement in drawing up the model standing orders. The White Paper undertook to initiate discussions with local authority representatives and these would explore the extent to which local government is prepared to introduce changes on a voluntary basis or to agree a basis for later legislation. The working party on which local authority associations are represented, has already been set up, and has met Government Departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper stated that the Government would make statutory provision to be used as a fall back for core standing orders regarding party balance on committees. Those provisions referred to political groups and the White Paper stated that a group in that context would be
	<br><blockquote><p>"any group of councillors who wished to associated themselves for the purpose of the allocation of committee places. Independents could act together if they wished."</p></blockquote>
The clause provides that the Secretary of State may make regulations determining how local councillors are to be divided into political groups, an issue on which we touched earlier. I expressed anxiety about how it would be done, for example, when a councillor is to be treated as a member of such a group, how the question of whether a councillor is a member of a political group should be determined and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultations raise several queries, some about clause 9(9). Will the working group prepare model standing orders to answer the questions about determination or will it be done on an ad hoc basis? If it is on an ad hoc basis—for example, under clause 9(9)(d), an authority is required to review the allocation from time to time, perhaps after an election or a dispute—will the Secretary of State take decisions? If so, it should be in consultation with the local authorities. I am not so concerned about what
	<span class='label label-info column'>306</span>
the working party is doing now; I want to know what will happen in the future. Could the consultative process be made statutory rather than ad hoc?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious about individual cases. We may be told that they will not arise, but if they do I hope that they will be covered by standing orders or regulations and that local authorities will be consulted. I should like the Minister to comment on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the consultation is to take place, I hope that the amendment will be accepted. I see no reason why, if the principle is accepted, it cannot be written into the statute. The Minister has argued that the requirement to consult would hold up legislation. That is a specious argument because we are not suggesting that existing consultation should finish. We are suggesting that in addition there should be a statutory requirement for consultation after the Bill has been enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Different anxieties are raised if the regulations are not to be the subject of discussions with local authorities. We should like to know why they would not be discussed. The administrative organisation of political groupings is essential to the running of local authorities. I am giving the Minister an opportunity to tell us whether the regulations will set out general requirements or whether there will be consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 116 refers to regulations relating to clause 9(9)(a), (c) and (e). I am not sure that, as drafted, it is appropriate to the Bill. It is not quite what I intended when I wrote it. Perhaps that is a failure of my handwriting. However, I shall explain the amendment's intention and if it is correctly worded, there will be no problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim is to allow those local authorities in which there is unanimity to amend the provision of these services. That is necessary for the reasons that I have stated. It takes account of what the Labour party seems to be suggesting, that there should be political advisers for the Labour party in those local authorities that it runs. I agree with the Minister that that should be resisted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the different groups on a local authority agree on how they should be changed and no member of the authority or committee votes against such local arrangements as they deem fit, I find it hard to understand why it should not be allowed. I hope that in this case, the Minister's oft-repeated commitment to local democracy and local solutions—he gave such a commitment in his previous reply to me—will be fulfilled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsections (9)(a), (b), (c) and (e) state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(a) as to the circumstances in which the members of a relevant authority are to be treated as divided into different political groups;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) as to the persons who are to be treated as members of such a group and as to when a person is to be treated as having ceased to be a member of such a group;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(c) requiring the question whether a person is or is not a member of a political group to be determined in such manner as may be provided for by or under the regulations;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(e) specifying the manner in which, and times at which, the wishes of a political group are to be expressed and the consequences of a failure by such a group to express its wishes".</p></blockquote>
Those are difficult issues to determine. If the option is in the Bill, provided everyone in the local authority
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0588">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>307</span>
agreed—the opposition could veto such an arrangement—it would be appropriate to local democracy and provide a way out of a tricky situation if the ultimate sanction is that it is referred to the Secretary of State. He might prefer not to have to deal with it. It ties in with the principle that whenever possible, matters should be resolved locally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mrs. Virginia Bottomley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) said, amendment No. 115 is covered in the Bill. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has agreed to consult local authorities on model standing orders and the regulations in clause 9 will be part of that consultation. The working group will be taking consultations next Monday and will examine the subjects that we have discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will consult local authority associations as part of several consultations that are taking place at the moment. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will welcome that process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the working group is already in place. I am worried about whether there will be consultation when the regulations are published. There should be a statutory requirement to consult at that stage. The question is whether the regulations will be the end of the matter or whether Ministers will have to determine disputes over what constitutes a political group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no statute dictating that we should consult at the end of the process. There will be consultation, but we will publish our findings at the end of the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Truro said, amendment No. 116 would give local authorities power to come to their own arrangements about what is to be counted as a political group, who are to be treated as members of the political group, and how the wishes of the political group are to be ascertained, provided that they did so unanimously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that you were not in the Chair earlier, Sir Anthony. On a number of occasions my reputation has been seriously damaged and there have been accusations about the previous activities and business associations of many of my hon. Friends. It was even suggested that I should resign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did a proper job before I entered Parliament—I was a psychiatric social worker. A great skill of psychiatric social workers is their ability to comment on human behaviour and reactions. I worked closely with a child guidance unit where I was involved in family therapy and the psycho-dynamics of family life. A familiar observation in my previous profession was how often individuals espouse precisely those causes with which they have the greatest difficulty. I hope that the hon. Member for Truro will not think that I am being unduly provocative if I suggest that his pre-occupation with altering the system so long as there is unanimous agreement on the council about the arrangement of political groups seems a little quaint. People in the Vale of Glamorgan will have

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman helps my argument as I explain why this route is not appropriate. Indeed, I understand that the former Member for Leeds, West, Mr. Meadowcroft, is reforming the Liberal party at this very moment. Amendment No. 116 may be superficially attractive, but on examination it proves increasingly flawed and uncertain. Superficial attractiveness is familiar in the policies espoused by the party represented here by the hon. Member for Truro, but in practice they are less effective. Behind his idea are the complex problems of assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if we reached a conclusion about how the various political groups were formed and how they were to proceed, it is difficult to discover what would happen if a new councillor joined the council—for example, after a by-election—and the political arrangements changed. What would happen in the unlikely event that a councillor changed political parties or staged a coup to rearrange the way that parties are represented on the council?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that we have found the most appropriate response to political assistance. Many of the issues have been fully and thoroughly discussed with my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government in earlier sittings. This is the first time that political assistance will be enshrined in legislation. The regulations that the Secretary of State will draw up as part of the model standing orders are the best way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After consultation with the local authorities, we shall introduce a straightforward set of rules to provide the minimum machinery necessary for these purposes. They will not impose complex or elaborate procedures. If a political group wants a more complex system for its own purpose, it will be free to arrange one within its party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We intend the regulations to provide the minimum framework needed to work the provisions, so I urge the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 99 is consequential on amendment No. 98. Other hon. Members may wish to describe the content of amendments Nos. 117, 118 and 119, which do not have a direct bearing on the concerns of my party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I was reflecting on the arrangements set out in amendments No. 98 and 99, I was reminded of the changes in local government during the past 20 years or so. I was first elected in 1971 to the urban district council of Huyton, splendid body of men and women. In those days, it was scarcely necessary to talk about arrangements for time off for councillors, irrespective of whether they were employed by local authorities or by other employers. With the fairly limited powers of urban districts, we could get on with our business without interfering with councillors' employment. Only rarely did I need to take time off work. The powers of the old urban district councils were dramatically different from those of, for example, the metropolitan borough of Knowsley, on which I subsequently represented the Labour party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The really powerful body in those days was Lancashire county council, which was the authority for social services and education and was the body with the greatest power over people's everyday lives. I never served on that council. Because of its volume of work and the geography of its area, the council could meet only during the day, and its councillors had to take considerable time off work. As a result in the early 1970s, until the local government changes of 1974, Lancashire county council functioned
	<span class='label label-info column'>310</span>
because the majority of its members, fine and decent men and women though they were, were mostly retired people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without adequate arrangements for time off, irrespective of whether councillors work in local government or elsewhere, we shall revert to local government that can be manned only by retired people. Those who are unemployed or who live on social security have grave difficulties becoming involved in local government. Their benefits are all over the place and they have to sign on and off on days when they have no meetings. In the not unforeseeable future, the only people who could engage in the duties of elected councillors in metropolitan districts or in many county council areas would be those who were retired or who were prepared to live on a pittance to pursue their political careers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier the Minister said that he thought it best for people who want to become elected members of local authorities to be employed in the private sector. I do not know whether any Tory Members of the Committee have tried in recent times—perhaps from former lofty positions as elected councillors—to obtain employment in the private sector, but I assure them that there are not many willing takers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even people with the most moderate opinions and reasonable approach to life find it extremely difficult to secure any sort of employment if they have become elected councillors. The position gets worse the higher up the local government ladder one climbs. If a person becomes a committee chairman, it is hard and, if he becomes deputy leader, it is harder still. Except when a person is leader, a position that I have not held, it is difficult to secure employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another factor in support of the amendment is that in many parts of the country—certainly in my constituency—the major employer is usually the local authority. We must accept that fact. In areas of high unemployment, anyone seeking employment will find that the most likely potential employer is the local authority. It is certainly true in Merseyside. I am not saying that the entire population of Knowsley has ambitions to become chief executive of the borough council. Many of the 7,500 unemployed people in my constituency would be happy to obtain employment as caretakers or park-keepers or in equally important posts that did not require many qualifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me put a hypothetical case to the Committee, as the Minister is fond of doing. Let us imagine that a member of the Labour party—or the Tory party or SLD, although they are both virtually extinct in Knowsley—finds employment as a park-keeper or caretaker in the borough of St. Helens. He carries out his duties satisfactorily. He is not asked to provide regular policy advice to the inhabitants of the town that employs him. His political views do not interfere with his employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suddenly, because of his political involvement in another borough, he stands for election there and is successful. Those situations occur. I hope that the Committee agrees that it would be incumbent upon the local authority to make reasonable arrangements
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0590">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>311</span>
for that person to have time off to undertake his council duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that the days of the Huyton urban district council are, by Act of Parliament, long gone. We have different types of local authorities from those of the nice, quaint days that I recall. We are in a completely different world. It is sometimes necessary for people to have time off. If they rise up the ladder of local government, it becomes essential to have yet more time off, although how much is debatable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 98 provides that there should be regard to
	<br><blockquote><p>"how much time off is required for the performance of…duties".</p></blockquote>
We have laid stress on the word "reasonable". Members of the Committee would agree that, however the word is defined, it should be possible for a local authority to work out, by negotiation, what is reasonable. We have suggested that if a precedent exists, it should be honoured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We made those reasonable propositions because we know that the difficulties that confront people can be resolved by negotiation. The majority of cases that I have in mind are people employed on technical or non-controversial duties in one authority who are elected representatives of another. If the Minister cannot accept the amendment as drafted, I hope that she will agree with the reasonableness of our suggestion, which was intended to cover decent men and women who wish to represent their community while carrying out paid employment with another authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hear lurid examples of what is alleged to happen in Camden, Derbyshire and elsewhere. The reality of local government is that its people are usually involved in other than politically high-profile duties. They are largely bread-and-butter issues that concern the ward that they represent or that are of great importance to the area. They are usually not of great political significance. I spent 14 years in local government. Most of the agendas of full council meetings or committee meetings contained uncontested items, issues about which people felt no need to be controversial. On occasion, as chairman of the finance committee, I have known even the budget not to be opposed by opposing groups. That is the reality of most local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my former post with Huyton council, the first politically sensitive responsibility I was given was to be made vice-chairman of the highways committee, with special responsibility for the Tufty club. That is the reality of much of the work that people of all political persuasions do in local government. It is not always about Tufty clubs, but the issues are definitely non-controversial. All the same, we ask that they should be given reasonable time off. My borough has a formula. The Committee may not like it. We are not trying to foist it upon other local authorities, but a reasonable compromise can be agreed and it should form part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to add much to the debate. However, I shall speak to amendments
	<span class='label label-info column'>312</span>
Nos. 117, 118 and 119 which were tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, North-East and me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time off is crucial for representatives on larger authorities. The workload of a front bench member of a major authority is considerable, whether he is chairman, holds the balance, or leads for the opposition. I support strongly the aims of amendment No. 98 and, if that is accepted, amendment No. 99. The two are closely tied, as the Committee may be aware.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The three amendments attempt to clarify the difference between the workload that can fall upon a member of a smaller authority, which usually has a much smaller budget, and the workload of people who sit on county, London borough and Scottish regional councils, which have more power and responsibility. The latter have a considerably heavier workload. Metropolitan boroughs are not mentioned in the amendments because they are not mentioned in the Bill, but I assume that they are included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A traditional district can allocate resources of anything between £4 million and £30 million. A London borough is more likely to have a sum in the region of £100 million to £200 million. A county will have a budget of anything between £250 million and £600 million. The scale of responsibility in counties is very much greater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take the example of Chester in the county of Cheshire. If one were to divide the budget between councillors, a councillor on Chester district council would be responsible for about £2,000 a week, while the county councillor serving the same area would be responsible for £140,000. The responsibilities are wholly different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government say repeatedly that they believe that elected members should take responsibility. The Government have been accused of trying to take responsibility centrally and simply using local authorities as a vehicle for local administration rather than local policy making. It is, perhaps, a shift away from elected representatives to bureaucrats, but I do not believe that. The Government believe that councillors should take political decisions on the allocation and have a direct and key role in ensuring that the allocation is made properly and fairly. They are the first line of defence, so they must be given time to do their job properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, if councillors are to exercise their democratic say properly, we must acknowledge that many leading councillors—many of whom are retired—often have to spend two or three days a week making sure that committees are properly serviced. That is particularly true of committee chairmen, but it is true of others, too. Councillors have many duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The burden is falling increasingly on people who are retired, because they are the only ones who have the time to deal with the increasing difficulties and responsibilities of what is now a very technical job. I am sure that the Minister does not believe that local authority work should be confined to people who are retired or unemployed. We therefore need to ensure that people's freedom to take time off without
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0591">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>313</span>
incurring too much expense is not curtailed overmuch. I fear that, if the Government argue that that is reasonable for poorer authorities, they will try to extend it to all local authorities, but I do not accept that the workload and responsibilities of all local authorities are equal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may not accept the allocation of time that I propose, but I hope that he will accept the principle that people who work for larger authorities need more time than is currently proposed. If the Minister does not accept my amendment or one like it, people will stop working for local authorities, and it will become increasingly difficult to find people to replace them. The employment practice of local authorities should be the best possible example to the private sector. After all, they know all the difficulties and burdens that are involved. I hope that local authorities will set a lead, but to do that they need the Minister's permission, and I hope that permission will be given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully endorse much of what the hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth) said. The aim of the bill is, in part, to restore respect for councillors and local government and to make people feel that it is a worthwhile and important way of using their time. The hon. Member said that more and more retired and unemployed people are becoming councillors. The other group of people who frequently become councillors are women, who have husbands to support them. I share the hon. Gentleman's wish that local government should attract as wide a cross-section of the community as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither the hon. Member for Knowsley, North nor the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) said that those who in recent years have increasingly dominated local government are local authority employees, partly because of the extremely generous—on occasion, almost limitless—time that they can serve on a local authority other than the one by which they are employed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does the hon. Lady view the fact that the Widdicombe committee estimated that 36 per cent. of councillors are from the public sector, when that is almost the same as the 37 per cent. of the work force as a whole wo work for the public sector? If, as the hon. Lady said, local government reflects a cross-section of the community, is that not the sort of proportion that she would expect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to comment on those figures. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me if I reminisce, but when I was employed by a local authority, the Greater London council had 47 Labour members—it had, of course, opposition members as well—20 of whom came from local government or similar occupations, many of them voluntary organisations financed by local government, eight of whom were trade union officials, and 13 of whom were pensioners or living on their council allowances. In other words, almost all of them had experience only of the public sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>314</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept those figures. I do not know whether that is good or bad, but I assume that the Bill is not intended to deal with the GLC which, for good or ill, has already been abolished. The Government are introducing legislation to deal with the generality of local government, where the proportion of people from the public sector—which does not include just local government—is about the same as in the population as a whole. I assume that the overall mix is about right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope to develop that argument further, but the hon. Member for Knowsley, North should take note of the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Langbaurgh (Mr. Holt) on Second Reading, when he referred to the personnel officer at Middlesbrough borough council who, once elected a county councillor, was immediately given almost indefinitive leave. There have been many cases of the amount of time taken off by local authority employees to serve another authority causing outrage, if not irritation. The hon. Gentleman referred to a caretaker in St. Helens. The people in Knowsley, where he was a councillor, might be happy for him to take more than 26 days' paid leave, but I would not be happy about it if I lived in a flat on the estate where he was a caretaker.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that the hon. Member for Knowsley, North advances this argument. The well known Derek Hatton may have been a good community development officer or voluntary sector liaison officer for Liverpool where he was a councillor, but I doubt whether many people in Knowsley thought that he was particularly useful in those roles. We must strike a balance between loyalty to the local authority by which a councillor is employed as an officer and loyalty to the local authority on which he serves as a member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tired of repeating myself. I agree that Derek Hatton abused his position. His local authority recognised that and dismissed him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment recognises that the majority of officers are reasonable people who work in reasonable local authorities that are fit and proper bodies to sort these questions out for themselves. Will the Minister comment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should get on and discuss the amendment in more detail. I hope that I will satisfy the hon. Member for Knowsley, North that our provision for paid leave for officers who wish to serve on local authorities is extremely reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. David Trippier)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are interested in the comments of the hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth) about Derek Hatton. We acknowledge with great respect the hon. Gentleman's part in the saga of Derek Hatton's reign as deputy leader of Liverpool and the difficulty that the local authority had dismissing him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my hon. Friend consider that, if these regulations had been law then, they would have so restricted Mr. Hatton in carrying out what were
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0592">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>315</span>
often evil works in Liverpool—I choose my words carefully—that he would have been forced either to give up, or to spend more time with Knowsley borough council? I am not certain whether the hon. Member for Knowsley, North would have welcomed that consequence, which would have been a mixed blessing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes his own point very successfully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those of us who had to deal with Liverpool and the gentleman who has been referred to do not need lectures on how to cope from Conservative Members. Some of us spent hours sweating over a solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister endorse the suggestion of her colleague, the Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Mr. Trippier), that we should deal with people whose views we do not share and whose activities we do not countenance by stopping them taking part in legitimate local government activity rather than by sorting out the problem? That seems to be the implication of his remarks about restricting people's ability to serve on a council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle could be applied to any councillor. If we make employment conditions so hard and restrictive that an officer cannot spend any time being a councillor he will be unable to be a councillor. The logic of the hon. Lady's argument is that we should do away with councillors because they will not be able to do their job, and that we should have only officers directed by the Department of the Environment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that there has been a misunderstanding about the provision for paid leave. A limit of 26 days' paid leave is a generous and fair agreement. Our debate highlights how far removed Opposition Members are from the culture of the private sector. The fact that they regard five weeks' paid leave in addition to normal leave as derisory makes my argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be emphasised that five weeks is more than the allowance in the Civil Service, which grants only 18 days. There is nothing to stop councillors taking more than 26 days as unpaid leave if they wish. However, I imagine that a local authority that organises greatly needed services recognises that its employees have a responsible and onerous job and acknowledges their important contribution as councillors. The hon. Member for Knowsley, North referred to his time as vice-chairman of the highways committee of Huyton urban district council. I have every respect for his work. I am sure that the Tufty club benefited greatly and that road safety in the area improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing people who are employed to undertake different tasks. I strongly believe that those responsibilities are equally serious, unless local authorities wish to be open to the accusation of creating sinecures for political activists in neighbouring authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>316</span>
The amendments would remove the statutory limit on paid leave for local authority employees to carry out duties as council members. It would relax the existing criteria in section 29 of the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 and frustrate the purposes of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Widdicome committee found that some local authorities had been giving excessive paid time off to employees who were councillors on other authorities. Some gave virtually full-time paid leave of absence. The committee acknowledged that this provision had sometimes been influenced by unsatisfactory remuneration for councillors. The committee did not, however, consider that it was a proper use of public funds to provide an indirect subsidy for councillors in this way and proposed a statutory upper limit of 26 days' paid leave a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the White Paper, the Government accepted the arguments for the limit. It will remain possible for councils to grant longer periods of unpaid leave. It is interesting to note that the Widdicombe committee said the proposed 26-day limit, while providing a proper safeguard, was more than some authorities currently granted and should not be regarded as the nom. We consider that 26 days' paid leave is a reasonable limit and that there is no case for increasing it. The White Paper acknowledged the demands made on chairmen, or their equivalent, of principal councils and the limit will not apply to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is designed to curb the excesses of paid leave exemplified by the sort of cases that we have discussed. It imposes the limitations which we consider necessary in addition to those of the 1978 Act. The amendment, however, takes the 1978 Act criteria as a starting point and suggests that an authority would have to take into account what is
	<br><blockquote><p>"reasonable in all the circumstances"</p></blockquote>
having regard to the time off considered necessary for the performance of councillors' duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice the amendment would give authorities carte blanche to continue granting as much paid time off as they thought appropriate, and enable them to perpetuate exactly the kind of abuse that the Bill is designed to curb. No doubt some Opposition Members would not be averse to that consequence, but we cannot support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has probably been some uncertainty about amendments Nos. 117 to 119, to which the hon. Member for Truro spoke. Metropolitan districts are covered by the word "district", as are shire districts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 117 and 118 apply the limit of 208 hours, which I emphasise is more than five weeks, time off for membership of metropolitan district councils, shire district councils, parish councils, community councils in Wales, Scottish district councils and Scottish islands councils. Amendment No. 119 sets a new limit of 416 hours, which is quite a bit more than 10 weeks time off for membership of county councils, London borough councils and Scottish regional councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps on reflection the hon. Member for Truro will agree that the amendments show some mixed thinking. Less time off would be given for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0593">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>317</span>
membership of Liverpool city council than for Lambeth borough council. Perhaps the SLD has given up the idea of winning Liverpool again and the proposal is designed to help its members consolidate their position in Tower Hamlets. Being in a London borough, they would receive additional time off. Indeed, with five or seven chief executives that might be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps of more interest to the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) is the fact that there would be less time off for membership of a Scottish islands council than of a Scottish regional council, even though islands councils carry out all the functions of regional and district councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 26-day limit for paid leave is appropriate. We do not wish to encourage abuse. The Bill's provision is important and I urge the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's response is unsatisfactory. I freely admitted that our definitions were not necessarily right. They simply turned round some of the Bill's definitions to generate a debate on the different pressures on different councillors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pressure on councillors who operate, say, a budget of £600 million is quite different from that on those who operate a budget of £4 million. That must be so. The practice of councils throughout the country demonstrates that more time is needed than the hon. Lady suggests. The hon. Lady might argue that Opposition Members simply do not recognise the pressures of the private sector, but surely the public sector should take the lead in showing the value that we place on such community involvement. The provision affects councillors from all parties, so the hon. Lady's comments on councils in which my party and others are involved were disgraceful and simply irrelevant. They were just as disgraceful as taking one or two examples of abuse which, incidentally, have now been tackled as the basis for legislating for all. That is not right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That said, the amendments as drafted are not perfect. I do not claim that the number of hours proposed is necessarily right. I should certainly like to return to the matter. I hope that the amendments will not be pressed further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not press our amendments to a Division, but I am disappointed with the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has it dawned on the hon. Gentleman that most local authority employees whom the provisions will affect are teachers and lecturers? They already have fairly lengthy holidays and it is proposed to give them 26 days' paid leave as well. That is more than the Civil Service gets and more than most of the private sector can manage. It is difficult to understand how the hon. Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column'>318</span>
could regard that as anything other than extremely reasonable and fair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to stray into that area of discussion. The difficulty is not about whether teachers take enough time off or about how much holiday they get. The difficulty applies to the local education authority that employs them. Does the hon. Lady accept that it might not be possible for someone—whether or not a teacher—to be the leader of a council with only 26 days' paid leave a year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some meetings take place in the evenings—they do not have to take place in the day. Indeed, when deciding when to hold their meetings, councillors should consider convenience so as to attract people with a wide range of experience. We need committed councillors from a cross-section of backgrounds who are prepared and able to take on onerous responsibilities to meet the needs of their local communities. Local authorities should not merely be part-time resting grounds for local authority employees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked that question because I was a further education lecturer and, at the same time, an elected councillor. I got out of that. It was not because the holidays were not wonderful—they were almost as good as the ones I now get—and it was not because I was ill-fitted to the occupation. I took young people who were studying O-level and A-level subjects with examinations at the end of their courses and it was difficult for me to organise my time and theirs so that my absence could be satisfactorily covered. Only through a proper system arranged through negotiation could my absences be covered. If a cross-section of people in local government includes teachers and lecturers, we must ensure that their hours of absence are covered by equally well qualified people. If not, students and schoolchildren will suffer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was a school teacher while the leader of the opposition was on a London borough and a member of the Inner London education authority. The ILEA met during the day. My authority—Kent county council—allowed me nine days off a year. By judicious use of those nine days—by dividing them into half days—I fulfilled my function as a member of the ILEA on the schools committee and the development sub-committee in different years, and on the education committee, and as the leader of the opposition on a London borough, which had its meetings in the evenings. I did that by using nine days. The hon. Gentleman's argument does not get over that fact. If the hon. Gentleman proposes our allowing more than 26 days, he will simply exacerbate the problem, of, for instance, the further education lecturer, who must juggle his teaching timetable. As a senior member of staff, I used to arrange my timetable so that I was regularly free.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I used my free periods to attend ILEA meetings. My classes did not have to be covered
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0594">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>319</span>
because I arranged my timetable accordingly. I could do that with nine days a year. It is absurd for the hon. Gentleman to argue that 26 days a year are not enough. His proposals would make the problem even worse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a long intervention. Obviously, the hon. Gentleman was not listening to what I said. I did not say that 26 days was reasonable or unreasonable. The amendment proposes, in effect, precisely what the hon. Gentleman managed to do—that people should be able to make local arrangements that suit their circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman admitted using his seniority, such as it was, to arrange his timetable, with the co-operation of Kent county council, to enable him to carry out his duties on the ILEA and the London borough on which he was leader of the opposition. With the best will in the world, I cannot envisage the role of an opposition leader in a London borough being especially time-consuming. Nevertheless, I respect the hon. Gentleman for having fulfilled that role. There should be flexibility at local level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely accept that it may be possible for a person to arrange things so that he or she does not need 26 days a year, but that is not the point. There could be sensible arrangements at local level to meet everyone's needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to delay the debate unnecessarily, but one of the problems that have been pinpointed by the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) is that we do not know whether it would have been less damaging to the children to have given him time of for council duties, or less damaging to the ratepayers to have given him time off to stay at the school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's knowledge of the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) is increasing at an alarming rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant) described my action as disgraceful, and the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) attacked me. What I did was moral. I arranged that my non-teaching periods, to which I was entitled, were on the days when I needed to be at the ILEA. I did not take any time off from the classes that I wanted to teach. The hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth) will be interested to know that I achieved the best exam success rate in my department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly the work that was done with students created a useful result. However, I do not wish to discuss the actions or otherwise of the hon. Member for Pembroke—he regales us often enough with his background, without my enabling him to detain us further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not proposing that people should have more than 26 days' leave a year; simply that such arrangements should be resolved at local level. Before
	<span class='label label-info column'>320</span>
I was sidetracked, I was about to say how disappointed I was in the Minister's reply. The hon. Lady has fallen into the same trap as the Minister for Local Government. She used exceptional cases to support her argument—I do not know whether they were abuses—for provisions that will become the generality in local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are asking the Committee to consider the hundreds of thousands of people involved in public duties who behave in a most exemplary manner. It is clear that the hon. Lady has been corrupted in her brief time as a member of the Government, and prefers not to accept our modest, reasonable amendment. I shall not press it to a Division, as it is clear that we would not win. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 100, in page 15, line 10, leave out "1989" and insert "1990".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will be pleased to know that I shall be as brief as possible. It is apparent that, since the Minister for Local Government left the Committee Room, tempers seem to have cooled down a great deal. There is something to be said for the way in which the hon. Lady has presented her case. The amendment would exclude the financial year 1989–90 from the restrictions placed on time off, so that the new system would start no earlier than 1 April 1990.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to ascertain a timetable for the Bill, especially in view of the anxieties expressed by councillors who may wish to seek re-election in 1990. The Bill is extremely unfair, and amendments are needed to excuse those councillors from its provisions. The clause hangs a sword of Damocles over the heads of elected councillors, who can hardly be expected to plan their municipal year on the basis of a Bill that is not likely to become statute by 1 April 1989.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill contains 144 clauses and numerous schedules. New clauses will be added by the Government and a tremendous number of amendments have been tabled. The Bill will go to the other place—Lord knows what will happen there—and it will come back to this House before it receives Royal Assent. Even by 1 April 1990 it probably will not be on the statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the clause, councillors who have time off arrangements in the year up to 1 April 1990 could be penalised. This is retrospective legislation and it is unfair to incumbents. The Government have said that parts IV and V at least are intended to be in force by 1 April 1990. In the interests of equity and fair play, revised legislation should affect only those councillors who come into office after that date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why are the Government so worried that they consider it necessary to bring in these leave and time off arrangements a year early? Are they working to have the Bill enacted in good time to make the transitional arrangements irrelevant, or are they trying to affect the outcome of the London elections in 1990? The Bill would be a way of doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0595">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>321</span>
If the Bill becomes law before 1 April 1990, the clause will create problems. If the Bill becomes law after 1 April 1990, the clause will be irrelevant. The Government should not be unfair to councillors who are currently in post. We want the Government to reconsider the clause, as it imposes restrictions on serving councillors that conflict with earlier clauses, such as clause 1(7) and (8). We want the Minister to tell us why the Government want the provision enacted now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant) said that the Bill would probably not be on the statute book by April 1990. If that were fact rather than hypothesis, I would be an extremely worried man, but we anticipated that the hon. Gentleman would fly that kite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We studied the clause carefully, as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment said in her reply to an earlier group of amendments, and we cannot see what all the fuss is about. I understand that the hon. Gentleman is trying to soften the blow on those who are already serving on local authorities, but I do not think that too much sympathy should be extended to them. I take the line adopted by my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett), who made a superb intervention in the speech of the hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would have been very easy for me when I was the leader of the local authority in Rochdale to have complied with the new rules and regulations that are enshrined in the Bill. We organised matters so that we had evening meetings, which was the norm in the palmy days to which the hon. Member for Knowsley, North referred. While he was speaking I became very nostalgic for that period, which I miss greatly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand what the fuss is about. As the hon. Gentleman expects, I recommend that the committee reject his amendment. I do not understand how there could be any difficulty for those who serve on local authorities and work for other local authorities in adjusting their affairs to comply with the provisions. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State said in reply to the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) that the public sector was already setting an example in terms of the rules and regulations on the amount of time that civil servants have off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful that the hon. Member for Tottenham reduced his comments and made a short contribution. Mine will be equally short. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not answered some of my questions. I wanted him to tell us why his official are saying that parts IV and V of the Bill will be implemented on 1 April 1990 when the provision that we are discussing will be implemented before that. Why will the position not be uniform by implementing all parts of the Bill at the same time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that the Bill was published some time ago. We gave adequate notice, prior to discussion in the Committee, to those who will be affected. We believe that sufficient time—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>322</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a threat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not a threat. We have given ample opportunity and time to those who are serving as councillors to inform their employers in other authorities of the new arrangements to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clock will start on 1 April for the year 1989–90 and, for the part of the year after the clause comes into force, councillors will be able to have paid leave only if they have not used up their allowance of 208 hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has hit the nail on the head. When the Bill comes into force, if only a few hours of that allowance are left, the councillor will be allowed only those few hours. That is unfair because the councillor may have made contractual arrangements with his employer which do not take account of that time limit. It is unfair suddenly to spring the matter on him depending on whether the Bill—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to disagree with the hon. Gentleman. It is not unfair. It would be unfair if it were sprung on councillors. Since publication of the Bill, people's awareness of this provision has increased, and there has been ample time for new arrangements to be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the Minister realises how local government works. It cannot work on the basis of something that may happen. The Bill is not law. If I were a local government councillor, how could I go to my employer and discuss time-off arrangements on the basis of some Bill that the House of Commons may enact at some future date? Arrangements must be made on the basis of firm and concrete law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. We are still discussing this measure in Committee and it has yet to be reported back to the House and to go through all its remaining stages. It is wrong for the Minister to treat it as though it were already in place. I hope that the Minister will admit that he regrets what he has just said, otherwise, we might as well pack up an go home. The Minister might prefer that, but it is not the way that the House should work or that the country expects it should work. He should not be making such a proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree 100 per cent. with the hon. Gentleman. I am shocked that the Minister has made such a remark, but I should not be surprised—it is in keeping with the way in which the Government treat local government. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 131, in page 15, line 13, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) Nothing in this section shall have effect to reduce the level of payment to any councillor (in respect of the performance of their duties) as compared with the financial year 1988–89.".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0596">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>323</span>
The amendment inserts a new subsection (4) in clause 10. It will reduce the confusion and hardship that would be faced by serving councillors if the Government insist that their proposed ceiling on time off should apply from 1 April 1989. Like amendment No. 100, the purpose of this amendment is to allow a transitional period for councillors who will be affected by the new system. The Bill is complex, and councils will have to get used to many new arrangements. There are, for example, discussions taking place between the Department of the Environment and local authority associations about the new system of members' allowances; there will eventually be legislation on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is only fair that councillors who are also local authority employees and who will not be well paid in any case—the Bill says that they will have to earn less than £13,500 per annum—should not lose out financially because they are also serving the community. The transitional period provided for in the amendment would give councillors the chance to get accustomed to the new system and to apportion the time that they spend on council duties as efficiently and effectively as they can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new system should come into operation on 1 April 1990, not 1 April 1989. Will the Minister explain, again, why he wants the earlier start date? When does he expect this part of the Bill to come into force?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I well understand the purpose of the amendment. With respect, I am not sure that the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant) has made the effect of the amendment clear to the Committee or that he understands it. I am prepaped to give him the benefit of the doubt. The effect of the amendment would be that if an employee had in the financial year 1988–89 received, for example, 100 days' paid leave from the council, the council would be able to allow him paid leave to the same level, in the financial year 1988–89 and thereafter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the argument is only an extension of that made by the hon. Gentleman on amendment No. 100. I am afraid that I shall again recommend that the Committee reject this amendment, not only for the reasons that I endeavoured to catalogue on the last group but for the simple reason that the amendment would not have the effect that the hon. Gentleman surmises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There would be no problem with paid time off for councillors who are employees of a local authority or of any employer, if the level of remuneration for councillors, or the reimbursement by the employer, were part of a fair and sensible system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this argument will be further exemplified in the debate on new clause 2. We have
	<span class='label label-info column'>324</span>
no clear understanding of the Government's intentions, or rather that understanding of their intentions makes them seem so restrictive that it will be virtually impossible for senior elected members of the council to do their jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no good saying to members that they should have evening meetings. That reflects the attitude of Conservative Members to two experiences: first, they dislike all their experience of London boroughs and, secondly, they do not understand district councils in the shire counties. Anyone who has tried to run a major city, or a widespread county, with some accountability and without letting the officers do just what they like, could not suggest that time equivalent to half a day a week is sufficient for leading elected members. It may be enough for those back benchers who play limited, although valuable, roles on the council. It cannot be enough for those who understand how large cities work, or have taken seriously the Prime Minister's words about a return to the days of civic pride and those whom she eulogises sometimes or disparages sometimes—Chamberlain and other local government figures from the 19th century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking of big business. Conservative Members, Aims of Industry and the Centre for Policy Studies often tell us that local government is big business, yet the Government treat it as though it were not. Conservative Members must give serious consideration to the probable effect of the regulations. If the Bill goes through as they wish, and the remuneration and reimbursement problems are not sorted out, some council members will not be able to fulfil their duties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman and I appreciate his experience in these matters. Behind his remarks, there is a supposition that as a result of the allowances—which were largely introduced in 1973–74, during the reorganisation of local government—local government has improved. I accept that the hon. Gentleman believes that that is so, but I suggest that many people—particularly on the Government Benches—would say that as a result of that change, local government has deteriorated and that the more time in the day that a councillor spends in the town hall rather than at his other employment, the greater the temptation to run the administrative and managerial functions of the local authority. The hon. Gentleman may see that as a good thing; I do not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that it is a good thing, per se. I am not irrational enough to pretend that increased time spent by councillors in the town or county hall, or in the company of officers, automatically means improvement in service. The Labour party certainly does not accept responsibility for the local government reorganisation in 1973 and the consequent cumulative cut in grant of £22 billion, and the difficulties that face councillors with the transfer of services in London, reductions in spending and a plethora of legislation, such as compulsory competitive tendering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the local government legislation that the Government have implemented causes difficulties
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0597">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>325</span>
for councillors, because, without the decision of committees, officers are unable to act. The Minister cannot just say, "Let them get on with it managerially." Councillors have to make approvals, to serve on national bodies and meet Ministers. I have never yet known a Minister who said that it was acceptable to meet at 8 pm, so that the councillor could leave work at 4.30 and get to London in the evening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that precise point, the hon. Gentleman may carry some members of the Committee with him, including me. As just one Minister, I find it interesting that most of the delegations that we receive are so designed that people can come down here, have lunch and an enjoyable day out. I am not personally against that, but what is happening is so transparent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not rise to take that bait. My experience was different. Many of us wanted to return to our jobs, and did not want to waste the limited amount of time that we could spend with our children. Those of us who have spent seven days a week in the town hall with officers on Saturdays and Sundays trying to do the job do not simply believe that the Bill is vindictive and unnecessary. It is grossly misguided in terms of the genuine job that is done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the present director general of the Confederation of British Industry was the controller of the Audit Commission for Local Authorities in England and Wales, he described Sheffield authority as a "shining example". We had a good officer-member relationship, and used to spend 12 to 14 hours a day on council work. We did not leave at 6 o'clock in the evening; we wanted to get the job done. It was a difficult job, and the Bill will make it more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To relate an anecdote, when I chaired the planning services committee of Sheffield social services, I had only four hours off a week. It virtually killed me, but that was how I did the job. I did what I could in the evenings and at weekends. When I became leader of the council, it was apparent that it was not possible for me to continue working on that basis. Should it continue to be difficult for councillors to have legitimate time off, the associations on which civil servants rely for information and contact will start to fall apart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People will not be able to meet Ministers; they will retrench and deal solely with day-to-day, hand-to-mouth material. That might exclude people such as Derek Hatton and prevent them from carrying out their activities, but it will also exclude legitimate activity across county, city, borough and district authorities. Council members have the option of not having a job and receiving income support. That is a bad thing. People should have jobs and be able to attend a council as much as they can and benefit from the experience. The only alternative to that system would be a reduction in the number of salaried councillors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A system under which employers receive direct reimbursement would be sensible. When I was
	<span class='label label-info column'>326</span>
employed by a local authority, I would not have been excluded under the Bill. Had I been excluded, it would have had a detrimental effect, as I was already losing a considerable amount of pay. I recommend the system to Ministers, even though I did lose. I had to reimburse to the authority all the allowances to which I was entitled. I lost massively on pension rights, and if the Minister studies the pension arrangements, he will find that that is true. I also lost promotion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, activities will not cease. They will be transferred to those people who are so committed and enthused about the work that, whatever it does to their families and employment prospects, they will go on income support to do the job. They may not be the people whom Conservative Members or I would want. They may be the zealots—the retired can be zealots, too—or those people who cadnnot get a job. It is difficult for unemployed councillors to obtain employment; in fact, it is almost impossible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer my hon. Friend to a point that he made earlier about decisions that must be taken and the need for senior councillors, especially, to receive adequate time off. The Minister may not be aware that, under council standing orders, decisions over and above a certain financial limit cannot be taken by officers. They must be taken by elected members, leaders of the councils and so on. Because goods and services are so expensive nowadays, much of councillors' time is taken in making financial decisions that officers cannot take. That is a major part of their duties. To take such decisions, the details have to be considered. People have to leave work to go to the civic centre because papers cannot be signed without knowing the details. That takes a lot of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are some good private employers. Some people can release themselves, as have some Conservative Members today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sometimes poked a little for doing what I believe will help my party win the general election rather than merely opposing legislation that we do not like. One Conservative Member at least is attending a board meeting. That is fine. There is no difficulty if people can release themselves or be involved at a level where there is no problem about having time off. They get the results that they deserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The leader of the opposition on Sheffield council was an extremely good and diligent member whom I likes a lot. He was in great difficulty and could not attend the second interview for the city treasurer's job. We could have asked the prospective treasurers to attend an interview on Saturday afternoon, but that was not the usual practice. We expected people to come during the week for preliminary interviews and to attend officer working groups to be looked over and to go through a rigorous decision-making process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the end, we asked the applicants to attend on a Sunday but the decision was taken on a Monday and the leader of the opposition could not make it. That was regrettable because we had arranged the time especially so that he could be present. Such matters

Gentleman will explain why, when the Greater London council was under Conservative rule, it had half as many committees as it did under Labour rule, and why Conservative London boroughs get through their business, have fewer committees and a more effective service than those authorities with mountains of committees and meetings. Local government meetings are getting out of hand. That is not unconnected with the introduction of attendance allowances in 1974. Members who attend meetings all the time earn much more money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman actually said is that elected government is getting out of hand and that we should leave matters to managers and not to elected members. The attendance allowance was £10 and it is now only £17 to £20. If it had been increased in line with inflation, it would have been double what it is today, but it has been held down. It is scandalous for the hon. Gentleman to suggest that people are making money out of an attendance allowance that can be claimed only once in a 24-hour period. No one could possibly make money out of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain why the vice-chairman of Lambeth borough council was able to claim £29,000 in two years? That is £14,500 a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That example has been used more than once in the House. I have no evidence that that member claimed anything of the sort. Whatever was claimed, it was not an attendance allowance or subsistence money but an arrangement made by Lambeth borough for child care. If the Government want to legislate on that, please let them do so, but they must not, use the attendance allowance as an example of a way in which people make money. Many in local government lose money hand over fist in order to be involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have done a quick head count and, as far as I am aware, my hon. Friends the Members for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) and for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) and I were elected councillors prior to 1974 when attendance allowances were introduced. On that basis, we take grave offence at the remarks made by the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett). We are fairly representative of members of our party who are elected to a council. We do that job because we are interested and care about what we are doing, not because of a paltry attendance allowance which is neither here nor there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek only to ensure that members who are employed do not suffer such a gross loss that they can no longer continue to be elected members. My authority did not claim special responsibility allowances because we believed that the system was divisive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>328</span>
People will have to claim whatever allowances are available in the future. I put that on the record to show the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) that many people could have claimed. I could have claimed £4,500 a year without scrutiny and without losing anything but I—and my colleagues—did not choose to do so. It is disgraceful that the hon. Gentleman should make such allegations about elected members when people have lost a lot of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Evidence given to the Widdicombe inquiry showed that the average of 70 hours a month reflected the different activities undertaken by people, ranging from those who came in for one meeting a week to leaders, deputy leaders and chairmen or women of committees who had major responsibilities and were spending hundreds of millions of pounds. Their officers were glad that they were able to be there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There could be more meetings lasting until after midnight. That seems to be an obsession in the House. People suffering from chronic insomnia believe that they are not working hard unless they stay up until the middle of the night and are bleary-eyed in the morning. If that is what is wanted in local government, there will be a financial cost. That may be OK in London boroughs and small districts, but try running major cities in the evenings, at night or at weekends—it will cost the authorities a fortune in officer time, in keeping facilities open and in trying to service them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local government should not be run on the basis of prejudice dreamt up by people whose experience is gathered mainly by reading the 	<i>Evening Standard</i> or the 	<i>Daily Mail.</i> That is the tragedy of these proposals. It is at the root of whether there will be effective local government, with policies drawn up by members who are well informed and briefed by officers who have read the material and made informed decisions, or whether there will be bungling amateurism in which the running of city, borough and county government degenerates into a shambles which officers, who have no accountability to the electorate, will be left to sort out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers must say now whether it is feasible in a major city such as Bradford for the lord mayor—a non-political office—to undertake his duties if he is employed by another authority for half a day a week. Is the Minister saying that, irrespective of what people think, they are exempt, even if they are chairmen or lord mayors? Are they exempt if they are elected members who attend committees and run services, as chairmen of county councils or lord mayors are entitled to do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the case. Chairmen of councils are exempt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful. An interesting hole has been revealed. If the leader of the council is made lord mayor or chairman of the county, he can be released to do his duty, which is effectively what is done in the United States or in the mayoral system in France. If the leader is not made lord mayor or chairman, he cannot be released.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are we to advise our members that to carry out their duties effectively, an American or French
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0599">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>329</span>
mayoral system should be instituted in the cities and boroughs and the equivalent for the designated chairmen in the counties? That is an interesting concept which I had not hit upon before but which I hope that we shall discuss tonight. When Ministers reply, I should like clarification because we would commend that proposal. It would involve a major constitutional change but has interesting possibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the context of local government, a major constitutional change is the suggestion that, unlike employees in other sectors, local authority employees should have almost unrestricted paid leave to act as councillors for other local authorities. Serving an authority as an employee or as an elected member is an honourable, important and worthwhile task. We seek to establish the distinction. The Bill's proposals are fair, even generous, and we believe that we have got the balance right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are many issues which, political vindictiveness apart, Conservative Members need to consider. As the Minister for Local Government is not here, I cannot ask him to take on board our reasonable, sensible and thought-through proposals in a warm but cordial atmosphere that will inspire Conservative Members to give as they would not do if our suggestions were made in another spirit. However, I am sure that the Under-Secretary is willing to take our ideas on board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends bitterly resent any suggestion that we are not deeply committed to local authorities, to the valuable work of councillors and to the general purpose of local government and its well-being.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not done the necessary research to be certain, but I dare say that the vast majority, if not all my hon. Friends, have given distinguished service to local authorities. For example, my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, South (Mr. Bright) was a district councillor for Thurrock and a county councillor for Essex. For 14 years he did all that work in his holiday leave. He took no other paid leave.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He could afford it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should listen more carefully. My hon. Friend used his normal paid leave for local authority purposes. He did not have special paid leave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Committee's attention to the recommendations of the Widdicombe report. Lest there be any confusion, I make it plain that I refer to the authorised, unanimous version of the final report, published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office as Cmnd. 9797, and not to any other document or minority report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph 6.120 of its report the independent committee, speaking unanimously—not the Government—says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Some local authorities have been giving excessive paid time-off to employees who are councillors on other authorities."</p></blockquote>
I do not wish to name specific instances, but we are all aware of examples where too much advantage has been taken of an employing local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>330</span>
The Widdicombe committee made it clear that the practice is not general and that some authorities impose limits on time off that are as strict as those in the Civil Service, although other authorities are lax. The report says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We do not believe, that this is a proper use of public funds to provide an indirect subsidy for councillors in this way."</p></blockquote>
The report said that it is reasonably common practice for large firms to grant about 18 days' paid leave a year, and so does the Civil Service. The committee recommended an upper limit on such paid leave of 26 days a year—one day a fortnight—and recognised that there were possibilities for the 18-day limit to be extended slightly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause refers to 208 hours rather than to 26 days because we consider that it is easier to reckon time off in hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this connection, I draw hon. Members' attention to another comment in the Widdicombe report. It expressed concern that
	<br><blockquote><p>"some committee chairmen have become increasingly involved in the managerial minutiae of service departments exercising more influence over committee agendas, the contents of reports, staff appointments, the letting of contracts and relations with the workforce."</p></blockquote>
It was the view of the Widdicombe committee that it was not desirable to have such over-involvement:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Councillors, while retaining overall legal responsibility for the delivery of services should seek to leave the day-to-day management of those services as far as possible to officers."</p></blockquote>
No one would dispute that some large city councils require a great deal of commitment. We believe that we have found a way through. The suggestion of 26 days is proper and appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) also made remarks that were much more relevant to the remuneration of councillors. A working group is looking at that in consultation with the local authority associations and it is the subject of new clause 2. I imagine that the hon. Gentleman and others will wish to take up the debate then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>VOTING RIGHTS OF MEMBERS OF CERTAIN COMMITTEES: ENGLAND AND WALES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 120, in page 15, line 26, at end insert "or
	<br><blockquote><p>"(d) is a magistrate appointed by virtue of office to a police committee or joint police committee for the purposes of the Police Act 1964.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 121, in page 16, leave out lines 8 to 10.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment includes in the list of committees where only elected representatives may vote the joint police committees set up under the Police Act 1964. In other words, it would remove the ex-officio voting rights of magistrates on those committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every argument that the Government put forward in favour of extending the measure to education committees applies to police committees. Usually there are only three or four teachers with voting rights on education committees. By contrast, on police committees, magistrates comprise one third of the membership. Accountability to local, democratically elected councillors is fundamental and should reflect the way in which local people vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly the Government believe that, otherwise they would not have every other committee listed in subsection (4). But they do not apply the provision to magistrates. The work of police committees should come under the accountable control of democratically elected councillors. If the Government do not accept that, they should put forward reforms to remove accountability altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, the present system is muddled. Basic accountability exists because county councillors are in a majority, but unelected magistrates are on the committee as well, so representativeness is distorted and may be entirely changed. The committee chairman who is elected may show that the committee does not reflect the general views of the council, and as a result the views of police committees may come into conflict with those of the elected authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Magistrates are not elected, so they are not accountable to the local electorate. They are not even accountable to other magistrates as they emerge—rather like Conservative party leaders used to emerge. Therefore, police committees are comparable to the other committees listed in the clause. I hope that the Minister will recognise that and not argue that teachers and magistrates have different views because they have different political outlooks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposals on co-option in the Bill are intended to strengthen local accountability and to establish that only elected members will be responsible for a council's executive actions and spending decisions. However, there are important and significant exceptions, such as committees that have special statutory arrangements. The police committees are precisely such an example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We resist the suggestion that magistrates on police committees should have their voting rights removed. Magistrates have been exempted from the restrictions on voting because police committees are constitutionally distinct from other local authority committees and there is a statutory requirement under the Police Act 1964 for one third of the members of police committees to be magistrates for the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>332</span>
Police committees do not discharge a function of the county council but are a separate statutory authority with separate statutory responsibilities in their own right. Indeed, where a police area covers more than one county, and in the metropolitan areas, the police authority is not a committee of a local authority but a body corporate in its own right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Magistrates on police committees are therefore not co-opted in the normal sense of the parent committee inviting them on—they are appointed according to a scheme made by the relevant magistrates' courts committees and approved by the Home Secretary. Magistrates are chosen for their close knowledge of police affairs and problems, and are full and equal members of the police authority. We would not wish to alter that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education committees are the subject of amendments Nos. 132 and 122 and the hon. Gentleman can pursue his argument about their relevance later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Committee to resist the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the Minister is giving way or sitting down. Either way, I will respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will not be sufficient simply to say that the comparison with education will be dealt with when we debate other amendments. I did not argue that we should change the position of teachers. We should change the position of magistrates, and maximise the teachers' position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Police committees are constitutionally quite distinct from other local authority committees. The statutory requirement in the Police Act 1964 preferred members of police committees to be magistrates for the area. We do not intend to alter those arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I dispute the principle rather than the technicalities, in that if the Minister accepts that police committees should be democratically accountable, I see no reason why magistrates should be voting members of the committees, but however, I see every reason why their expertise may be called upon, so I do not seek to restrain them. If they are democratically accountable their position should not be distorted by other members who have votes but were not elected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not attempted to meet that requirement. If she does not believe that there should be democratic accountability, why have county councillors as two-thirds of the membership? If she does believe that, why not ensure that the voting membership reflects the way in which people vote in elections?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The police committees are a special case that is strongly connected with magistrates' historical role. The hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) will explain that in Scotland magistrates have not traditionally played such an important part in keeping the peace. In England, magistrates were largely responsible for police committees. Police committees are joint bodies, which represent a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0601">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>333</span>
partnership between magistrates and local authorities. They are not committees of the county council in the same way as education authorities and others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify whether she thinks that police committees should be democratically accountable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have made it clear. They should, in part. They are a mix. Two-thirds of their representatives are county councillors and one-third magistrates. This recognises the important part that the latter play. The Government think that it is a satisfactory and proper arrangement that should continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The description of their accountability as "in part" is not accurate. A potential majority is given to a viewpoint different from the elected one. It is not that the electorate is partly able to call these committees to account. The majority may be wholly unable to do so because the majority on the committee does not reflect majority local opinion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am beginning to lose confidence that I will be able to convince the hon. Gentleman. In a sense, magistrates on police committees represent the national interest. They have a duty to keep the peace. They have to make up their mind to vote on the issues, as elected representatives on the committee do. Police committees are a special case. They are a partnership, and we think that the arrangement established for them in the Bill will serve the best interests of those who are concerned with the police and with the effective provision of law and order services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having listened to the Minister, I remain unconvinced. I am anxious to ensure that there is democratic representation, but, with the under-attendance in Committee, I am not sure that we would achieve that now.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my usual fashion I shall be brief. Will the Minister clarify one or two issues? We may be unanimous about not wanting the majority of non-elected members to be able to make a decision that would preclude a council from overturning it, but we would not be unanimous about trying to increase and develop democracy so that people can genuinely participate in it, as opposed to having decisions handed down from above.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to encourage, not preclude, participation in local forums and local committees that have been established following the decentralisation of services in every complexion of authority. We note that statements have been made on the issuing of—dare I say—derogations in terms of tenants committees, and committees responsible for the management of parks and estates and other places where facilities such as sports centres are managed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There, management decisions have to be taken by executive committees and councils, and financial decisions are subject to audit and accountability. Finance is crucial because responsibility is often delegated to various sub-committees or area committees which allow them to spend small amounts of money—a decision that is, sensibly, within their prerogative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want eveything to be decided at the lowest, not the highest level. Many decisions cannot be passed over to managers. Conservative Members agree that decisions have to be taken by elected members. This part of the Bill insists that they are taken by elected members, not co-opted members. One cannot have it both ways—one cannot say that those employed by local authorities who are not elected should be able but co-opted members should not be able, to make minor decisions about such matters as spending small amounts of money. Those matters are not the business of major committees or council. Councils have never had co-opted members, so the decision of authority is always taken by the council. The decision on what should not be decided by council rests with the council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not heard serious worries about this matter for many years, but there is no reason why there could not be a joint-party agreement on rules and codes of practice on what should be delegated. Serious political issues should not be delegated, but decided by major committees. However, minor geographic service-oriented decisions could be delegated. Committees will have to meet late at night and will have other matters on their plate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will Ministers decide under regulation, and how will local authority associations participate in decision making? Many organisations working with and for people with disabilities wish to widen the representation of views on appropriate committees. That is happening now—councils wish voluntary services and voluntary organisations to play a sensible role in participative and pluralistic
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0602">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>335</span>
democracy, which is not confined solely to the wisdom of elected members, but determined by the elected members in council or by the delegation given to committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are sensible matters. Whatever examples may have encouraged Ministers to dream up those matters, they cannot justify introducing such legislation. Controversial committees that have tried to tackle racism have tried to widen representation, especially in areas where minority ethnic groups have not traditionally been represented on councils. That is changing, and there is now participation in the process, but it takes time. People have been involved in a meaningful and constructive way, often with decisions being subject to ratification at council level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is "executive" in terms of the final decisions of Ministers? What is inapplicability of financial delegation, which was just mentioned by the Under-Secretary? It is important that these points are clarified, otherwise, the Government will be using a sledgehammer not to crack a nut but to crack the valuable extension of participative democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are about to discuss education committees and teachers, so I shall not touch on them. However, we need to know what will happen to social services, participation of under-represented groups, the genuine involvement of interested parties, area management, and the decentralisation of functions and decisions. Although magistrates on police committees and fisheries committees are statutory, that does not affect the rationality of their decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have no quarrel with the main thrust of the hon. Gentleman's arguments, and accept that much of what he says is sensible. Amendment No. 137 is unnecessary because the regulations cover what it proposes. Amendment No. 139 is also unnecessary if we are to consult local authority associations.

the same as Parliament being able to debate the matters properly which would also help us to know what we are approving. Part of the problem with the Bill is the number of decisions that Ministers will make by regulations under the parent Act. If Ministers are willing to examine how to relate executive and financial delegation to a sensible agreement with local authority associations, there will not be much of a problem, and I am wasting my time. I am a realist about these matters; I want to try to make progress because there are many organisations with which Ministers would also want to be in tune.

This is a probing amendment to make sure that as we move to the new regime of clauses 11 and 12, the provisions of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 are not overlooked. That Act says that where people who are not members of the local authority are co-opted to serve on local authority committees, they should include disabled people or people with experience of work among disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that the introductory notes, which refer to other local government legislation, and the Government's response to the Widdicombe report, contain no reference to the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act, which has an impact on co-option. Doubtless because of some of the abuse of the co-option rules at present, the section on co-option in the Government's response was slightly grudging. It said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the contribution of co-opted members to policy formulation can be valuable"</p></blockquote>
but did not recognise that the representation of the disabled on social services committees in particular has been invaluable in making sure that requirements such as access are not overlooked. I quite understand why we are clamping down on co-option and I agree that co-opted members should not have the vote. However, I just wanted a reassurance from my hon. Friend that members who are co-opted under the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act will still be welcome under the new regime, that their contribution has been valued and that there is no question of the Government going back on the principles behind section 15 of that Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) is basically on the right lines. It is his amendment and it is up to the Government to respond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>337</span>
I can reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) if I refer him back to the original Widdicombe report. Paragraph 5.92 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Co-option is a means by which local authorities can make use of outside expertise and experience which might not be available among elected members and officers."</p></blockquote>
While the plan to curb the powers of co-opted members to prevent misuse of co-options is an important part of the Bill, we do not intend to discourage co-option of disabled people who have a particularly important part to play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 15 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 requires local authorities to consider co-opting chronically sick and disabled persons, or those with experience of such people, to committees dealing with matters which may affect them. Amendment No. 79 provides that nothing in clause 11 shall prejudice any arrangements made for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing in clause 11 prevents local authorities from co-opting disabled people, or their representatives, to social services and other committees, and section 15 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act will continue to require local authorities to consider making such appointments to relevant committees. Clause 11 will restrict the voting rights of any such members if that committee is responsible for taking executive decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is in line with the main aim of clause 11, and of clause 12, which is to strengthen local accountability by ensuring that in general, only elected members are responsible for taking executive decisions. There is no question of preventing voluntary groups, disabled groups, or any other groups, or individuals from playing a full and active role in local government. Such persons will continue to be able to speak at, and advise, executive committees as non-voting members. They will also be able to serve and vote on any advisory committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I accept that some local authorities may wish to set up specific committees or sub-committees to manage a specific facility for the elderly or disabled, or some other group, and that in those circumstances, the users of such facilities should have some say in their running. That should give my hon. Friend further encouragement. It is why we have provided in clause 11(4)(g) for the Secretary of State to make regulations exempting certain types of committees from the restrictions on voting. We intend to use the powers to exempt committees responsible for the management of specific local facilities from these provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall be discussing the details of the exemptions with the local authority associations, but I hope that they will provide the scope for local authorities to give disabled people a full and active say in the running of day care facilities, residential homes and other similar valuable community projects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for the assurances that she has given and her warm appreciation of the role that is played by
	<span class='label label-info column'>338</span>

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed:</i> No. 105, in page 16, line 32, leave out "Schedule" and insert "Part".—[	<i>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley.</i>]</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment corrects a drafting error in clause 11(5). Paragraph (b) refers to paragraph 3 of "that Schedule"—meaning schedule 1 to the Education Act 1944. In fact, that schedule has several parts, each of which, unusually, has its own sequence of paragraph numbers. The reference should be to paragraph 3 of part II of schedule 1. The amendment therefore replaces the word "Schedule" in clause 11(5)(b) with the word "Part".

	<br><blockquote><p>"or who have in the opinion of the authority an interest in education within the area (but not exceeding four in number)".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With your permission, Sir Anthony, I shall stand in for my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), who is watering his dog. Perhaps his dog is watering him—I am not sure which way round it happens—but I know that there has been a slight problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This group of amendments deals with teachers, and amendment No. 142 draws attention to the Bill's effect on the constitution of education committees. It has far-reaching implications and raises a number of serious political and administration issues. Its aim is to preserve the voting rights of certain groups and organisations whose representation on education committees is—I emphasise this—required by law. It further draws attention to the implication of clause 11 for certain denominations and faiths, including the free churches and representatives of the Moslem, Hindu and Sikh religions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present law is governed by section 101 of the Local Government Act 1972, which required
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0604">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>339</span>
authorities to establish education committees in accordance with the provisions of part II of the first schedule to the Education Act 1944. Part II of that Act required education committees to be established including both local authority members, and
	<br><blockquote><p>"persons of experience in education and persons acquainted with the educational conditions prevailing in the area for which the committee acts".</p></blockquote>
I see that my hon. Friend has now watered his dog, but as I am partly through the brief, perhaps he will take his time, listen to me, and then take over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rationale for the policy was set out in education circular 8/73 in March 1973, of which I shall quote paragraph 12:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It has invariably been found in practice that this requirement (i.e. of outside co-option) can be satisfactorily met only by appointing to the Education Committee members from outside the Council and all arrangements submitted for approval should include provision for the appointment of a reasonable proportion of such members".</p></blockquote>
The circular went on to state that authorities should consider including in the category of people with experience,
	<br><blockquote><p>"particularly members nominated by the teaching profession and the churches."</p></blockquote>
The problems caused by clause 11 are illustrated by the amendments. The clause will end the voting rights of three specific categories. The first is teachers, whether primary, secondary or representing further education. The second is representatives of the free Churches, except when they could be considered to represent foundation governors of voluntary schools in the area of the relevant authority. That would mean that free Church representatives would lose their vote unless there was an interdenominational school, or a school in which they were heavily involved as providers, in the area of the local authority concerned. That would be the exception rather than the rule. The third category is representatives of any other faiths on education committees. The third category raises sensitive matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The following comments were made on those categories. On teachers, the Government have completely reversed the policy stated in the circular of 1973, which set out the following reasons for the proposed composition of education committees in paragraph 13(a).
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State considers that the professional expertise of serving teachers equips them well to make an effective contribution to the work of Education Committees, and therefore commends to the new authorities the practice of making specific provision in their Committee arrangements for the appointment of serving teachers as non-Council members".</p></blockquote>
The circular goes on to urge that teacher representatives should be selected from primary, secondary and further education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the Minister's reply to that? I want a clear answer. The then Secretary of State for Education who issued that circular was none other than the present Prime Minister. The Minister is in a difficult position and I can almost hear his knees knocking under the table. There is a drumming noise, which at first I thought was Offa the dog of my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside, who is wagging his tail
	<span class='label label-info column'>340</span>
with delight. I want to know whether the Minister will survive this evening or whether he will be called to No. 10 Downing street to be told that, as with most Ministers in the Department of the Environment, his career will be short-lived. Most survive for a year and some survive a little longer, but not much longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the free Churches, the 1973 circular suggested that "where appropriate" nominations should be sought from diocesan education committees in respect of the Church of England or the Church in Wales, from the diocesan bishop in respect of the Roman Catholic Church and
	<br><blockquote><p>"from the Local Free Church Federal Council or Federation in the case of the free churches".</p></blockquote>
On other faiths—this is very important—it is clear that the intention of clause 11 is to exclude any representatives of non-Christian faiths who may currently have voting rights on education committees. Perhaps the Government will justify that proposal. In two examples that I shall give, it will be far from clear that the proposal will contribute to the promotion of good race relations in the development of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State cannot disapprove of anything in the representations that local authorities have accorded to individuals or groups within the formula of the Education Act 1944. Local authorities are required to obtain the approval of the Secretary of State on the composition of the education committee within the formula that they consider appropriate to their area. Arrangements made until now have been with the approval of the Secretary of State. The Minister is now in trouble with both the Secretary of State for Education and the Prime Minister. The removal of voting rights from individual representatives will not be a matter of accident or local circumstance. The Department of Education and Science is aware of the basis of composition of all the education committees that have been established under this provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that I would give two examples. Rochdale metropolitan borough council has an education committee consisting of between 30 and 34 members, of whom a minimum of 21 are members of the council and a minimum of nine are co-optees within the terms of the 1944 Act formula. An additional one to four members may belong to either group, although, at present, only one person from that category is nominated to the committee. Of the nine co-optees, three are teachers, representing primary, secondary and further education, who are elected by the whole teaching body in the area. That is not always the case, but it is so in this example. Three are Church representatives—one from the Church of England, one from the Roman Catholic Church and one who is nominated by the Free Church Council. That third person may not be able to retain his vote on the education committee as that depends, in practice, on the existence of an inter-denominational school in the area. Three lay persons are appointed for their experience in education. The additional appointee is a representative of the Moslem faith, appointed jointly by community groups. That person will lose his voting rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second example is none other than Bradford council, which decided in 1973–74 not to nominate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0605">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>341</span>
Church representatives within the 1944 Act formula because to do so would require the nomination of representatives from the Moslem, Hindu and Sikh faiths, as well as the Christian faith, to achieve proper representation. It would have been difficult to achieve that, given the requirement that the majority on the education committee should be members of the authority. That is important. I think that the Minister understands—I always have to look at him to make sure that he is following me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5) gives the Secretary of State power to make arrangements or issue an order
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purpose of securing the representation on that committee"—</p></blockquote>
an education committee—
	<br><blockquote><p>"… of persons who appoint foundation governors of voluntary schools in the area".</p></blockquote>
It is not entirely clear whether that provision merely reinforces the 1944 Act or whether it amounts to a requirement that such representatives should be included when there are foundation schools in the area. If the latter is true, it is feared that considerable dissent might be caused among non-Christian faiths in Bradford if Christian denominational representatives with voting rights were added to the education committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful if the Minister clarified the position and told us whether the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Education and Science are right, or whether a junior Minister in the Department of the Environment is right. If the Minister thinks that he is right, I wonder how long he will remain in his job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is wrong for the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) to try to put a razor blade between me and my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. The length of tenure of my office is a decision above my pay grade, as the Americans would say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some sympathy with many of the hon. Gentleman's remarks. I think that it is pure coincidence that he used Rochdale council as an example as that has been fed to him by way of briefing. He will recall that about half an hour ago, I said that I had been the leader of that council and am aware of the number of co-opted members to the council. I remember that I had tremendous difficulty in finding suitable accommodation—a problem that we experienced in the Committee. The hon. Member for Rochdale (Sir Cyril Smith) continually broke chairs in the council chamber, as hon. Members can imagine. I can speak with great authority on the hon. Member for Rochdale who, despite our political differences, is a friend of mine and a first-class constituency Member of Parliament. I had the privilege of fighting him in the 1972 by-election, when I was not just beaten but metaphorically sat upon, which was a painful experience when we remember that the hon. Member weighs about 29 stone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have examined the question raised by the hon. Member for Hammersmith, especially in the light of the fact that the Widdicombe committee was unable to come to a firm conclusion on the issue. We accept
	<span class='label label-info column'>342</span>
that both teachers and Church representatives have a special role to play on education committees, and that is reflected in the Education Act 1944, which requires the inclusion of
	<br><blockquote><p>"persons of experience in education and persons acquainted with the educational conditions prevailing in the area."</p></blockquote>
We consider that the providers of voluntary schools—mostly, but not exclusively, the Churches—are in a special position. They have a historic role in the provision of education in this country, and continue to play a major role in the education system—nearly one third of maintained schools in England are voluntary schools. This is the important point. We believe that where Churches and other bodies are providing voluntary schools alongside the education authority—that would not apply in some of the examples that the hon. Gentleman fairly quoted relating to Bradford, and certainly not at present—they should be entitled to be represented as full voting members of the education committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we have concluded that education committees will be equally able to benefit from the advice and expertise of teachers and other education experts by appointing such persons as non-voting members. In that respect, teachers are in the same position as social workers in relation to social services committees, or housing officers in relation to housing committees. Education committees will not be denied expert advice by the restrictions on voting, but they will become more democratically accountable for decisions that in future will be made generally by elected members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore urge the Committee to resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to the Minister, but I am not entirely convinced. As he will see from amendment No. 122, I shared some of the Labour party's worries about the provision. In spite of what the Minister said, the free Churches and others will regard is as anomalous. In an area where Methodists and others have traditionally been strong—the Minister knows about Rochdale—and other non-Christian communities—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that there is a difference of opinion between us on the matter, but is the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would rather not. The problem is that the established Church and the Catholic Church are given distinctive positions. We are now going into a history of the faith. People will understand the Minister's problem and try to respond to it, but I share the anxieties that have been expressed. I hope that by loosening the ties, it might be possible to reach a more effective accommodation with different views that will be expressed more strongly outside

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We could have resolved the problem if it were accepted that no vote would be binding unless it were referred back to council. I know of few examples where there has been trouble. I hope that the Government are not legislating because of what happened in Buckinghamshire when there were cuts in library facilities and school meals. It would be unfortunate if one incident coloured the Government's judgment. I have not heard an explanation of why then was then and now is now, as Lord Jenkins said in July 1984 about grant-related expenditure and rate capping. The position has not changed and I should have thought that the Government were happy with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister clarify whether providers of education in the denominational sector will have voting rights while those who are co-opted will not? That would be unfortunate, because many of us do not want to encourage particular faiths to set up separate schooling. We should like them to take part in the present system. Nothing should be done to encourage people to feel that, by setting up separate religious schooling, they are entitled to rights that otherwise they would not be given. I have yet to hear a logical reason as to why the system should be changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Compacts are also being developed—they were mentioned today in the statement on inner cities. The compilation of present policies has been issued, again today. Many local authorities have co-opted, with voting rights, those active in industry and commerce, as well as teachers, and it is unfortunate that those sensible arrangements are being upset.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
