	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter Clegg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May on behalf of my colleagues and myself, welcome you to the Committee, Mrs. Jeger, and hope that you will be struck by its action and attention to detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we were interrupted at one o'clock I was discussing these two amendments to Clause 27 which, as I said in quoting from the explanatory document, is one of the key clauses to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause substitutes current use value for the previous market value of other enactments. These amendments will have the effect of leaving intact the market value arrangement of other legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very difficult to assess this clause because we know what are the legal exemptions so far as current use value is concerned which we have in Clause 3. But in valuing land, if it is to be taken over by the State, there are certain other permitted matters to be taken into account, not enshrined in the Bill, which will be from time to time covered by the flexible extra-statutory instruments of the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause as it stands causes much concern. We have already seen how charities have reacted to it, but this afternoon I am concerned about the ordinary man in in the street who also suffers under this clause. If the charities suffer, then others will suffer. What they are having to do is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2106</span>
to sell their properties to the State at current use value plus the other elements that are not very easy to determine. Then they have to purchase back from the State at market value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told in other parts of the Bill that local authorities disposing of land must get the best price for it. What then is the position of someone in an area of future development who has to sell his property at current use value, and who after the second appointed day will get nothing other than that, apart from the other matters which I have mentioned? If he is a businessman he has to rehouse and re-establish himself in another development area and pay the full market value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know overall what these figures are going to mean because the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum to the Bill says that at this stage, which is the final stage of the Bill, the acquisition of land is going to cost the authorities something between £300 million and £400 million a year, and the estimated value of disposals on the other hand is going to be some £800 million to £900 million annually.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is obvious that the State is going to make a profit, and that is what the whole Bill is based on. Some people are going to suffer because they will have to sell at one price and buy at another, rehouse themselves and re-establish businesses. We do not, and never have, believed that this is fair. I certainly do not. We have in the past argued that if there is to be a fund raised by this method, those who suffer from the acts of the State should be compensated before the State itself takes any profit. In the main, I am referring to those whose business properties are to be sold at one price and need to be replaced at another price. It is not surprising that one receives many letters on this point, not only from charities but from a wide range of people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for North Fylde (Mr. Clegg) in this amendment, more perhaps from the agricultural standpoint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is strongly contested by the National Farmers Union because it does not take into account the need in assessing compensation for farmland that is taken for building or the need for what is sometimes described as comparability. To a certain extent, this is taken into account in the new towns valuation for land which is taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V008P0I1064">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2107</span>
Under this clause it will essentially be existing use value with no hope element in that value and, therefore, the farmer who is dispossessed will be unable to set himself up in business. It will also cut right across the existing compensation law in the Acts of 1961 and 1973. There is still considerable uncertainty about the owner's entitlement to compensation for the loss of his land and the consequential losses he suffers thereby. We contend that the clause increases the confusion and, if implemented, will mean that there will be many more claims on the hardship fund than might otherwise be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause takes no account of the market value that a dispossessed owner or occupier would have to pay for alternative land. It makes no provision for loss of amenity and, if implemented, would have a serious lowering effect on the valuation of claims for disturbance, for injurious affection and severance under the existing compensation Acts. As such, it will gravely affect the capital formation in agriculture, particularly in those areas close to areas of development, and will give rise to sterilisation of those parts of land which might be included as relevant development under the Bill. I hope this aspect can be considered in the light of the two amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Gordon Oakes)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to both the hon. Gentlemen. The hon. Member for North Fylde (Mr. Clegg) was right when he said that I would be resisting the amendments, which are quite fundamental to the conception of "after the second appointed day". The intention of the amendments is to provide that the change in the basis of compensation for compulsory purchase to current use value under this clause shall only apply to compulsory acquisitions under the new acquisition powers in Part III of the Bill and not to acquisitions made under other powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new acquisition powers in the Bill are complementary—I stress this—to the existing powers of local authorities, and it is envisaged that after the second appointed day there will still be acquisitions by local authorities for their own statutory purposes under the powers they have now as well as under the powers in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be absurd to have two separate and different codes of compensation in those circumstances. It would be absurd for a local authority to pay one price for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2108</span>
one type of acquisition and a totally different price—a market value price—for an acquisition for its own statutory purposes. That is why the words "whether under this or any other enactment" are included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the surface effect of the amendment, but much deeper there seems to be a fundamental misconception in the minds of the Opposition as to the ultimate move to current use value. This is our major objection to the amendment. The whole aim of the scheme is to arrive at a situation in which all land changes hands at current use value, except when an authority sells and recoups development value for the community by receiving full market value from the purchaser.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be envisaged that after the second appointed day one is in a current use value world. In that situation, when private purchasers will be paying current use value, it would be absurd if local authorities, when using powers other than those in the Bill, had to pay full market value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the businessman. That is analagous. But a better example was given by the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) who quoted the farmer and the representations from the National Farmers' Union about their opposition to this Bill. This again is based upon a fundamental misconception. It is true that the farmer would sell his farm at current use value. But he would buy his next farm at current use value, and that would be the division. That would be the last thing that the farmer would want to do, unless he wanted to buy developmentl and—an unusual position in which to be. If his land was acquired for development, he would not consciously seek out other development land for farming purposes. He would, however, buy that land at current use value. Thus after the second appointed day he would be no worse off. He would not be in the position, as both hon. Gentlemen said, of having to sell cheap and buy dear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the farmer lost his farm for development through compulsory acquisition by the local authority, not only could he buy another farm at current use value, but he would be entitled under the Land Compensation Act 1973 to farm loss payment or whatever other benefits accrue from that Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V008P0I1065">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2109</span>
I wish to make it perfectly clear about what the move to current use value is after the second appointed day. We will then be living in a world of current use value. The effect of this clause would be to penalise a local authority for using its continuing, existing powers to acquire land for its own statutory use, whether for housing estates, schools, old people's homes and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under this amendment, if the local authority were to acquire land for those purposes, it would have to pay a totally different and much higher price than anybody else. Neither side of the Committee would want that situation. I emphasise at the outset that the concept of current use value in the way we envisage it does not mean that a person sells cheap and buys dear. He would sell cheap and he would buy cheap, unless he deliberately opted to buy development land. That is the real position under this Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How will the Minister ensure that a person buys cheap? Will he put a ceiling on the sale price of property?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I, even having said that, withdraw it? I was trying to draw an analogy between cheap and dear; let me say between selling cheap and buying dear, which was the implication that hon. Gentlemen were making. He will sell at current use value; he will buy at current use value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does one ensure that he buys at current use value? If that is so, what is all this in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum to the Bill about the great profits which will be made by the sale of land taken over by the local authorities under the Bill? How does an owner-occupier—whether of a dwelling house, a small business or a farm—rehouse himself or re-set himself up in business? He will not be able to buy at current use value from the local authority. If he can buy from the local authority at current use value, what is the purpose of the Bill? There will be no profit to the local authority or to the central Government out of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that gradually in future, standards of living will be reduced. One sells a house at a certain figure, which is the current use value; one cannot possibly
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2110</span>
buy the same type of house, with the same accommodation, except at a much higher figure. I think the Minister is living in a sort of dreamland when he thinks that any owner of property will sell at current use value, unless he puts a restriction to this effect in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that this power is complementary to other powers of compulsory purchase and that, therefore, for all compulsory purchase this rule of compensation must apply. Let us disregard altogether the acquisitions under the Bill and look, for example, at a compulsory purchase order for a road which has to take into account some dwellings. Unfortunately, the owner of a dwelling which is taken over in that way will get under the Bill, not market value as he does now, but current use value. Then the local authority may find that that house is not needed for the road. After a public inquiry, the site for the road is moved a little and that house is not needed. Will the local authority sell that house at current use value? If so, the explanatory memorandum to the Bill does not make sense. How will the Minister ensure that when one has sold one's house at current use value, one will get an equivalent house at current use value?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I reinforce this argument from the farming point of view? When we discussed the 1973 Act we went over this again and again. We discussed existing use value then in relation to land that was not development land, roads and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) has made the very valid point that it is almost impossible—particularly in the case of farms—to get a comparable holding if one is dispossessed. Up to now the farmer has got the market value when he is confronted with compulsory purchase. I accept that after he has paid his capital gains tax, or what will now be development gains tax, he will probably have made more than he needs to transfer to another farm. But this measure goes quite the other way. He will be penalised and the net result will be that he will fight every compulsory purchase order. He must do this. He will also go to great lengths to ensure that he turns the local authority's attention away from his land. This will be the subject of the exercise from now on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V008P0I1066">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2111</span>
If the Minister will give a little, he will save himself an enormous amount of trouble. My purpose is to improve the Bill. We think it is a bad Bill in its entirety, but this would ease matters; it would oil the wheels to a certain extent and it would perhaps allow purchase by agreement. Otherwise, if the clause goes through, the chances of getting purchase by agreement are nil.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clegg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To supplement what my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) said about agricultural interests, I turn again to the guidance notes, where we find the switch to current use value in a few cases, although, it is said, the transitional arrangements have been devised in such manner as to minimise the risk of that happening. The provisions in Clause 29—the hardship fund—are designed to deal specifically with the problem, and the note continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In particular paragraph 52 of the White Paper promised the Government would consider whether the switch to current use value meant that any special provisions were needed to protect working farmers. The conclusion was that the ability to apply to the Financial Hardship Tribunal for an additional payment was the best way of providing this protection."</p></blockquote>
From that we see that Ministers are expecting trouble and have set up the financial hardship tribunal to deal with it. But I do not find that acceptable, because of the limits that have been set.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return now to the point which was raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page). I can see that the situation as the Minister sees it, if, as he says, one had a current use value world, if all were current use value, would be so, but it will not be so. There will not always be properties which a person hopes to buy at current use value, but if that person is going into a new development—which many of those who are bought out by local authorities will do, because that is where they will have to move to—he has to pay market value. Suppose that a business is involved: there will then be a lease on market value terms which reflect the development value. That does not mean that every property will be available at current use value, especially when the State has intervened, as it must do on a widening scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is where I think that the Minister's thesis is wrong. It will not be entirely a current use value world. It will be a mixed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2112</span>
world, some at current use values and some at market values.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important part of the Bill, as all hon. Members agree. May I return to our friend the farmer? Then I shall deal with our friend the householder, because it is the same case which hon. Gentlemen opposite are putting forward, but with different implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A farmer has his land acquired under the Bill. The first thing he receives is the current use value of the farm. I am speaking now of the farmer in his capacity as a farmer, not of a farmer in some quasi-capacity as a land dealer. He loses his land and receives the current use value for the land, the price which he would receive for selling that land as agricultural land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to that, if the land were acquired compulsorily he would be entitled under various provisions in the Land Compensation Act to a farm loss payment. In addition, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, if there were anomalies in the situation—this would be rare, but it could happen if there were anomalies—a further net is provided in Clause 29 through the hardship tribunal, which could award him additional compensation in a case of hardship. That is the instance of a farmer in that capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further point to be made about the farmer. I cannot conceive of a situation where a farmer as a farmer being dispossessed of land that he farmed would consciously choose to buy development land which was to be built upon, only to go through the whole process again. He may do it because he is thinking in terms of a capital gain on the land, not on the farm, but he would not do it in the other situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has misunderstood. All the farmer is interested in is setting himself up in an equivalent home. It is his livelihood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. That is exactly what he would do. In such circumstances he would sell at current use value, he would receive the various items of compensation that I have outlined, and he would buy at current use value, unless he was so ill advised as deliberately to seek to buy land that he knew was ripe for development in order to go through the whole process again. Farmers are not so stupid as to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V008P0I1067">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2113</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clegg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The circumstances could arise. After all, we are talking about 10-year land banks which local authorities are to hold. Land may well not be available to him at current use value, and if he wants to continue farming he may have to buy at market value through the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the same point in relation to the farmer. I shall come on to the right hon. Gentleman's householder in a moment. Let us look at the difference between market value and current use value. The only difference between market value and current use value is that any additional value due to the possibility of carrying out relevant development is removed. If there is no such possibility, current use value is the same as market value. Development value can only be removed either by a move to current use value or 100 per cent. development land tax. There is no difference. The farmer would not be in any prejudiced position after the second appointed day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman mentioned a person selling a house. A person selling a house will, as now, sell the house at its value as a house—that is the price that he will get—and when he buys he will buy a house at its value as a house. So the situation envisaged by the right hon. Gentleman does not arise, except in one instance. If a person were not really selling as a householder, like a farmer not really dealing as a farmer, but as some form of land dealer, wanting to sell a house, knock it down and build a big block of flats on the land, he would be prejudiced because the increase in value would accrue not to him but to the community, partly to the Treasury and partly to the local authority. But in selling as a house and buying as a house, a person will sell at the value of the house and buy at the value of the house. Therefore, unless he wants to knock the house down and build something more lucrative, he will not be in the prejudiced position that the right hon. Gentleman suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have explained this fully. I assure the Opposition that most of their fears about the clause, including the fears that I know some organisations outside have expressed to them, are either totally unfounded or founded on a misconception of what the situation will be with regard to sale of land or sale of houses in a world where it is current use value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2114</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's argument is very naive. He has only to turn to his left and ask what happened under the Town and Country Planning Act 1947, when development was dealt with in this way. Of course, a two-price system came up at once. People would not sell at current use value when there was a hope of doing better. But the situationis a little different here. It seems that there will be a two-price system if what the Minister says is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The private individual, according to the Minister, will sell at current use value, but the local authority will sell at market value. There may well be a difference between those two even in the case of a house. Suppose that the vendor is living in a fairly old house—50, 75 or 100 years old—just the sort of house that might be in a proposed development area. He has to sell to the local authority at current use value, no matter that under this development system it is perhaps for something else entirely, because we are altering all the other compensation laws under this clause. He sells at current use value and then looks round to see where he can find the same size and type of house. He has to house his family because they have not yet grown up and gone away, so he is looking for the same sort of house. What does he find? He finds an estate developed by the local authority, and far more expensive houses there than at current use value anywhere else, because the local authority is making a profit out of it. Because it becomes a monopoly eventually—this is what the clause is aimed at—he has to meet the price required by the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.0 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It cannot be said that in a dwelling house, a business or a farm, the vendor can get enough money to rehouse himself or put himself back into business. I come back to where I started: the argument is naive if the Minister thinks there will be sales at current use value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think my arguments are naive. They may be simple, straightforward arguments. The complications are in the minds of hon. Gentlemen opposite. They are erecting an Aunt Sally, an edifice that does not exist under the Bill, and then knocking at it, sniping at the ideas they have built up.

It is essentially a simple concept. The right hon. Gentleman envisages that a man will sell at current use value and then find that the only house he can buy is a house at an inflated price at which the local authority is selling. The local authority will be selling at market value. It must sell at market value, because it is in competition with other vendors of other houses. Indeed, in a way it is not the local authority which is selling at all, as the right hon. Gentleman knows; it is someone who has bought from the local authority, in all probability having acquired the freehold and erected the house. True, he will buy at market value, but he buys at market value at present anyway. The local authority cannot have a pool of houses built on development land that will be priced much higher than others not built on development land. Clearly, the situation would be ludicrous; no one would buy them. The local authority operates in a market value situation.

The right hon. Gentleman hinted at another matter mentioned by the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon)—"a little something to oil the wheels", I think were his words—a little something to give an incentive to let land out.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clegg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no intention of withdrawing the amendment. I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's explanation. He has been accused of being naive, and he probably accuses me of being naive, but there is a two-tier system. There is a market value system and a current use value system. Out of this system the State expects to make between £600 million and £900 million a year profit. I may be naive, but somebody will pay for that, and it will be the poor suffering citizen.

	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 9, Noes 10.</p>
	<p>669 is already covered. For the purpose of assessing the compensation, paragraph (	<i>a</i>) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"except as provided in paragraph (	<i>b</i>), it shall be assumed that planning permission would not be granted"—</p></blockquote>
and there my amendment would add "after the second appointed day":
	<br><blockquote><p>"for any relevant development either on the land or on any other land …".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>As the whole clause takes effect only after the second appointed day, the lesser, namely my amendment, is included in the whole and is probably unnecessary. Therefore I shall not urge it, except to ask the Minister to confirm what I have said.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V008P0I1069">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2117</span>
	<p>I come now to Amendment No. 712, which adds some words to the end of subsection (3) (	<i>b</i>). Subsection (3) as a whole is drafted in a difficult way. One would have thought that paragraphs (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>), (	<i>c</i>) and (	<i>d</i>) were all exceptions or all inclusions—one or the other—but paragraph (	<i>a</i>) is an exception, and then paragraphs (	<i>b</i>), (	<i>c</i>) and (	<i>d</i>) are exceptions to that exception. For drafting purposes, I should have thought it better to make paragraph (	<i>a</i>) part of the text of the subsection and then go on to list the other three exceptions to the exception.</p>
	<p>Having sorted that out as best I can, I understand paragraph (	<i>b</i>) to say that the assumption one makes in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it shall be assumed that planning permission would not be granted"</p></blockquote>
in certain cases
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall not be made as respects development of any class"—</p></blockquote>
and certain classes are there specified. The amendment would add at the end:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or as respects the approval of matters reserved on the granting of any planning permission which is being implemented in whole or in part by development begun before the second appointed day".</p></blockquote>
That is to make it clear that if outline planning permission is obtained and certain matters are reserved in that outline planning permission, at a latter date approval of those matters may be given so that the full detailed planning permission is eventually given.</p>
	<p>When I refer to outline planning permission, it may well be planning permission plus a few of the details but with certain matters reserved. Thus, it would be possible to start development under a planning permission and later have the conditions of that planning permission approved. At the outset of the operation of the clause there will be cases which are halfway through the planning process. The purpose of Amendment No. 712 is to deal with such cases.</p>
	<p>I do not think that I am attacking any principle here. I am trying to look at the practical cases which may crop up when the clause starts to take effect.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I deal first with Amendment No. 669? The right hon. Gentleman is quite right. Having looked at his own amendment he realises that the point is covered within the clause. To read the very words which he has read so often in reply to debates, my brief says that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2118</span>
"the amendment is innocuous though otiose. It is also defective in drafting". The right hon. Gentleman can rest assured on the first point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coming to Amendment No. 712, I thought at first that this was some sort of probing amendment, but it would seem not to be so. Really, the same answer applies to the second amendment as to the first. It is somewhat defective in drafting. The right hon. Gentleman says that our drafting is not entirely clear. I shall look at it to see whether it can be made clearer. I do not attack the right hon. Gentleman on drafting points, but the amendment as drafted would work in this way. First, it would not be logically correct to add it to paragraph (	<i>b</i>), which reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the assumption in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) shall not be made as respects development …".</p></blockquote>
The proposed amendment would then mean that the assumption in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) shall not be made as respects approval. The phrase "to be given 'before the second appointed day'" makes no sense from a grammatical point of view with reference to
	<br><blockquote><p>"as respects the approval of matters reserved on the granting of any planning permission …".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, we could not accept the amendment as it stood anyway, but I ask the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw it, because, as he knows, the amendment is unnecessary as application for approval of matters reserved is not an application for planning permission. Thus, for the compensation purposes the time of the approval of reserved matters—that is, before or after the second appointed day—would be quite irrelevant. The value will be derived from the unsuspended outline planning permission. There will be no assumption that the reserved matters will never be approved to destroy that value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to the right hon. Gentleman that this amendment, too, is unnecessary because the mischief that he thought might be created is cured by the wording of the clause itself without the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 440, in page 25, line 10, at end insert "or replacement development".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take the following Amendment No. 611, in page 25, line 29, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(7) 'Replacement development' means development that fairly and reasonably represents the replacement or adaption of an existing building or buildings by the construction of a new building or buildings or the carrying out of works (whether or not entailing the demolition of any existing buildings) to provide buildings in which the existing use of the land can be carried on being development which does not increase the cubic capacity of the buildings concerned beyond that of the existing building or buildings to a greater extent than is reasonable having regard to current levels of building costs and rental values as may be required to meet the best current development standards including appearance methods of construction, heating, ventilation and other service facilities precautions to be taken against fire and other safety measures and such other factors as may reasonably be called for having regard to the nature of the accommodation to be provided".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Here we are going back over some old ground, back to Clause 3. The Government may say that this is a repetition of Amendments No. 41 and 75. That is not so. These amendments deal with replacement developments only as an element in assessing compensation for compulsory acquisition. The earlier Amendments No. 41 and 75 dealt primarily with the right to carry out replacement developments. I told the Minister that I hoped to table an amendment, possibly on Report, but the opportunity arose on this clause in relation to the definition of replacement developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer back to the final exchange that took place on 10th June in this Committee. The exchange of views between the Minister and the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) appeared to show that the Minister was coming a little way with us over this vexed question of replacement developments. It finished on this note. They referred to Schedule 8 of the 1971 Act, and the right hon. Member for Crosby said that the rebuilding would surely be limited to the 10 per cent. increase in cubic capacity. If, however, the Minister is saying that he will allow rebuilding as often as the occasion may require and he inserts that into Clause 27(3), which is where we are today, we should certainly wish to consider it further. The Minister went on to reply that it must
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2120</span>
be rebuilding within the 10 per cent. tolerance; that is crystal clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the debate in Committee on Amendments Nos. 41 and 75, the Minister suggested that the fears of investors were unjustified, because the Government proposed that development consisting solely of rebuilding should be non-designated relevant development. This would be no comfort to potential investors. The term "non-designated relevant development" is merely a statement of intent not to make orders under Clause 20 in certain cases. Land scheme authorities would still have the power of Clause 18 to acquire the land after the second appointed day on payment of compensation assessed in accordance with Clause 27.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seemed to accept that it would be unreasonable for the compensation to be based on current use value alone. However, he also seemed to consider that the effect of Clause 27 (3) (	<i>b</i>) would be to increase compensation above current use value by a fair extent. Under Clause 27(3)(	<i>b</i>) compensation may include an increase in value attributable to the prospect of a so-called Schedule 8 development being carried out, that is, rebuilding so as to increase cubic content by not more than 10 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In present market conditions and in conditions which are likely to prevail for the foreseeable future, rebuilding operations are financially viable only if the cubic content of the original building is increased by considerably more than 10 per cent. I am sure that is the opinion of everyone who knows anything about the commercial property industry at present. Therefore, the assumption that planning permission would be granted within the 10 per cent. tolerance is valueless. Clause 27(3)(	<i>b</i>) will have no effect at all on the amount of compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the question of the length of leases, the cost of borrowing money and the actual cost of building construction today to be taken into account. The Minister suggested that replacement development is an impractical concept because it involves several factors that are not easily quantifiable. However, building costs and rental values can be established without difficulty. The other factors are those borne in mind by a planning authority when considering any planning application, and are well within the scope of the kind of issues which valuers and the land tribunal are accustomed to settle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V008P0I1071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2121</span>
Unless there is some revision along the lines suggested in Amendment No. 611, which gives the definition, it will inevitably lead to badly planned, cheaply constructed buildings—something that all of us wish to avoid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that suggestions have been made in other quarters that some sort of protection in the terms of the lease-back from the local authority might be written in to protect developers of commercial properties. I gather that this is not likely to be possible because it is an extremely difficult exercise and, if it is done at all, it will be, at the very least, extremely complicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the final page of the comments on the Bill submitted by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors on the 23rd June we read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We note the proposals to exclude from relevant development extensions to buildings up to a limit of 10 per cent. of the existing floor space on a prescribed day, and to regard bigger extensions as non-designated relevant development. It should in our view be made clear, however, that where the extension involves only the addition of one or more new storeys to an existing building, the extension will not be regarded as relevant development even though it may produce an increase in floor space exceeding 10 per cent."</p></blockquote>
The Royal Institute is asking for some give on this, too. It has to advise investors, institutions and people who have invested vast sums of money—pension and other funds—in these securities and is worried about this situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In valuing an existing building valuers take into account the existing income plus any reversionary interests in rent. They project those forward in perpetuity on the basis that when the economic life of the building comes to an end the rental value of the site overtakes it and continues in perpetuity but, under this legislation, the reversionary value of the site is nil. All property must therefore be a wasting asset, valued on a dual-rate basis with a terminal value restricted to current use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While this may have no immediate impact on value—this fact has not got home to some of the investors at present; the Minister quoted a Post Office pension fund as having invested a substantial sum of money recently but I do not think that it has dawned entirely on the people involved in the business of investing these vast sums—in the medium term the value of the existing investments held by insurance companies, property bonds and pension funds could be substantial. This will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2122</span>
therefore affect the savings of virtually the whole population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister consider once again, although we have debated this fully, some definition of replacement development? That is why these amendments have been tabled this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to say only a few words in support of the amendment because I used the argument in earlier amendments when we talked about relevant development and, of course, those arguments apply with more force here because we are now talking about a loss of value to those investors in this type of property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These, if I may say so in all modesty, are splendid amendments. The hon. Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Ross) has scored 10 out of 10 for drafting. The last one was proposed by the hon. Member and every word, comma and full stop of the amendment was fully accepted. I hope that the same thing will happen this time. The amendment sets some difficulty in valuation but here we have it proposed by a member of the Institute which knows how to value in these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has descriptions which are not usual in a statute, nevertheless they are commonsense:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to a greater extent than is reasonable having regard to current levels of building costs and rental values as may be required to meet the best current development standards …"</p></blockquote>
and it then ends:
	<br><blockquote><p>"‖ having regard to the nature of the accommodation to be provided."</p></blockquote>
I am sure there will be no real difficulty for those qualified as surveyors to advise on how to apply those words to any particular case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend this amendment, for it will relieve the anxiety of many who invest other people's money in this sort of building. The pension funds invest money of small contributors in this way, and may well reduce the value of a pension fund very severely unless some such amendment as this is accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Minister for Planning and Local Government (Mr. John Silkin)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought I detected in the words of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) that slight hesitation that occasionally comes to him when he realises that he is either moving or supporting an amendment which is impractical or extremely difficult of realisation. One can always
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V008P0I1072">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2123</span>
detect it because the right hon. Member is a man of incredible integrity and it comes ill from him—it hurts him—to argue a case when it is not perfectly put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He rather gives the game away on this amendment by saying that it would be difficult to judge this for valuation purposes. That is really an underestimate. In saying this, incidentally, I am dealing first purely with the technical side of the amendment. I am not totally impressed with the fact that there is a parentage to this amendment which goes to the science of valuation itself. The right hon. Gentleman and I throw it across the Committee from time to time that our own profession—we are always most altruistic about this—would be rewarded by such and such an amendment or clause, and we are all very noble about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore I shall not say that surveyors and valuers will be giving themselves a splendid job here but that would, of course, be the effect. There really would be no firm basis of valuation whatever, and the tolerances which are implied in the amendment would be so wide as to increase the amounts of compensation payable probably to absurd levels. The right hon. Member for Crosby hesitated just for a moment over the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to a greater extent than is reasonable …"</p></blockquote>
and
	<br><blockquote><p>"having regard to current levels of building costs and rental values …"</p></blockquote>
Oh dear, Mrs. Jeger!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to look at the amendment, not in the light of the words put down, but in the general light. Here there is a point of principle and it divides both sides of the Committee. There is no good blinking at it—it is a fact. The whole basis of the current use value world is that we shall have positive planning by the planning authorities. Again I give the Uthwatt definition that I recently quoted—the unification of planning and ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that in acquiring land at current use value an authority will buy that land at a value much lower than it would be today. That is the whole point, and there is no going back on that. Indeed, it is the only way in which the authority will be enabled to carry out its purpose of positive planning. That is what current use value is all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2124</span>
5.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So there is no give I can offer on this. It is true, as both the hon. Gentleman and the right hon. Gentleman said, that we discussed this matter in a different context, but in principle, when dealing with Clause 3 and relevant duty. But I repeat that the motive power behind the current use value basis is that of positive planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having accepted, reluctantly, that this is the principle of the Bill, why do the Opposition—either party, since they appear to have a minor coalition on this amendment with both sets of names listed—want to expand the basis of Schedule 8, once the Third Schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be worthwhile relating to the Committee a little history. The original 1947 tolerance was 10 per cent. of cubic capacity. The years went by, and in February 1963 without—if my memory is correct—any objection from either the Labour Party or the Liberal party, the right hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Sir K. Joseph), who was then Minister for Housing, first introduced a White Paper and then introduced a Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper of 1963 explained the basis in paragraph 20. It said that it was necessary to restrict Third Schedule rights. Those Third Schedule rights were restricted because the Government of the day, with the agreement of the then Opposition parties, wanted to be able to control the growth of office development. That Government said so quite clearly and quite logically. So that whereas the 1947 Act had allowed a Third Schedule tolerance of 10 per cent. of cubic capacity the 1963 Act that followed the White Paper—introduced by the right hon. Member for Leeds, North-East, together with Lord Barber as he then was not—restricted the 10 per cent. tolerance to floor space.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore find it strange that the parties opposite should be going so much back on their history. This side of the Committee agreed with the basis and, of course, continued it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That, of course, was dealing with planning permission, not with compensation. Here we are dealing with compensation and land being taken away from its owner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but the basis must be the same. The right hon. Gentleman does not want to make false or unfair
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V008P0I1073">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2125</span>
points. It comes back to the loss of money either way. The fact that the tolerance was being restricted meant that the value of the land itself was restricted. That was true under the 1963 Act. It does not matter whether one talks in terms of compensation or in terms of value—there was a loss of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But this did not end in 1963 because, in our old friend the 1971 Act, again these provisions are found. They are in Section 278 and Schedule 18 and heartily endorsed by the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends. I do not like turning down amendments which the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Ross) argues so forcefully, but he will understand from me, as I understand from him, that we are dealing with a pure point of principle in which neither of us can meet the other. There is no half-way house. There are two points of view. If one believes in positive planning, and if one believes that one of the great tragedies of the towns and cities in which we live has been the gross overdevelopment of urban centres and that this must be put right and can be put right only by positive planning—if one accepts that—and hon. Gentlemen opposite do not accept it; they take a totally different view—the motive power behind it must be the current use value basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must, therefore, stick to the 10 per cent. tolerance which was the basis of planning legislation introduced in 1963 with the agreement of all Parties by a Conservative Government, was re-instituted in 1971 by a Conservative Government, and which today remains at the root of the Eighth Schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has argued forcibly, and I go quite a long way with him when he talks about the planning restriction of the 10 per cent. increase in cubic capacity. I am afraid that the horse has already bolted, as we see if we look round the skyline of this city. The developers and certain architects have had a field day, and the job has been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me—and I do not disagree with the reasoning behind the restriction on further enlargement, for that is what it is—is that in the last few years vast sums of money have been invested in the security of city office buildings in many cities in this country, particularly
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2126</span>
in London and in places like Portsmouth, and investments have been made by pension funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is on a very important point, and for once I shall look at it not from the point of view of the acquiring authority but from the point of view of someone whose future pension is invested in pension funds. Would not the hon. Gentleman agree that if a pension fund is invested in the possibility that at some time in the future, an office may get planning permission for rebuilding above Eighth Schedule rights, it is the investment of pension funds in something speculative? Would he not also agree with me that in general one would expect pension funds to take a less enterprising—if that is the word—view of how their pensioners' funds should be invested?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. I have never been raised to the giddy heights of advising pension funds. This is generally left to the big boys in the City. But I come back to the fact that this has happened; it is a 	<i>fait accompli.</i> I go along with the party opposite, and other hon. Members on this side might agree with me, in believing that some of the things that happened in the early part of the 1970s, when pension funds and others invested vastly in office blocks and in property developments generally, have not been to the advantage of this country. It might have been preferable if they had invested in industry and in other directions. That is where the return is to be had, and they, as people managing pension funds, had to get the best return, so this is why they did it. They are not speculative people, but they are prudent in what they do, and they have vast sums to manage.

Now they face the situation, these investments having been made, of this legislation clobbering them hard. Their values must have dropped substantially already. I think that in future investment it will be very difficult for them to plan how they will last in the future and how they will be able to pay out the pensions to which they are already committed. This has an effect on a very wide circle of the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to keep interrupting, but this is such an important point. I presume that pension funds have

also, for example, been invested quite liberally in quoted securities. Is it the hon. Gentleman's view that Her Majesty's Government should come in and subsidise them on the loss that those stocks have now taken?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At least investments stocks and shares go up and down. This one is being killed stone dead with one Act of Parliament. However, the Minister understands the point and I will not pursue that further. I accept that the definition of replacement development may well have many holes in it. It is not an ideal definition by any means. But I think that the point has been made—we have made it before and we must make it again—that we really must consider how we can help in this situation. A later amendment in my name, put down very late, seeks to increase the value from £25,000 to £50,000 for those faced with hardship. I wonder whether that figure ought not to be £500,000 or £500 million. Certainly it ought to be a substantial sum as some of these people may well feel very hard done by and may wish to claim on that fund, so that £25,000 or £50,000 will not go very far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel strongly about this. I feel that we must make a gesture. Therefore, I hope that other members who have signed this amendment, and who incidentally all had copies—I do not claim any priority for it, I just happened to table it earlier—will support me, as I think that we ought to divide the Committee on this issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clegg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly intend to support the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Ross). I feel compelled to intervene because of the Minister's reply and what were almost allegations against my right hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the only allegation I made was of total integrity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clegg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I will leave the hon. Gentleman to look after himself, although the right hon. Gentleman is giving him too many shocks this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the Minister confuses the issue when he says that these tolerances existed in other planning legislation. Of course, they did. But in that situation the owner of the land retained the ability to apply for planning permission. Here that right
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2128</span>
is being taken away from him, so we are in a quite different world. That is why I support the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I found the Minister's optimism about what would happen to city centres under the new system quite amazing. Some local authorities have been responsible for some pretty horrid achievements, and some planning committees ought to be thoroughly ashamed. One has only to look at the South Bank of the Thames. The developments that have taken place since we planned the South Bank have been—I was going to say something I should not—worse than they were before. If one wants to see some rain-scarred, dreary batches of concrete, one need only look over to the South Bank at the Festival Hall and the new horror being put up next to it. The planning committee who designed that must have gone to the battlefields of the First World War for their model. The right hon. Gentleman's optimism in that respect is based on no foundation whatsoever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman went back into history in relation to the 10 per cent. tolerance. My recollection is that when this was introduced in 1947 the main argument was that the planning authorities should have control of the working population of the cities. It was particularly aimed at that because of the difficulties over transport and services at that time, shortly after the war. The planning authorities wished to have that control over the working population of the cities, so this particularly applied to commercial property in the larger cities. But it only provided that the owner should ask for planning permission if he wished to exceed that tolerance. It might well be refused, of course, but the refusal when this was really effective was mainly on the question of services to the population to be housed—I use the word "housed" in the metaphorical sense—to be working in the building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman then went on to say that that was reported in the 1963 Act and tidied up a little, with a little more restriction. Again, in 1963, it was necessary for the planning authorities to control the working population in the cities. He then came to our old friend, the 1971 Act, which was merely consolidation and which does not carry his argument any further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2129</span>
5.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What carries my argument further is that in the recent Finance Act, when we were dealing with the matter of taxation, it was recognised that the 10 per cent. tolerance was quite insufficient in modern office building. It was insufficient to take account of the fire precautions, heating and ventilating and all the things one expects in a modern office building. In that Finance Act there was added to the 10 per cent. tolerance for the purpose of that Act a provision for lifts, heating, garage space and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the right hon. Gentleman, in response to the amendment, at least to look at the Finance Act and see whether he could not include—if he is discarding the amendment—that extension of the tolerance which was accepted by his own Government. I remember arguing strongly, on much the same basis, that the 10 per cent. tolerance would not take into account the sort of things which every planning authority would wish put in a new building—fire precautions, heating, ventilating, garage space, lifts and so on. That is one way in which he could partially meet the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I go even further than that. I think that what we used to call the Third Schedule tolerance—which we now call the Eighth Schedule tolerance—is out of date as a figure. Looking at the rather piecemeal amendment in the Finance Act, it might be that instead of reciting 10 per cent. plus lifts, heating, garages and so on, that figure should now be increased. Instead of the 10 per cent., a round figure of 15 or 20 per cent. could be taken, which might meet what we want to achieve by the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is a practical one. It is not ideological or anything like that. We know now that in order to build a modern building to replace one 50 years old, one should not encourage the developer to try to fit into this small tolerance. The things which must be put in a modern building go beyond that 10 per cent. tolerance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the right hon. Gentleman be good enough to say that he will look at this, and thus meet the amendment to some extent, at least in my mind—I am sorry if I am binding the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Ross); I do not intend to do so—by taking into account the rather piecemeal amendment of the Finance Act or increasing the amount of the tolerance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2130</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the hon. Gentleman's grey hairs, I always hate to quarrel with him on matters of history. But I fear I must do so. The Third Schedule to the 1947 Act related to compensation, not to planning permission. It has a long history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the Third Schedule of the 1963 Act—which became the Eighth Schedule—this restricted the cubic capacity and translated that into net floor space. In other words, it cut it down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman admits to parentage of the 1971 Act, which he says was all consolidation. If he did not like it, he need not have consolidated it. He could have scrubbed the whole lot if he had wished to, but he did not, and quite rightly. I have always said that he should be proud that he introduced it. It is much better to have that consolidation Act of 1971, and, if he remembers, I said so at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would much rather that the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Ross) divided the Committee on the amendment. It is right that he should, because this is clearly a matter of principle. But entirely without prejudice—this is not meant to ask him to withdraw his amendment, because I would much rather he did not—I shall look at the Finance Act, because I have to confess I do not know it, and if I do not know something I like to look merely to reassure myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is totally without commitment or undertaking. I do it because I have respected the views of the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), as he well knows, over a long time. I would be doing an injustice if, he having made the point, I did not examine it. That is done as a separate matter, and I ask my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 662, in page 25, line 19, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or after the date of the compulsory purchase order".</p></blockquote>
This is by way of a probing amendment. We are dealing here with compensation, and in particular with compensation arising from C.P.Os. It therefore seems that we ought to add to subsection (3)(	<i>d</i>) the words of the amendment. It is meant as a safeguard. I shall be interested to hear whether the right hon. Gentleman says that that safeguard is already there in some other place. On the surface, its addition seems to us appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been told, I think by the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) or perhaps the hon. Member for North Fylde (Mr. Clegg), that I read extremely well. So I shall start, if I may, by reading my brief—extremely well, I hope, and dulcetly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition may have in mind a case where an owner knows his land is included in a C.P.O. for a particular class of development which at the time is not relevant development. He therefore does not object to the C.P.O. Subsequently, the definition of relevant development is changed, and that particular class of development is now included, but by this time the C.P.O. has been confirmed and he has lost his opportunity of objecting. But the answer to this is that objections to C.P.Os. relating to questions of compensation are invalid under the existing provisions of the Acquisition of Land Acts, and will continue to be so under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a splendid theoretical answer to the amendment, but I must say that it does not totally convince me. If I were someone subject to a C.P.O. in these circumstances and I had not objected to a particular C.P.O. because
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2132</span>
I understood it to mean one thing, if times changed and it meant something totally different I should have a case for complaining that I had been conned. It may not necessarily be true, but the hon. Gentleman's amendment has me thinking. As he is probing, I cannot give him anything beyond what I term the "official reply". I do not find it all that convincing but it worries me and I should like to take it away and look at it. There may be something in the Opposition's anxiety on this issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful for the right hon. Gentleman's depth of probing and with that I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rossi</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 670, in page 25, line 19, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>e</i>) no account shall be taken of any diminution in value of the land attributable to its inclusion in a disposal notification area".</p></blockquote>
Subsection (3) is concerned with the matters to be taken into account or disregarded when assessing the amount of compensation to be made on acquisition by local authorities. There are four matters set out in subsection (3). This amendment seeks to add a fifth matter to be disregarded in assessing the compensation to be paid by a local authority on land acquisition. The matter that we wish to be disregarded is the extent to which the value of the land may have been depressed by the fact that it has been included in a disposal notification area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning we had a long debate upon disposal notification areas and the effect that they could have on the value of property. To some extent there was disagreement about whether or not there would be a diminution in value of land included in disposal notification areas. It would be wrong for me to rehearse
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V008P0I1077">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2133</span>
the whole of the arguments that we had this morning on that particular matter. That would simply invite the right hon. Gentleman to rehearse his arguments and we will be no forwarder at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel that there will be a diminution in value. Time alone will show whether or not that is the case. If there is a diminution in value, we invite the hon. Gentlemen to agree that diminution which has been brought about by the local authority should not be held against the owner of the property. On the other hand, if we are wrong and historically it is found that no diminution takes place and this factor need not be taken into account, it will cause no harm to have it in the Bill because it will not affect the situation. On the options that are open, we ask the Government to relieve the owner from the loss that he will suffer by this action of a D.N.A.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have just said, if we are wrong no harm would be done by putting this provision in the Bill because it would not be effective. There are Acts of Parliament that have been enacted in which words exist that have never needed to be invoked. That in no way harms or invalidates the Act of Parliament. It is a longstop safeguard in case events happen which the Government consider unlikely to happen but which the Opposition feel may happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.0 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that we are not going to rehearse what was said earlier today on Clause 25. The Government agree that there could be circumstances where there would be a diminution in value. We would not accept that there would always be a diminution in value, but there could be circumstances where there would be a diminution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment because it is not necessary. There is already provision—not in this measure, I agree—in Section 9 of the Land Compensation Act 1961, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No account shall be taken of any depreciation of the value of the relevant interest which is attributable to the fact that (whether by way of designation, allocation or other particulars contained in the current development plan, or by any other means) an indication has been given that the relevant land is, or is likely, to be acquired by an authority possessing compulsory purchase powers."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2134</span>
Section 9 covers the situation which the hon. Gentleman spoke about by use of the words "by any other means". This would be one of the other means whereby Section 9 could be invoked. Nothing in Clause 27 or in any other provision of the Bill will affect the application of Section 9 of the Land Compensation Act 1961. Therefore the position will be that, both during the transitional period and after the second appointed day, no account will be taken, in assessing the compensation, of any diminution in value of the land attributable to its inclusion in a disposal notification area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that satisfies the hon. Gentleman. It is not in this Bill. It is in other legislation. The amendment would certainly do no harm but it is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rossi</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. Certainly he has indicated that he accepts that there could be diminution and that that diminution should be disregarded in calculating the compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only thing that remains to trouble me in this matter is that professional advisers and others, coming to this legislation to consider its implications on behalf of their clients, will look at Clause 27 and see the criteria laid down. It may or may not occur to them to take into account all the other matters that are raised in other legislation. There is no guarantee that they will have the advantage of reading the words which the hon. Gentleman has just pronounced, so they may not appreciate fully the meaning of the words in the 1961 Act, "by any other means". The connection may not exist in the line. Therefore I think that it would be of advantage—if the amendment in the form we propose is not acceptable, for drafting reasons—at least to have a provision incorporating, by reference, the provision in the other Act to which the hon. Gentleman has referred. It would then be easy for a professional adviser to take advantage of the cross-reference he would find under Clause 27 and refer to the earlier Bill. He would have before him all relevant legislation, instead of having to refer to a textbook which one of us may have to write at the end of these proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is making the point which, as he knows, I have often made myself. It was our clear intention to resist the amendment—I certainly could not accept it as it stands.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2135</span>
We have here a divergence between parliamentary draftsmen who, quite rightly, do not wish to burden an Act of Parliament with constant references to other Acts and we practitioners who would prefer them to be within the pages of one statute, rather than have to search throughout Halsbury or something similar to find whether the words "by any other means" are capable of bearing this kind of meaning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall look again not at the amendment but at the possibility of putting in a reference like
	<br><blockquote><p>"Section 9 of the Land Compensation Act 1961 shall apply to the provisions of this Act".</p></blockquote>
because it may arise again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rossi</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clegg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 666, in page 25, line 20, after "section", insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall not apply to a dwelling house which is in the occupation of the owner or a member of his family but otherwise shall".</p></blockquote>
I am full of hope, because when the Under-Secretary of State spoke earlier this afternoon, he said that owner-occupiers had nothing whatsoever to fear from this clause. If they were bought out they would have current use value compensation, and when they were buying they would have to pay only the current use value price. Therefore I can see nothing in this amendment for the Minister to resist. It merely puts into words what the Under-Secretary said this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Anybody who did not know the hon. Member for North Fylde (Mr. Clegg) might think that he was somewhat naive. Those of us who know him, love him and have seen him in operation as a Whip in times gone by, know perfectly well that that is the last thing he is. So, in answering his amendment and explaining why I must ask my hon. Friends to resist it, I am really talking for the record, because I suspect that the hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well why I shall resist it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, let us see to what extent—I maintain that it is a full, and above a full, extent—the promise to the owner-occupier has been fulfilled. In any
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2136</span>
event, in the vast majority of cases where ordinary dwelling houses are acquired, the current use value under Clause 27 will be exactly the same as the market value. There is no question about that. In addition, we have already moved towards further assistance for the owner-occupier—indeed, for the man who is an owner-occupier but who wishes to be a little more. That is what the Clause 4 exemption is about. It provides that where there is a development consisting exclusively of the building of a single dwelling-house for the owner or an adult member of his family as their sole or main residence, and the land is owned at White Paper date, that would not be included in relevant development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, as we have indicated already, the exclusions from relevant development will cover all improvment, alterations and extensions to dwelling houses provided that there is no material change of use. The Government have said that this will be covered by their regulations under Clause 3(1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, to protect the owner-occupier and others, they will also embrace all changes of use of buildings to or from a dwelling house and the conversion of a single dwelling house into one or more flats, or 	<i>vice versa,</i> provided again that there is no major enlargement or rebuilding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am merely drawing together and demonstrating for the record alone how far the Government have gone and why it is that the owner-occupier has nothing whatever to fear from acquisition under the scheme at current use value. However, what is lost is lost in common with every other citizen under the Bill for the benefit for all citizens. What is lost is the prospect of a large scale development and of being able to have that value for himself because the local authority will be able to acquire it at current use value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no disputing it. Fond as we are of one another, the hon. Gentleman and I have to disagree in principle. There is the possibility of a house with a large amount of ground which would, fortuitously, have an enormous amount of value because it could be development land. That now will go. The principle of the Bill is the ability to plan that development. The effect of the value which the community itself has created will go
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V008P0I1079">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2137</span>
to the community. That is the basis of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However lovable the hon. Gentleman is, he is not naive. He knows that this is the great divide between himself and me and if he wishes to turn that divide into the more natural basis of a Division across the floor of the Committee I, for one, will not object, but I shall be saying, "No".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clegg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I soon had my hopes dashed to the ground. The right hon. Gentleman has set out what he considers are the advantages which he has given to home occupiers. One of the difficulties of this type of Bill is that there is never just one head. It is a hydra-like monster. There is a concession here, a concession there, this document, that document, the Minister's explanations in reply to Questions, development land tax, and a great many other things. So if one sometimes gets a distorted view it is not surprising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the house with some land attached to it—obviously there is no garden if it is a terraced house—probably current use value is fair enough in certain circumstances. I have three-quarters of an acre of land and it would be quite possible to put a small bungalow on part of it. Suppose I wanted to sell that land. To begin with I should lose 80 per cent. to the development land tax. If the land was taken over from me I should get current use value but would there be many other properties that I could buy at current use value? That worries me. To be able to move into the same sort of house which is not immodest—a house in three-quarters of an acre—shall I not have to pay market price rather than the current use value I received for my own?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course the hon. Gentleman will pay market value for the house that he moves into should he decide to move. One is never certain whether the hon. Gentleman wants to move because every time he puts an advertisement in the local estate agents, he sees what the agent makes of it and decides that he would rather not move.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But assuming that he wanted to, the market value and the current use value are exactly the same. There will be no difference whatever in the value of the houses. Market value in a current use value world is the current use. The two will be the same, therefore the price he
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2138</span>
will receive, if the local authority acquires the house or he sells it to a private individual, will be the market value. It will not include development value, but neither will the house he buys. If the house he buys includes development land,—I must say that is an odd way of buying a house, I should have thought he would want a nice house with a garden, free from development—something else has intervened: the local authority will take the development land. In so far as he wants to buy a house, it will naturally be the same. I thought my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary was putting this point over clearly, concisely, and aptly. Market value, current use value in many cases will be exactly the same, and nowhere more obviously than in the case of the private dwelling-house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My hon. Friend said this earlier this afternoon. I heard him a moment or two ago say that this is so. We are jogging back over the previous clauses. That is why the blight provisions are so important. I do not mind that the hon. Gentleman voted against me on the D.N.A. clause. I know he did it with the best will in the world and out of total ignorance. The fact is that the D.N.A. clause gives the owner-occupier rights, and above all it gives him the right to serve a blight notice. That is precisely what would be needed in the case he has put. We have been over that ground, and it really is not applicable to this particular situation, nor is it applicable to the point that his fictitious hon. Friend had just asked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask a simple question? I may have misheard the interchange between the Minister and my hon. Friend. Is it the market value of hereditaments as a whole? Is there a restriction on the amount of garden or land that goes with the house? In other words is it market price of a house with a quarter of an acre or a quarter of a hectare, or whatever it is, or is it the total hereditament?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The quarter of an acre the tenth of a hectare, situation occurs in the transitional period. It is important from the point of view of development land tax and was referred to in the document that my right hon. Friend produced in his explanation of development land tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I have to put to the hon. Gentleman is that of course it is different in the transitional period. The treatment is different, because we have development land tax. Under Clause 27 we moved into a current use value world. There is a total difference, and it is right that there should be. I have to meet a reasonable and fair objection—two objections, really. I have to meet the objection that local authorities are not necessarily geared up to deal with the curernt use value situation; some will be, but most will not; they will not be for many years. Therefore I need a transitional period so that they can be geared up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second legitimate point is that, if I did not have a transitional period, there would be a total drying-up of development. I have to meet that; therefore there is a transitional period, a development land tax and not a current use value. Equally, this gives to the owner-occupier of land which has a development value within the tenth of a hectare—I prefer to look upon it as a quarter of an acre, having still not got used to hectares—the opportunity of making money which he would not be able to make in a current use value situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could we get it clear what the right hon. Gentleman means by current use value? Suppose the area in which the prospective vendor lives has become a designated area with certain relevant development in that area and his house is restricted by that designation. He sells that house at current use value and moves to an area which is not yet designated and purchases a house with a gar-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2140</span>
den of, say, an acre. In that situation there is a lot of hope for development because non-designated relevant development could be carried out in that area. Although he may have the same accommodation as previously, a house and garden, he will have had to pay a lot more for it if he has had to pay at market value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the right hon. Gentleman is getting tired. It is a very reasonable thing at this stage of the situation—[	<i>Laughter.</i>] I am not being facetious I really that. If the right hon. Gentleman were not tired he would realise that what we are talking about is the second appointed day. The second appointed day comes in only when the duty is in every area throughout the country. Therefore a person could hardly move, in a C.U.V. world, from a duty area to a non-duty area and have C.U.V. applied. It would not be so in either case but would still be under development land tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the right hon. Gentleman that I am not getting tired. I could prove it by giving an hour's speech on this. If one does not carry every syllable of the Bill in one's mind throughout these debates it does not mean that one is getting tired. In such a complicated Bill it is a little difficult to remember all the provisions at any one time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both the right hon. Gentleman and I from time to time have a kind of mutual admiration society. I was hoping that he would say that in view of my magnificent explanation of the difficulties under this series of amendments he would expect me to be a little tired and as a result of this, in order to assist me, no more amendments would be moved by hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this Amendment we are to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 664, in page 25, line 27, leave out subsection (6) and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(6) Notwithstanding anything contained in this section the amount of compensation in respect of an interest in land payable to a person who acquired that interest by way of a bargain at arms length prior to 12th September 1974 shall not be less than the amount of the consideration for which that person acquired that interest together with interest thereon at the rate of 15 per cent. per annum".</p></blockquote></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 663 proposes to add another subsection to Clause 27. The purpose of the new subsection is to prevent the Bill being retrospective. Anyone who purchased property before "White Paper day", 12th September 1974, could not have known what value was to be taken away from him by this</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2142</span>
	<p>dashed out from the public seats. Is she looking for her Member to come and vote?</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee having divided:</i> Ayes 8, Noes 10.</p>
	<p>Bill. To a large extent, therefore, the Bill is retrospective on transactions which happened before White Paper day.</p>
	<p>The amendment proposes that where property has been acquired before White Paper day the amount of compensation should not be less than the smaller of two sums that are set out in paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>) as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>a</i>) the value of the consideration for which that person acquired that interest in the land …"—</p></blockquote>
an amount of interest is added—and,
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>b</i>) compensation that will be payable apart from this section."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>The amendment therefore restores the position that applied before the White Paper to any person who bought their property before that date. This would delay the operation of the clause fully from a compensation point of view. It would not defeat any other provisions of the Bill but would merely be acting fairly towards a person who acquired property before he could possibly have known about the provisions of the White Paper, and, eventually, of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must resist these amendments. There is full protection in the transitional period—and I explained on an earlier amendment, on which we disagreed in principle but there was no question of my explanation being doubted—that there are a number of ways in which the transitional position has been preserved. I gave an undertaking on Second Reading—I believe it appears in column 239 of the OFFICIAL REPORT—that I would give adequate notice of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V008P0I1082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2143</span>
the change to current use value so that people would have sufficient time to make their appropriate dispositions, if necessary by sale to an authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the person, whoever he may be, referred to by the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) is not the victim of retrospective legislation. He has plenty of time to deal with his property. For example, if he has planning permission he can begin development immediately. This development is then included in current use and is protected after the second appointed day. If he does not have planning permission there is nothing to stop him applying for it. Then, under Clause 22, he will be able either to sell the land to an authority—this will, of course, be net of D.L.T. but that will be calculated on the last transaction based, including the 15 per cent. interest allowed, so he does not lose anything there—or he can get an unsuspended planning permission which, again would be preserved within current use value by virtue of Clause 27(3)(	<i>c</i>). Alternatively, he can sell the land without applying for planning permission either to an authority or privately, and the person to whom he sells it privately will himself use the last transaction based on the assessment of the D.L.T., and the person to whom he sells the land can in his turn apply for planning permission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, Mrs. Jeger, he is fully protected. I reiterate that the whole purpose of the transitional period, apart from the time needed to gear up authorities to deal with a current use value world and a duty world, is to enable development to go ahead—indeed, to encourage it to go ahead—so that those who wish to make the development shall not be impeded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of this, these amendments are not of such importance as the right hon. Gentleman believes. The difference again between him and me is that he does not believe in the public acquisition of development land, and I do. That is really what it comes to. These amendments, like so many on this clause, go to the principle and not the application.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is quite right about the difference between us on this, but in this case he has argued that there will be plenty of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2144</span>
time for persons to adjust their holdings of property, apply for planning permission and so on. We have not a clue from the Bill what is meant by plenty of time. The right hon. Gentleman has, said that he will give adequate notice of when he will move on to the second appointed day, but I do not know how many years this will be or what he means by plenty of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from that, surely he was thinking almost entirely of land ripe for development—development land; but this clause applies to all property compensation, for whatever purpose the property is acquired. We are not thinking just of land which is lying fallow and is ready for development, whose owner ought to apply for planning permission and proceed with its development. The right hon. Gentleman wants to enforce positive planning and make people get on with development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there are cases to which this clause applies where the owner could not possibly have known that his compensation would be reduced from that to which he is entitled under the present law. Again I take the case of a house being required for demolition because of the building of a road. The owner acquired that house some time ago, the law gave him a certain right to compensation, and now the home is to be taken away from him and his compensation quite probably reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the sort of case which will not always go to the hardship tribunal, because, as I understand hardship, that would be hardship to the individual, and the owner who is not financially badly off will not get far before the hardship tribunal. He will lose here, and his loss will result from the retrospective effect of this Bill on a transaction which occurred before 12th September 1974.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is not much that I can add. The illustration that the right hon. Gentleman gives is a fair illustration of the difference between the two points of view. Here is somebody with a house, whose house will be paid for at market value. He will not lose by that. What he will lose is the chance he himself never even knew he had, of making a bit extra purely because of the interests and needs, the work and exertions of the community. I could not have found a better illustration of the great divide between us. If the right hon. Gentleman and his Friends wish to turn

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 28 provides for the
	<br><blockquote><p>"Compensation payable in transactions between certain authorities"</p></blockquote>
and provides for alteration of the Land Compensation Act 1961 and the Land Compensation (Scotland) Act 1963 by order by the Secretary of State. Under subsection (2), the Secretary of State is given power to alter the existing statutes so far as he "considers it expedient" so to do. This goes a very long way in merely using the words "expedient to make" without any reference that they shall be consequential upon the provisions of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording normally used is more restrictive. I suggest that the normal wording is to make any modifications to existing statutes "necessary or reasonable" or some such phrase, "having regard to the contents of this Bill". After all, all that is necessary here it is to adjust those statutes, if they require adjustment—and frankly, I cannot see where this adjustment is needed—only for the purposes of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to look at these words again. It is true that the regula-</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2146</span>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 9, Noes 12.</p>
	<p>tions made to modify the statute will be laid before the House. However, they will come before the House not on an affirmative resolution but on a negative resolution—annulment by resolution. It is therefore quite possible that they will never be debated in the House. We know only too well that if regulations are subject to the negative procedure they seldom now find a place in the time of the House. So it is quite possible that the Secretary of State might use the very wide powers here to alter the existing statutes without Parliament ever debating those alterations. I therefore ask the right hon. Gentleman to look at this.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess that, when the right hon.

But it seems that there is an answer—a fairly technical but, I am glad to say, rather simple answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where the Secretary of State wishes to make amendments they will not in fact be consequential on this Bill. They will be consequential on the development land tax. I think that the rest follows from that. I hope that this satisfies the right hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it frightens me all the more.

I do not necessarily want the use of the word "consequential", but the word "expedient" should be directed in some way towards the provisions of the Bill or the provisions as they may affect D.L.T. by this Bill. It is far too wide for us to pass as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 677, in page 26, line 3, leave out "may" and insert "shall".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Amendment No. 676, in page 27, line 30, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and section 27 of this Act shall not come into force unless and until a draft of the regulations has been so approved".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause deals with the financial hardship tribunals and enables the Secretary of State to set up such tribunals. Our argument that the Secretary of State "shall" rather than "may" make regulations for this purpose rests on our belief that such tribunals will be necessary. We believe that there should be an obligation upon the Secretary of State to set up these tribunals, that it should be mandatory upon him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government, according to the notes kindly supplied to us, are optimistic about the transition to current use value. They hope that in the event there will be few cases where acquisition at current use value will cause genuine financial hardship. They nevertheless acknowledge that it is difficult at this stage to forecast with any precision what difficulties the change in the compensation code might in practice cause, or what individual circumstances could give rise to a justifiable claim of financial hardship from the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government at least allow the possibility of hardship. The Opposition
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2148</span>
take a rather less sanguine view. We go so far as to ask that Clause 27, which provides the means by which the final transition to current use value is effected for all land compensation, should not come into force until the regulations establishing hardship tribunals have been approved by resolution of each House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crux of our case for these amendments is that we believe there will be hardship cases. The Government seem to be uncertain, but even they, as is made clear in the notes, accept that there will be some people who entered into commitments in good faith on the basis of the development value of their land and, despite the transition period, may still suffer in consequence. In that sort of case, where the Government are a little uncertain as to the precise effect of their legislation, they should cover that doubt fully and accept that the establishment of these tribunals should be mandatory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Conway (Mr. Roberts). I find it extraordinary that we should have the word "may". I go further than my hon. Friend. It is quite clear from the notes on clauses that, however sanguine we may be about the number of cases of financial hardship, there will be such cases. Paragraph 2 of the notes on Clause 29 goes so far as to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is hoped that in the event there will be very few cases where acquisition at current use value will cause genuine financial hardship."</p></blockquote>
We have had a lot of best endeavours. Now we have the best hope that there will be very few cases, but it is recognised that there will be cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since current use value is likely to be less than acquisition cost plus the cost of the improvements in a number of cases after the second appointed day there is likely to be financial hardship. While we welcome the inclusion of a provision to allow the creation of financial hardship tribunals, against the background of the expectation that at best there will be only a few cases, it must be right that the Secretary of State "shall" create those tribunals, instead of once more introducing that element of flexibility that we have so often come across in the Bill—allowing the Secretary of State to do so if he feels like it, or if he does not feel like it to leave it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I call in aid the argument of Justice
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V008P0I1085">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2149</span>
about the Bill. The committee of Justice firmly feels that there should be an obligation on the Secretary of State to set up a financial hardship tribunal. A number of other outside bodies which have submitted evidence on the Bill have supported that case. It is clear from that evidence that there would be less unhappiness about the provisions of the Bill if this change could be introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that the Minister will say that he finds merit in our argument, and perhaps also merit in the drafting, because it seems to be drafting on which it would be difficult to go wrong. I hope that the amendment can be accepted not only in spirit but as worded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have enormous sympathy with the hon. Gentleman, having moved so many "may" and "shall" amendements in my time. It is always the same thing, and always the same difficulty. When one tables an amendment, one thinks "This is an absolute winner; it is bound to be right". Only when one moves it does it become more difficult, and one goes round and round trying desperately to think of a good reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is this. I do not think that Justice or any other organisations, however hard they search, will find a financial hardship tribunal mooted in any other legislation. It is something pretty well unique. That being so, the bona fides of the Government can hardly be impugned. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to intervene, though it seems a little early—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to impugn the right hon. Gentleman's bona fides, but does he not recognise that, luckily, we have no legislation which allows people's property to be bought from them at less that it was worth the day before the Bill became an Act? That is why not only we in the Committee but many outside bodies see a strong need for the creation of financial hardship tribunals. Past unhappy experience in this matter reinforces that argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that. If I had not myself thought—and it was a personal thought—of financial hardship tribunals, I doubt that there would have been an amendment on the Paper sug-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2150</span>
gesting them. I do not think it is unique by any manner of means that land is acquired by an authority, whatever that authority may be. It has been happening for years, and anyway that is rather off the subject.

The question is whether we have "may" or "shall". The point is simple. I know that the hon. Gentleman is not impugning the bona fides of the Secretary of State or the Government, but that is precisely the point. The reason why it is in the Bill is that my right hon. and hon. Friends have agreed that there should be a safety net, just in case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nobody can say what the situation will be when we reach current use value on the second appointed day. We hope that we shall have covered all the hardships that can possibly occur. We feel that we have gone a good deal further in the transition period, and we do not know how long it will be. We do not expect any, but they may happen. If that is so, there will be some pressure to use what is in the Bill for the tribunals to be set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But let both hon. Gentlemen be under no illusion. The setting up of financial hardship tribunals will be an expensive business. There is no question about that. It will have to be judged at the time. If there are no hardship cases—and there may well not be—what is the point of going to the expense now of saying that we will set up such tribunals?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking of years ahead. Who knows? It may be that the hon. Gentleman himself would oppose the setting up of a financial hardship tribunal by a compassionate Secretary of State on the ground that it was totally unnecessary and far too costly. It is much better to wait until the moment and then see. That is what we are asking this Committee to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I found difficulty in following the last part of the right hon. Gentleman's interesting argument. Unless one has a financial hardship tribunal, how can one determine whether there are cases of hardship? Without the tribunal there will be widespread public feeling, fanned by alarmist reports in the Press, that there are such cases of hardship. One of the functions of a financial hardship tribunal—it is clear in both the guidance notes and the Bill—is to determine whether this is a real or an imagined grievance.

Negative information, as the right hon. Gentleman knows, can often be as valuable as positive information, and a clear independent assessment that hardship has not occurred would be reassuring to the public on some occasions. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]

As I said in my earlier remarks, one of the functions of this clause is to reassure the public, who have no little alarm—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Could we have quiet? It is difficult for the Chair and for our Official Reporters if there are conversations going on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying, there is a past record here, an unhappy record which I do not wish to discuss now. This amendment follows a good precedent. As the right hon. Gentleman has said, Oppositions propose that "may" become "shall", and Governments wish to retain the flexibility in the word "may".

Against the background of the history on land legislation, there is a strong case
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2152</span>
for asking the Government to reconsider, particularly when it is difficult to determine whether hardship has actually occurred unless one has this independent tribunal to make a judgment on that very question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the right hon. Gentleman wants to water down this provision. This is one of the key provisions of the Bill. Unable to provide proper compensation for those who will suffer under the Bill, he says if anybody suffers hardship—I notice it is financial hardship and not, as I was saying on an earlier amendment, personal hardship—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is a Division in the House. Do I take it that it would be for the convenience of the Committee if, after the Division, we immediately take the dinner interval and resume at half-past eight?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
