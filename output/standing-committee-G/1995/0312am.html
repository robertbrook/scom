	<div class='title'>FUNCTIONS OF RENT OFFICERS IN CONNECTION WITH HOUSING BENEFIT AND RENT ALLOWANCE SUBSIDY</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [7 March]:</i> No. 348, in page 53, line 17, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(8) In section 5 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 (regulations about claims for and payments of benefit), after subsection (1)(r) insert—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'(s) for enabling requests for reasons for a determination affecting a claimant and for a review of such a determination to be made by an agent for the claimant.'.".—[	<i>Mrs. Maddock.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Gwilym Jones)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For housing benefit, requests for a statement of reasons or review by an agent or representative need only to be countersigned by the claimant. There is no great bureaucratic structure surrounding the treatment of representatives, whose only aim is to resolve particular difficulties for claimants. However, the only group to readily benefit from the amendment would be landlords seeking to take advantage of their tenants through the housing benefit scheme. I am sure that none of us want that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock) seeks is already provided for. If practical problems arise in particular parts of the country, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security would be more than pleased to examine them. I urge the hon. Lady not to press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Diana Maddock 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the Under-Secretary says. However, it is the view of various bodies, including many housing aid centres, law centres and citizens advice bureaux, that the amendment would assist them. Perhaps it will help if I pass on their views to the Department. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>New Clause 26</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>HOUSING BENEFIT SUBSIDY TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>'Housing Benefit subsidy payable by the Secretary of State to local authorities in respect of council tenants, shall not be less than the costs incurred by the local authority on housing benefit for its tenants.'.—[	<i>Mr. Burden.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Burden 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Northfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move that the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording of new clause 26 may not be ideal. If Ministers accept that there is a problem, I should be happy to consider a better form of words. However, I am not holding my breath for a positive response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. A lot of conversations are going on in the Room at the moment. I would like to hear what the hon. Member is saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If Ministers follow the logic of the argument that they put to the Committee recently, there is no reason why they should not accept the principle of the new clause. When we were talking about housing in multiple occupation, we urged a national licensing scheme, but Ministers said that they were not centralisers, did not try to impose on local authorities, and trusted them to do the right thing by their communities. We found that somewhat out of character, given the Government's recent performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if the Government have had a change of heart and now trust local authorities to do the right thing, there is no reason why they should not accept at least the principle if not the wording of the new clause. The trouble is that Ministers have shown themselves too often to be compulsive cappers, capping council tax and local authorities' use of capital receipts. New clause 26 deals with the capping of housing benefit subsidy to local authorities. If the new clause is not accepted, many local authorities will be faced with swingeing cuts in the repair and improvement programmes for their council estates—or council tenants will face quite unreasonable rent rises. That will be the result of policies introduced by Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing benefit subsidy is unlike other housing benefits. It is not paid to council tenants; it is discounted from their rents by local authorities, which are then reimbursed by the Government. The changes in the rules governing housing benefit subsidy were slipped in by the Government at the end of last year. What council house and council flat tenants pay through their rent has become more important during recent years. The capital programme of local authorities has been cut ruthlessly because of the restrictions placed on housing investment by central Government. The housing revenue account, which is ring-fenced, is now much more important in terms of it being used to put right major structural repairs in council housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been estimated that Birmingham need about £1.3 billion to remedy the problems in its council stock. Borrowing approvals will not meet that cost. Birmingham local authority consulted its tenants to try to solve the problem. It did not like the situation that it was in nor did it agree with the borrowing approvals. More than half of its properties did not have central heating. Too many council tenants were being forced to live in cold and damp
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0323">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>567</span>
surroundings. An agreement was reached last year between the local authority and its tenants to raise rents by £2 a week to start a 10-year programme to fit UPVC windows and central heating in some of the worst housing blocks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the programme continued in the following year and the housing revenue accounts balanced, there would be a requirement of about £19 million. To maintain that programme, rents would have had to be increased by between £3 and £4 a week. However, now the Government have stepped in and said that if a local authority raises the rent for its tenants by more than the guideline rent increase, which was set not by the local authority or the tenants, but by Ministers, they will not reimburse the housing benefit subsidy that is discounted from tenants' rents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of last November, there was a "consultation"—it is always in quotes. Little publicity was given to it, but its consequences could be serious. Local authorities and tenants will have to make a choice. The poorest tenants who qualify for housing benefit would have to pay more rent, which they could not afford. If they could afford such rent, they would not have qualified for housing benefit in the first place. Alternatively, tenants who are not on housing benefit would have to make up the difference between the housing benefit discount and the refusal of the Government to reimburse it. Under that option, to raise the amount of money that last year's rent increase of about £3 to £4 a week would have raised, council house tenants in Birmingham would have to pay £10.17 a week extra.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The choice that is left is to cut the programme and forget about the central heating and the UPVC. As a result, people will have to continue to live in damp and cold surroundings. There will be a cost to the health service and to the families who have to live in such surroundings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not just Birmingham that will face those problems. If the rule changes had been in place last year, Birmingham would have lost about £10 million, even though Birmingham tenants would probably have paid only an extra 50p a week. If we take the rule changes that will be imposed in the financial year 1996–97 and apply them notionally to what would have happened last year in other local authorities, there would have been a loss in rent income of £380 million to local authority housing revenue accounts. In Brent, for example, rents would have had to have risen by £14.70 a week rather than the £7 actual increase. In Croydon, average rent rises would have been £23.40, rather than £8.85, and in Liverpool average rent rises would have been £10.20, rather than £4.11. That makes a mockery of Ministers' claims that they want to trust local authorities. They do not trust local authorities to consult tenants and they do not consider the local consequences of Government policies—not local authority policies—on cutting capital investment in council housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not surprising that local authority associations have not welcomed that. George Meehan of the London housing unit said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it makes a nonsense of consultation with tenants on the balance between rent and service levels. Any housing policy Mr. Curry may have had has been supplanted by a housing benefit control policy."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>568</span>
It is a real problem. The Committee has many important matters to discuss today, so I do not want to detain it for long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cirencester and Tewkesbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman concludes his speech—I detect that he is on the point of doing so—can he tell the Committee the cost implications of his proposals for the taxpayer? Given that housing benefit already costs £12.5 billion, how much more would it cost to accommodate his proposals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should understand that housing benefit bills would not be so high if the Government had a more sensible overall housing policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How much?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the crazy housing policies that the Government adopt, it is inevitable that housing benefits are high, and a choice must be made whether the cost is spread among those who can just about afford it or among those who are least able to afford it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How much?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the hon. Gentleman wants to intervene, he is at liberty to do so, but he should not heckle from a sedentary position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government's policies and rule changes force the entire cost on those who are least able to afford it. That is the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Clifton-Brown) that housing benefit is expensive because of the Government's policy to increase rents, especially in the private sector. Driving tenants into the private sector is expensive, as tenants are told by their landlords that they can claim a rent of £100 a week, for example, from housing benefit. I hope that my hon. Friend will remind Conservative Members that the way to reduce the cost of housing benefit is to reduce rents—that is an obvious equation. It is alarming that Conservative Members have the brass neck to ask why housing benefit is expensive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I let the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) finish his sentence, but I remind him that interventions should be just that—if he wants to make a speech, I should be happy to call him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is entirely right. High housing benefit bills are the consequence of the Government's crazy housing and economic policies. If they had more sensible policies for the economy, fewer tenants would have to claim housing benefit. However, we are not addressing those issues today. We are discussing how to put up with the consequences of the policies that the Government have already imposed, such as cutting back housing investment and ring-fencing the housing revenue account. Faced with those policies, is it reasonable that in my local authority in Birmingham
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0324">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>569</span>
that, if you get together with your tenants and, faced with an impossible situation, decide to go for a modest rent increase to fund vital improvement programmes, you will be effectively prevented from doing so by Government diktat?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Gentleman intervenes, I must point out that there were a lot of references to "you" in the remarks of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Burden) and I have done none of the things of which the hon. Gentleman was accusing me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has proposed a fairly simple new clause. Will he be very kind and tell the committee what will be the implications for the taxpayer? A clear answer would be appreciated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rent rebates, as a percentage of rent received last year for Birmingham, were 71.5 per cent. If the hon. Gentleman would like the figure for his local authority, I can give it. I can also give him figures for other local authorities. That is testament to the failure of the Government's economic policies. I say again that the issue is not whether the Government's policies should have forced so many people into relying on housing benefit, but whether local authorities are reimbursed fairly for housing benefit so that they do not have to attack tenants as the Government are forcing them to do. This is what the new clause is about. I am sure thqat the wording can be improved, but if the Minister is serious about trusting local authorities, why cannot he accept the principle of the new clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Diana Maddock 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Government Members need to be reminded of the history of housing benefit. I can remember when local authorities were asked to take on the responsibility of administering housing benefit. I remember the promises that they would not incur extra costs as a result. In recent years, extra costs have landed on local authorities year on year. None of us ever envisaged that the costs would land on tenants, which is what has happened. That is insidious. That is the background to the issue, and it is why many of us feel angry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned some of those issues when I spoke about the independence of housing benefit review boards. Such factors interfere with decisions because boards know that costs will be higher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most members of the Committee would agree when housing revenue accounts were ring-fenced, unacceptable practices were occurring across the board. In some authorities, the housing revenue accounts reduced local rates and, in other areas, the opposite occurred. People accepted the reason for ring-fencing housing revenue accounts, but nobody ever imagined that further intentions would result in some tenants subsidising other tenants on housing benefit and curb the ability of local authorities to improve their properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury asked about the cost resulting from the new clause. The Government's estimate for the amount of surplus in 1996–97 is about £1.5 billion, but we claim that that
	<span class='label label-info column'>570</span>
money would be spent on improving local authority stock. The Government have said that it is essential that the surpluses should not be available to cushion bad practice and inefficiency. I hope that in his response the Under-Secretary will say how many authorities have been using the money to cushion bad practice and how many have been using it to improve properties. We might be persuaded, but I doubt it: local authorities should have as much freedom as possible. If they are administering housing benefit, tenants should not be paying for that—the original promises should be kept. I look forward to hearing the Under-Secretary's figures to back up the Government statement that the surpluses should not be available to cushion bad practice and inefficiency. I entirely support the motives behind the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Northfield suggested, the new clause is intended to deal with the new housing revenue account subsidy rule to be introduced in the coming financial year. The rule will limit the subsidy on rent rebates to guideline rent increases only and is intended to encourage councils to keep rent increases within the guideline rent increase. It does not affect the right of claimants to benefit, nor will it affect those authorities which increase their rents in line with the guideline increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The background to the new rule is that rent guidelines will be frozen in real terms over the next three years. It is necessary to ask authorities to hold management and maintenance costs per dwelling broadly steady in cash terms over the next three years. The hon. Member for Northfield prefers that local authorities should have the freedom to ignore the request for restraint and fund higher spending by putting up rents above inflation while passing 66 per cent. of the cost to the taxpayer. It is only reasonable to limit the contribution from the taxpayer to the guideline rent increase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Under-Secretary explain why the Government now say that local authorities should restrict rent increases to a guideline that is essentially in line with inflation when, two years ago, they were advocating that local authorities should increase their rents by 5 per cent. above inflation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because we now feel that we have reached the appropriate position where we can ask local authorities to keep their rents at that level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the particular point raised by the hon. Member for Northfield, we acknowledge that a small minority of authorities, faced with unavoidable expenditure of an exceptional nature, might need time to adjust their housing revenue account budgets to within the constraints implied by the public expenditure plans. That is why we are prepared to grant exemptions from the new rule if an authority can demonstrate that exceptional circumstances apply in its case. To date, 28 authorities have applied and nine requests have been granted either in full or in part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bearing in mind the picture that the hon. Member for Northfield painted of the situation in Birmingham, I find it inexplicable that his authority has not applied for an exemption. There has been no opportunity to consider the case in accordance with the provision that we have made for the small minority of authorities which could be in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0325">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>571</span>
such a situation. I can tell him that the new rule uses existing 1995–96 rents as a base, so existing 1995–96 spending levels are protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultation was real. The original proposals were amended to reflect concerns of the local authority associations. More generally, under both the HRA and non-HRA rent rebate subsidy arrangements, the new clause would remove the incentive for authorities to act prudently. If full subsidy is payable in areas where authorities have discretion, for example in the case of overpayments and the backdating of awards where, under the current arrangements, limited rates of subsidy apply, there would be no encouragement for authorities to reduce the level of overpayments and expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal of the hon. Member for Northfield would fetter the discretion of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to distribute subsidy according to the relative need of each authority. There would be less subsidy available to pay towards the housing costs of the needier authorities. The alternatives would be to cut £1.25 billion a year from other expenditure or to raise the sum from extra taxation. That is the answer to the very pertinent question posed by my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury. Accordingly, I strongly resist the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to refer to the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Northfield in moving the new clause because there is substance in them. There is a great deal of concern within local authorities about the effect that the new regulations will have on tenants who receive housing benefit and on the improvement, maintenance and repair of council property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A constituent of mine—a former mineworker—received an 80p a week increase in his occupational pension, immediately after which his housing benefit was reduced by 57p a week. That is how people are treated under the housing benefit scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier this year, new regulations were introduced because the Chancellor of the Exchequer demanded in the Budget that the Department of Social Security must reduce its expenditure. The Department immediately tried to reduce the cost of housing benefit. However, as I said in an intervention the cost of housing benefit is high because of the way in which the Government have forced councils to increase their rents and the fact that private sector landlords, whom the Government rely on to provide rented accommodation, say that they must charge a certain rent—the average is about £100 a week—to provide accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 11 of the housing benefit provisions states that, if any family, elderly people or those who are not working cannot afford to pay any part of their rent, they should be reimbursed under the housing benefit scheme. That is the crux of the problem. The Government have forced people into high-rent properties. Landlords have been known to tell potential tenants that their rent will be £100 a week and that that amount can be reclaimed under the housing benefit scheme because of the tenants' circumstances. That is the evil of the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead of asking what the cost of the new clause would be, Conservative Members should ask Ministers why so much housing benefit is paid at present. The answer is
	<span class='label label-info column'>572</span>
that rents are high, especially in the private sector. The cost of housing benefit is a mater for the Government, not for me or my colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem is that two Departments deal with housing. The Department of Social Security sets the amount of housing benefit, and the Department of the Environment sets the number of houses that are available. In January, the Department of Social Security published a leaflet on the new rules that were to be set because of Budget provisions. Those rules were set without serious consideration of their consequences; the Chancellor of the Exchquer demanded that the Department of Social Security should cut its expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The leaflet says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What happens if I don't have enough money from my Housing Benefit to pay the rent?"</p></blockquote>
The Department of Social Security suggests:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You can ask the landlord if he will charge less rent".</p></blockquote>
Does the Department think that a landlord who can charge £100 a week will reduce the rent if a tenant receives only £75 a week housing benefit? The landlord will evict that tenant and get in someone who can pay £100 a week. Yet the Department has told people to ask their landlord to reduce the rent. The Department also suggests:
	<br><blockquote><p>"you can look for cheaper accommodation."</p></blockquote>
That is cloud cuckoo land. The Department's advice is unreal. The Department does not know what is happening in the housing world. It is not easy for someone who gives up a tenancy of £100 a week to go around towns and cities to look for a tenancy of £75 a week or £50 a week, depending on the grant level that has been set for a property. The leaflet says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In cases of exceptional hardship, your council may be able to give you more help. You can ask your council about this."</p></blockquote>
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is right that councils should have discretion to help people, the new clause moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Northfield is the way to implement the principle laid down by the Department of Social Security. The Department of Social Security gives that advice to tenants and potential tenants, but the Department of the Environment tells local authorities that it will restrict the amount of money available for housing benefit. Capping of council tenants' rents will cause severe problems in the maintenance of properties. Most of my postbag—and most of the representations made to me at advisory meetings—concerns housing matters. Many housing questions arise, but one important issue is the improvement of the quality of housing—such as the removal of metal window frames installed in the early 1950s. Councils want to remove such window frames, but without Government assistance they are handicapped in how they can help tenants. The Bill and the regulations will make it more difficult for them to help their tenants. All that my hon. Friend is proposing is that if it costs a local authority £x to meet the housing benefit bill, it should have the same opportunity to recoup the cost in full as applies in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Logic should apply and be seen to apply, and the proposals of the new clause are constructive and acceptable. It would benefit tenants throughout the United Kingdom if they received the co-operation and help that they expect from their local housing department, which is their landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0326">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>573</span>
I challenge the Under-Secretary to consider the issue and to explain why tenants in the private sector should have their rent refunded in full if the rent officer has decided that that rent is realistic, but local authorities, whose rents may be much lower than those recommended by the rent officer—as they are in Wakefield in my constituency—will not have the housing benefit costs that they incur refunded in full. How does the Under-Secretary justify there being two systems—one applying to the public sector and another to the private sector? Perhaps there is a reason for that; if so, will the Under-Secretary explain it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to re-emphasise the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton. Why should local authorities receive unequal treatment compared to other bodies? Will the Under-Secretary provide us with a list of authorities that have applied for the extension that he mentioned, because of the difficulties that they face? We need to know which authorities have not applied for an extension, so that we can ensure that they are aware that they can do so. As my hon. Friends have said, the cost returns to tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Bradford, 50 per cent. of the authority's housing stock consists of flats and maisonettes in need of repair. As the Under-Secretary will know, many regeneration schemes—which are welcome—are in progress, but the only way forward for the remaining estates that need improvement is through the help of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we have asked the Government why they are against local authorities providing social housing, Ministers have said that they do not believe that they should—that that should be done by bodies such as housing associations. But tenants choose to be tenants of local authorities and want to be assured that local authorities will meet their housing needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that my hon. Friend the Member for Northfield is seeking through the new clause is equality of treatment. The Under-Secretary must explain why inequality exists. I look forward to his convincing us that the difference is necessary. If he cannot do that, he should accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I waited until the Under-Secretary had finished speaking. I asked him whether he could cite any research to support the statement that housing surpluses should not be used as a cushion for bad practice and inefficiency. I got nothing from him. He may not have the figures today, but I should like him to supply details of any research to back the Government's stance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hampstead and Highgate)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the comments of my hon Friend the Member for Normanton on the basic inequity of the Government's proposals as they redound on local authority tenants. My constituency of Hampstead and Highgate is an extremely popular part of London in which to live and private landlords have forced rents up to almost astronomical heights. It is inequitable that local authority tenants should see that the properties in which many of them have lived for a considerable time have failed to receive vital improvements, while people in the private sector, whose rent is infinitely higher in effect than that which they are paying, have been able to achieve such improvements. I should say as a caveat that in some cases,
	<span class='label label-info column'>574</span>
of course, private landlords do not carry out the requisite repairs, but payment of rent and its affordability seem to be a burden that the Government are determined to rest almost exclusively on the shoulders of local authority tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier in our debates the Committee spent a great deal of time discussing calming measures for the many estates that are riven by disagreements between tenants. One of the factors that causes great concern on some of my estates is noise. All members of the Committee can present cases of excessive noise with perhaps one tenant creating real difficulties on an estate. My local authority is examining the possibility of introducing insulation in many of its properties. That would be extremely expensive as the properties may have been built a long time ago, but such an improvement, which would have a beneficial effect for the whole estate, will be precluded if the Government fail to accept the new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Northfield.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to other improvements, there is a small estate in my constituency which was built in the 1920s by a private builder, and which was, in essence, a pied-a-terre for an intellectual element in London which at that time liked to spend its weekends in Hampstead. Many intellectuals still like to spend their weekends in Hampstead, and who can blame them? The development was compulsorily purchased by the local authority many years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The initial purpose of the block, as I said, was to act as a pied-a-terre. There were communal rooms as the individual apartments were limited in their use by tenants. Yet over the years the local authority has turned the block into permanent housing for tenants in desperate need. The drains of the property can no longer cope with the amount of water used by tenants for the basic requirements of a modern household—for example, baths and showers. As it is a listed building, the local authority would dearly like to undertake major repairs to restore and maintain it, but because of the Government's inability to take on board the realities of housing and housing need in an inner urban area like mine, that probably will not be achieved in the foreseeable future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As is shown by the social security leaflet to which my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton referred, the Government seem to believe that tenants can argue the rent downwards. As he also pointed out, many people wish to live in local authority housing and find it extremely disturbing that in the private sector they can find only three-month or six-month leases: they rarely find one-year leases. Families with children find this approach to seeking a home extremely disquieting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of my constituents expect to live longer, which is welcome, but concomitantly, if they are unable to live in homes that they have known all their adult life—or even, perhaps, as children—we are not exactly moving forward in legislative terms. I strongly urge the Government to reconsider and not to discount out of hand the new clause moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Northfield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There seems to be an unspoken perversity in the Opposition's argument that it is somehow appropriate to increase council house rents because higher rents are charged by the private sector. I deduce from that they feel that it is appropriate to cane council house tenants
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0327">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>575</span>
through rent because we would be caning only some of them and the majority would be paid for by the taxpayer. What concern for taxpayers would that signify?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference between HRA and non-HRA housing was mentioned. The HRA contains a 100 per cent. marginal rate of rent rebate subsidy for basic rate rent rebate as opposed to a 95 per cent. subsidy for non-HRA housing. Some authorities receive full cover for rent rebate expenditure, but where there is excess income from HRAs, it is only right to take it into account for subsidy purposes. After all, the taxpayer has already invested very heavily in council house stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to the hon. Member for Christchurch, this is not only a matter of promoting efficient housing services; it is about the proper targeting of subsidy lest other housing authorities that are in greater need suffer. There is the obvious connection that without subsidy there is no incentive to tackle bad practice. I have further information that will interest my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury and other members of the Committee—an extra £1 on rent each week would result in a cost to taxpayers of £130 million in additional rent rebates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting, if a little sad, that an authority is described as having an excess of income if it uses money to install central heating or repair windows. Living in decent conditions, and providing finance for this, does not indicate so much an excess of income as severe housing need and problems with housing conditions that must be tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary said that the changes will not affect claimants' entitlements to benefit and strictly speaking, in one sense, I suppose that that is so. However the consequences will still be either the cutting back of improvement programmes or other tenants making up the difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members have talked about costs falling on taxpayers. Have they forgotten that council house tenants are taxpayers? Indeed, it is the taxpayers who will have to foot the bill for the housing benefit subsidy caps. I hope that Ministers will think again about this matter, which more than just affects a small minority of local authorities. The House of Commons Library estimates that if the provision had been applied last year, 138 local authorities would have been affected. Cost will apply in any case—there is cost for not doing up housing stock and forcing people to live in poor conditions. I will not press the new clause to a Division because no doubt we shall have to come back to the issue either during the Bill's progress or in some other public debate.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to part VI of the Bill, which deals with the allocation of housing by local authorities. It is right to put that in context because it is not a stand-alone part; it is intrinsically linked with provisions in part VII, dealing with homelessness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's thesis, which we shall no doubt hear later from the Minister and others, is that there should be one route into social housing—through the local authority housing register. The Minister will probably argue that that is the fairest way because everyone would be assessed according to the same criteria. That approach may sound plausible on the surface, but is does not relate to the real world. It may satisfy the tidy mind of the bureaucrat, or those who have beavered away in Marsham street, or the people who like the idea of everyone queuing up in the an orderly way to be assessed and then allocated housing, but real life is not like that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people need housing in an emergency if, for example, their home has been severely damaged or destroyed by fire, flood or other natural disaster. They cannot wait in an orderly queue until they reach the top of the list; they need accommodation immediately. There are scores of other examples of people needing immediate access to accommodation. People may be discharged from hospital and have no home to go back to. There are people who have no home at all; they are homeless and living on the streets. Do the Government propose that they should wait in an orderly queue in a cardboard box until some bureaucrat decides whether they have the necessary number of points to qualify for accommodation? What about young people leaving care? Will they be told, "Your fate is to go on the streets until an allocation comes up when you have been waiting on the list long enough."?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are countless more examples showing that it is nonsense to say that there is one orderly route to council housing through a single waiting list. That is not the appropriate way to deal with allocations. When people are literally homeless, accommodation must be made available immediately so that they are not left on the streets. That is simple common sense. There must be more than one route into social housing. That reality makes nonsense of parts VI and VII of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0328">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>577</span>
I have no doubt that the Minister will try to justify the Government's position, but he will be unable to square the circle. An allocation system cannot be operated solely on the basis of a single waiting list, with everyone being assessed according to the same criteria. That has never worked and it never will. Even in the days before the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977, there were several different routes into council housing. For example, there were special quotas allowed to social services departments for people whose needs would not be properly recognised under the waiting list system. Housing associations were increasingly making an impact in those years, trying to provide for people who were not adequately qualified for housing under local authority allocation systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the lessons that I, and others learnt at that time was that diversity, pluralism and choice were essential to any proper framework for allocating social housing. However sophisticated the allocation system may be, however many different attempts are made to construct a framework that will take account of every possible need, it will never work. There will always be people who fall through the net because their needs are not properly accounted for. I am surprised that a Conservative Government are currently engaged in a misconceived and vain attempt to create a single channel into social housing. The fact that the Conservative party has got it wrong causes me no surprise—it has been wrong on many issues. I am surprised by the fact that the Government are arguing for a single, monolithic, bureaucratic mechanism for allocating social housing rather than for a pluralistic framework that offers diversity and choice and recognises the range of different needs, which cannot be accommodated by a single system. I thought that Conservatives were supposed to support those values, and I hope that Conservative Members will pause to think about the intellectually incoherent and socially indefensible blind alley into which the Government are threatening to take them. If they have any doubts, they should ponder the reaction of the outside world. Why did the 10,000 or so people who responded to the consultation paper published when the Government first announced their proposals almost unanimously condemn them? It was by far the greatest response to any consultation paper that has ever been published on the subject. There was overwhelming condemnation of the Government's proposals from every interest group with any understanding of the subject. Housing associations, local authorities, voluntary organisations, tenant representatives, professional institutes and churches all said, with one voice, "Do not do it, it is wrong". All those people were correct and the Government were wrong but, sadly, the Government did not listen and proceeded with their proposals despite those representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put one other point to Conservative Members: why, in recent weeks, have housing associations been voicing their concern that their independence as charitable and voluntary organisations is increasingly being undermined by Government interference in how they allocate housing? Those bodies are not hostile or reluctant to meeting housing needs; they want to meet those needs but they do not want to do so within a rigid bureaucratic framework that will prevent them from providing housing for certain categories of people in need and make their decisions more and more subject to Government diktat. We share their concerns. We do not accept that a Minister or a bureaucrat in Marsham street should lay down the
	<span class='label label-info column'>578</span>
rules for allocating social housing and insist that every social housing agency must comply with a single set of criteria. The Minister does not accept that either but he has inherited the whole ill-conceived, incoherent mess and is desperately trying to salvage from it what he can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recent concessions announced by the Minister and publicised in the housing press last week make it clear that the Minister now accepts that there can be direct rehousing of some homeless applicants—something that was not previously possible. The White Paper made it clear that, under the new arrangements, homeless applicants could only be rehoused into temporary accommodation and then assessed on waiting list criteria for permanent accommodation. That was clearly palpable nonsense, and I am delighted that the Minister has recognised that to be the case. Together with many other people, I was surprised that, on Second Reading, the Secretary of State appeared to be unaware that that was the impact of his policy. Nevertheless, we welcome the sinner who repents, and we are pleased that the Government have recognised that the proposals in the Bill cannot work and need to be changed. The proposals fly in the face of all the good practice and common sense about housing allocation that has been propagated for years, not least by the Department of the Environment. For the benefit of the Committee, I shall quote from the code of guidance issued by the Department of the Environment on local authorities' responsibilities towards the homeless, paragraph 12.1 emphatically states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Local authorities should not require homeless people to spend a specified period in temporary accommodation."</p></blockquote>
There could not be a clearer, more precise or more emphatic statement than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To prohibit councils from providing direct rehousing for homeless applicants was clearly ridiculous and, to his credit, the Minister recognised that. He now says if 	<i>Inside Housing</i> is to be believed, that local authorities will be able to house some homeless families directly into permanent housing, without having to spend a period in temporary accommodation and then being assessed according to the single waiting list. Of course, that is not an entirely satisfactory response. We do not know how many homeless households will be rehoused directly. We are told that it may cover those who are already on a waiting list but it is unclear whether it will apply to everyone who is already on a waiting list or to only some of those people. What is the number of points on the waiting list or level of assessed need that will allow certain people to qualify for direct rehousing? The Minister has not dealt with the problem of those people who become homeless in an unforeseen emergency and who had no opportunity to get on to the waiting list beforehand. Would someone be denied the possibility of direct rehousing simply because his or her house burnt down or he or she was beaten up by a partner and became unexpectedly homeless? Would such people be required to spend a period of time in temporary accommodation rather than being eligible for rehousing?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are serious questions about the Government's proposals. Nevertheless, we welcome their shift away from the rigid and impossible framework created by the Bill However, if the Minister now accepts that it is reasonable for local authorities to offer direct rehousing to some homeless families, why have we been through this long, sad, time-consuming exercise of discussing legislation that supposedly creates a single framework for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0329">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>579</span>
allocating social housing? That is what the Bill attempts to do, and it is precisely that framework that the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977 recognised needed to be changed. If the Government have their way and insist on certain categories of homeless people being forced into temporary accommodation, and spending a period of time there before they can qualify for permanent rehousing, that will take us back to the framework that existed before the 1977 Act. Before the Act, the relief of homelessness was not seen as a mainstream housing function. The homeless were often left for long periods in degrading and squalid temporary accommodation—often in old work houses. Responsibility rested not with housing authorities but with social services departments, and the process was often disastrously damaging to families, as many reports witnessed, in particularly the much-quoted television film "Cathy Come Home".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1977 Act was introduced as a private Member's Bill by the late Lord Ross, the former Liberal Member of Parliament, whom I had the good fortune to know and to whom I pay tribute for introducing legislation that was fundamentally important to housing in this country. He introduced that Bill with the support of the then Labour Government and several honourable Conservative Members. In fact, the Bill was sponsored by three Conservative Members. When that legislation was passed by the House 19 years ago it brought the relief of homelessness into the mainstream of housing responsibilities. It ensured that housing authorities had to consider the immediate needs of the homeless, as well as the needs of others, including those on the housing register. The Act was a watershed. It put an end to the disgraceful spectacle—all too common until then—of homeless families being forcibly split, of husbands being separated from wives, children being taken into care or families being shunted across borough boundaries in scenes all too reminiscent of the harshest periods of the old Poor Law. The Act has been a success. Hence the unprecedented outrage that was prompted by the Government's proposal to repeal the fundamental provision of that Act and replace it with the proposals in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The success of the 1977 Act was recognised not only by those who were directly involved in allocating housing to people in need, such as local authorities, voluntary organisations and churches; but by the Government who carried out two reviews of the legislation. The first, was in the early 1980s when the current Deputy Prime Minister was Secretary of State for the Environment, and the second was in the late 1980s, when the late Lord Ridley and the present Governor of Hong Kong were respectively Secretaries of State for the Environment. That is an interesting and diverse range of Conservative Secretaries of State. They would not have shared the same views on many subjects, but they all came to the conclusion that the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977 was working well and did not need to be changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Objectively, nothing has changed since the completion of that last review. The number of homeless households being accepted by local authorities in England last year ^vas around 120,000—the same as the number accepted in 1989. There has not been a surge in homeless applications, taking away housing from other people.
	<span class='label label-info column'>580</span>
There has been no other substantial or significant change to justify turning on its head the conclusion of the last Government review of the legislation, which was that there was no need for a change and that the legislation was working well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now we have proposals that will fundamentally change that framework. The Government make those proposals on the basis that the current system is unfair to people on the waiting list. Yet that allegation was considered by the reviews in the early and late 1980s and rejected. The Minister will have a hard time convincing us that the conclusions reached by his predecessors in the Department of the Environment in the early and late 1980s were wrong and that his proposals are right. His argument flies in the face of logic and the conclusions of his predecessors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government may argue, and they probably will, that under current arrangements, homeless people have an unfair advantage: they have swift access to council housing that those on the waiting list do not have. That might be true to a degree, but, if so, the Minister must ponder why people on the waiting list wait longer than they should. Is it because homeless people are taking homes away from them, or is it, as the figures suggest, because there are not enough homes available for letting? In that situation, it is inevitable that homes will be given to people who have the most immediate need, such as those who are homeless, rather than those whose long-term need is just as great, but who are not on the streets on the day that their application is considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue comes down to resources and numbers, as my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett), the Chairman of the Select Committee on the Environment, has rightly pointed out in the recent report of the Committee, to which other members of this Committee have also contributed. The report pointed out that the number of homes being generated for social needs is inadequate to meet needs. In that situation, it is inevitable that those with the most immediate need will be given greater priority than those who can wait a little longer. There is, sadly, no gainsaying that conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer is not to take away housing options for homeless people in order to give better opportunities to those who are on the waiting list. The answer is to ensure an adequate supply of rented housing so that those whose housing need is the product of homelessness and those whose need is the product of other circumstances such as overcrowding and squalid conditions will all have a good prospect of being housed in reasonable time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final argument that the Minister must address is that there are not separate categories of people. There is no fundamental distinction between those who are housed because they are homeless and those who are housed because they are on a waiting list. We are talking often about the same people. A high proportion of people who are accepted as homeless have already been registered on a waiting list. They became homeless because their living arrangements broke down before there was an opportunity to house them through the waiting list. They would have been housed in any case had there been more homes available for allocation and the waiting list had moved more smoothly and quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing here with people in need of housing and we need to have channels to ensure that they have a good prospect of getting accommodation. Both types of need
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0330">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>581</span>
are genuine. I stress to the Minister and to those hon. Members who would argue that the homeless, in many cases, are seeking to abuse the system that there are safeguards in place that ensure that those who are not in genuine need can be denied the prospect of housing and that the purpose of the Bill—to ensure that there is housing for those who are not intentionally homeless—is honoured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the situation and that is what we should be retaining, which is why we are moving a series of amendments to emphasise the duty of local authorities to respond to housing needs. In subsequent groups of amendments, we shall seek to amend the Bill to give effect to what the Minister, by his latest concessions, has admitted is necessary: a separate route into permanent housing for homeless applicants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our objective is to restore the proper framework established by the 1977 Act, which has worked well and is appropriate to the needs of the homeless and of others in housing need. We aim to do so by amending the Bill, but I give notice to the Committee that, if we are unsuccessful, a high priority for an incoming Labour Government would be the restoration of a proper framework to ensure that housing is allocated to those in need—including the homeless—and that there is a prospect of their being rehoused into permanent accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that will not be necessary and that the Minister, who has recognised that the proposals that he inherited are unworkable and wrong, and who has begun to move in our direction, will move further. I also hope that he will accept amendments to the Bill and that Conservative Members will see the logic of setting up a proper framework with separate channels of access to public housing—housing association housing and social housing in general—to meet the diverse housing needs that exist. The case is based in logic and we shall pursue it through the amendments. I hope that the Bill is substantially amended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support entirely the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford). The debate is a vital part of our deliberations because it deals with a key Government measure which is based on some appalling speeches that were made at Tory party conferences at which delegates bayed for the blood of homeless families whom they saw as another group which could be categorised and stigmatised as being responsible for the social ills of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must have a rationing system for the distribution and allocation of council housing. If we are not to put it out to tender or to have a straightforward pricing system, there must be a mechanism to decide who gets which property. Before deliberating on that matter, we must re-emphasise, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich has done, that there must be sufficient properties to ration to have a meaningful and valid rationing system. That is the heart of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have come up with proposals for change in the allocation of council housing because in many parts of the country there are insufficient houses to go round to meet the genuine demand for properties from those in real housing need. The issue is not only quantity, but the quality of properties. In some parts of the country, properties are available, but they are of such poor quality
	<span class='label label-info column'>582</span>
that, increasingly and rightly, people are rejecting them because they do not want to bring up their families in properties of such a standard. There is no reason why council tenants, like any other section of the community, should not make that sort of judgment in the 1990s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tackle head on an issue that is frequently raised, not only by Ministers, but in the surgeries of myself and my hon. Friends. There is a perception among those who are seeking council housing that there is a conflict and that current homeless legislation allows some people to jump the queue. My hon. Friend was right to say that it is impossible to have a system of allocation that can take account of every circumstance. The reason behind the homeless legislation was that it was recognised that some people have an absolute and immediate need. People who do not have accommodation need to have it immediately, not after two years, and we need a mechanism to deal with that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A proper allocation policy must take account of a variety of other needs, but they are not as urgent as the requirement for a local authority to provide a property—that is what is distinctive about the homelessness need. We should recognise that, and find a different route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I readily accept that the number of people presenting themselves as homeless to local authorities has risen. In the case of my local authority, the number has increased from a couple of hundred a year at the end of the 1970s to about 1,500 a year—that is a massive expansion. I accept that an element of that is that people who would have received a home through the waiting list are now using the homelessness route, but we should ask why. In many cases, people say that they believed that, having put their names on the housing list, an opportunity would arise in a couple of years and they would be offered a house. They believed that, during that time, they could live with their parents or parents-in-law, and the family would manage. There might be family conflicts and they might get on each other's nerves occasionally, but they would cope in the expectation that a property would be available in the not-too-distant future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now, however, the waiting period has become much longer. In Sheffield, there are fewer homes available and no council houses are being built, and that is true in almost every local authority area. Families are faced with the prospect of having to wait not two years, but six, seven or eight years or longer, so they are likely to have increasingly strained relationships. They conclude that they would rather go through the ignominy of queuing at the housing department to be assessed as homeless, of having to explain their circumstances and perhaps living in temporary accommodation while their case is assessed, than live for a few more months in the family home with the strains that they are trying to cope with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is all too real for many families, which is why more are taking the homelessness route. They say, "That is the only way that we can get a property in a reasonable period of time. We can't stand the strain of living with our parents and they can't stand the strain of living with us." Such families have to live in overcrowded conditions, often with young children. In such circumstances, it is entirely understandable why more people are taking the homelessness route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will think again, otherwise he will create a further disincentive for people who live in such circumstances, however unacceptable, forcing them
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0331">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>583</span>
to live with their families for longer. He will add not only to housing problems but to general social problems and create appalling difficulties for families in such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich: council housing allocation is about need. It is about recognising the variety of needs, especially the importance of immediacy, and the different routes available into housing. I also agree with my hon. Friend that people must be given a reasonable choice. It is not good enough simply to say that just because a house has four walls and a roof it is suitable and acceptable. That, too, is unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government put much emphasis on giving choice—often supposed choice—in education, health care and other services. I should like to hear the Government start talking about choice for council house tenants. Why should they be treated differently over something that is important for all families—a roof over their heads—from any other group? They, too, have a right to choice—to something suitable for their needs. They should not be offered a home and told to accept it irrespective of whether it is suitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister recognises the difficulty caused by the fact that homeless families are sometimes perceived to jump the housing queue. He could suggest that, while not removing the need to make an immediate offer of property to homeless families, the overall allocations policy could include a mechanism to balance their needs with the needs of others—I accept that their needs, too, are real. If the Minister suggested a compromise that avoided queue jumping, but allowed immediate offers of permanent accommodation to be made, and if he linked that to a housing investment programme that met the need of quality and quantity, we would be sympathetic and try to reach agreement with him. However, while he refuses to give homeless families an immediate offer of permanent accommodation and forces them to go through the trauma of being constantly rehoused—I shall come back to that in a moment—his housing policy will not meet the real needs of homeless families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past few days, the Department of Environment has been telephoning local authorities to discover the average waiting time between tenants registering and having properties let to them. The assistant director of housing for Sheffield told me that that was a pretty meaningless statistic. How long is a piece of string? Some properties in Sheffield are available almost straight away. A property on Parkhill, unmodernised, built in the 1950s, four or five floors up—perhaps a one-bedroomed flat—would be available pretty quickly. There are even one or two houses in the poorest parts of the city—but they are in the poorest condition—that you could get in under two years. However, those who want a good quality house on a nice estate in the suburbs will have to wait an awful lot longer than two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that the proposals on homelessness will be changed and that people could be accommodated by the local authority for up to two years in temporary or interim accommodation and would get a
	<span class='label label-info column'>584</span>
permanent home within two years. Yes, they might be offered a house in Sheffield; but they would have no choice about what area it was in, and they would be effectively excluded from many areas that have houses in good or reasonable condition. That could happen even in Sheffield, despite the fact that the authority invested heavily in its housing stock in the 1980s. It used every mechanism to improve its housing stock—as the Government constantly tell us, because they tried to shut them down one after the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sheffield had a housing partnership scheme, in conjunction with housing associations and the Nationwide building society. Sheffield spent all its capital receipts on planned maintenance, including the non-prescribed element that the Government shut down by legislation in 1989. Sheffield leased central heating schemes by the thousand because it was believed right that people should have central heating. That, too, was stopped in 1989. Sheffield increased rents beyond the level of inflation—we were encouraged to do so by one Minister after another—because the council wanted to invest in housing stock. There are still insufficient houses in Sheffield; but there are many thousands without central heating, which should not be so in 1996. My hon. Friend the Member for Normanton spoke earlier about metal windows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have let the debate go a little bit wide, but it is now getting a bit too far from the main subject, which is persons in housing need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. My point is that we will be in great danger if we do not watch out. There are properties that do not meet the standards of which we can be proud in the 1990s. If an allocation policy results in certain people being offered properties that no one else wants, people in desperate housing need will be allocated the worst properties in the poorest condition. That will lead to sink estates and ghettos, and properties that are fit only for homeless families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My worry is that the route that we are going down will increasingly marginalise such people and mean that extreme housing need will be met only by the offer of properties in poor condition. That will have enormous social consequences, well beyond housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are talking about persons, not properties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is precisely because of people in housing need that we must have an allocations policy that recognises those needs—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman does not understand me. This group of amendments deals with persons, not standards of housing. That is dealt with in a different section.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is extremely important for people who are in housing need for whatever reason, including homeless families, that an allocations policy should recognise their needs and give them proper weight, so that they have a good chance of getting a suitable property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that such people have other needs related to their housing circumstances. Some will be in deep poverty and many will be unemployed. When local
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0332">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>585</span>
authorities shape their housing polices, they should be conscious of people's overall needs and wider social problems. We must ensure that the housing allocations policies that we propose do not compound those needs and add to the multiple deprivation from which so many of those families suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recognising the extreme needs of some families, I should be extremely worried if we developed an allocations policy such as the Government suggest in the Bill. That would result in many such families getting the poorest properties, and it would produce allocations mechanisms that would mean constant movement for such people, destroying the family life that has already been undermined by the initial homelessness problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposal is, indeed, a policy of constant movement. First, as a homeless person, you would have been moved from your original home. Secondly you might be offered an interim property while the authority carried out an assessment of your circumstances. Thirdly, you could be offered a temporary property for a period which, I understand, the Government will set at two years. Fourthly, if no suitable property became available during that period, you might be moved on to a hostel or a property leased by the local authority. Fifthly, you might eventually be offered a permanent home by the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the allocations policy that we are considering, it is entirely possible that people in real housing need could end up in five different houses over a three-year period. That will be not only a housing disaster for those people but an education disaster because their children will constantly have to change schools, and a financial disaster because of the expense of all those moves. Moreover, when people move so frequently, they do not invest in the property as this home and do not maintain the garden. People will not be able to get credit, because if your address changes so frequently, credit companies will not trust you. By moving neighbourhoods, people will lose their social relationships within the local community. All that amounts to a complete disaster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we do not have a housing policy that recognises the needs of those families and subjects them to constant moves, it will be not merely a housing disaster but an education disaster and a social, financial and environmental disaster, all as a consequences of getting a housing allocation policy wrong because the real needs of those people are not taken into account. I hope that the Minister will recognise that the Opposition are saying not that there can be no possibility of change but that the Bill will worsen the circumstances of those in greatest need. I hope that the Minister will listen to our arguments and change his proposals so that they meet the needs with which we should be dealing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman used the word "you" several times.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration (Mr. David Curry)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened to the hon. Members for Greenwich and for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) without intervening because
	<span class='label label-info column'>586</span>
I thought it sensible for the Opposition to set out their stall before I set out mine as we do on Second Reading. Two things struck me during their speeches. First, I am unsure whether they were attacking the proposals that I am defending. They might have been attacking something that is two or three years old, not the current proposals. Certainly, I do not recognise some of the ways in which they characterised the proposals. Secondly, I am unsure whether they were enthusiastically defending existing legislation or whether they thought that there was room for change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Attercliffe said that Labour Members did not necessarily want to defend the status quo and that there might have to be change. I noted that the hon. Member for Greenwich said, "The Labour Government would restore a proper framework for people in need, including homeless people". Those words seemed to have a carefully chosen cadence. I wonder where the difference lies in this debate, but we shall no doubt explore it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not mind the fact that people want to attack me. I have noticed that people are called officials when they do things of which one approves, but bureaucrats when they do things of which one disapproves. The hon. Members for Greenwich and for Attercliffe kept referring to "bureaucrats". I shall assert ministerial responsibility and say that they must levy whatever criticisms they have against me because officials are there to serve the Government of the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a pre-introduction—if I can use such a term—I should say that I have always thought that the heart of this part of the Bill is to create a framework in which underlying needs are assessed on a fair basis and that the rest of the provisions are a means of doing so. Therefore, where there is a case for change, where the proposals as drafted might not deliver the result that I intend, or where they might have an unintended effect, I have not hesitated to state my intention to amend the Bill. I have done so in advance, notifying members of the Committee so that they might be forewarned of my intentions. Given the constructive engagements that there have been in Committee, I have given its members a chance to know how the Government intend to move forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a moment, I shall deal with the possibilities of people moving straight into permanent housing when they are homeless. It is true that we intend to amend the duty from one year to two years, which is reasonable. I accept what has been said about averages; but when the average time for allocation is approximately 12 or 13 months, there is a good case for adopting the two-year requirement. I have said that the Government intend to insert the allocation criteria into the Bill on Report when the consultation period has ended so that the House can have an opportunity to examine the criteria. I have not hesitated to bring forward such proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have a certain view of what happens. They accuse me of not knowing what the real world is like, but sometimes I feel that their view of it is not as it really is. Homeless people often spend a lengthy time in temporary accommodation before being rehoused permanently. They are not whistled straight into permanent accommodation in a matter of days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I shall continue, if the hon. Gentleman permits me, because I heard him out. The hon. Member for Attercliffe said queue-jumping did not exist, but that there might be some incentive for it, and asked why. This reflected the comment of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), his Sheffield compatriot, who spoke a couple of years ago about the problems of the existing system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall not go back to pre-1977 days. We shall keep the 1977 Act concepts of entitlement, homelessness, priority need, intentionality and local connection. Essentially, what we are changing is the way in which the duty is to be discharged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will set out the basic principles of that because it is important that hon. Members understand what we are proposing. The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish was right to say that it was about fairness. I intend to find a way of identifying households with the greatest enduring social and physical need so that they are given priority in the allocation of local authority and housing association tenancies. It must be common ground that, whatever the volume of available housing stock, it should be allocated fairly. That is common sense. The mechanism whereby we achieve that is set out in part VI of the Bill, which provides for the route into social housing via the housing register. We are establishing modern relevant criteria for allocations. They cover not only traditional criteria relating to physical conditions, such as overcrowding and insanitary conditions, but social factors that reflect the circumstances of society in 1996. The physical needs criteria in section 22 of the Housing Act 1985, which is a consolidating measure, go back to the housing legislation of 1935. Social criteria made their entrance only in 1977,
	<span class='label label-info column'>588</span>
and only for homelessness. The Government are continuing that process of establishing more relevant criteria by which to judge each household.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraphs 26 and 27 of our consultation paper of January 1996 refer to the broad criteria for general allocations. They, or criteria that we shall add to the Bill following consultations, will, in the hands of responsive local authorities, provide the necessary security for people who are homeless because of a deep-seated need. I am confident of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new housing register—provided for by clauses 124 to 127 of the Bill—is a different animal to the existing provisions. It will be the only route into social housing allocated by local authorities; it will be dynamic, and will focus on basic underlying need rather than immediate emergency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, provision must be made for emergency help. Hence our proposed two-year duty. I have announced that we intend to amend the provision from a 12-month duty to one of two years. That is the safety net for homeless households. The vast majority of households will have their long-term need for social housing met from the housing register during that two-year period. The most vulnerable households—those consisting of very elderly people, people with a major disability or people who suffer from severe mental illness or degenerative disease—will have overriding priority on the housing register. That is also spelt out in the consultation paper at paragraphs 36 to 39.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we believe it reasonable to examine whether there is a real need for permanent, subsidised accommodation—in other words a lifelong tenancy of a local authority or housing association property. We know from research that 18 per cent. of households accepted as homeless under the present regime drop out of the system within 18 months. For example, where the homelessness is caused by a relationship breakdown, the person may find a new partner, or there may be fresh employment or some other change in personal circumstances. Accordingly, we do not believe that every instance of homelessness necessarily requires a lifetime, subsidised, state-provided tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also know from research that, at present, less than half of the households concerned make any serious effort to meet their accommodation problems beyond seeking to share with family or friends, and we believe it right to ask people to make more effort to meet their own need. They will need more help to do so, which is why we have provided new advice and support roles for local authorities in clause 139.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a prescriptive set of proposals from the bureaucrats of Whitehall or from me. In too many local housing authorities, the allocation system has grown up rather without order—haphazardly—and allocations tend to be formulaic. We intend local authorities and housing associations to have a more coherent approach to allocations, to view the pool of housing in their area as a whole and to have the discretion to design their own framework—as they have under the Housing Act 1985.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to give a better chance to one group of people: the single homeless. Some local authorities prohibit individuals below a certain age from being registered. Some authorities exclude anyone under 25 years old and in some cases further restrictions apply. We are consulting
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0334">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>589</span>
about who should have the right to be included on the housing register and, as a result, we may require local authorities to open their lists to single homeless people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me about what I was tempted to call the Laird protocol. The correspondence between my Department and the Chartered Institute of Housing provides effective clarification of what we intend. I confirm that it has always been and remains our view that the allocation criteria which are included in the Bill will allow authorities some flexibility in the operation of their allocation policies. As is the case under present arrangements, authorities will have a reasonable level of discretion, and will be able to make the immediate offer of long-term accommodation to a household threatened with homelessness if it has nearly enough priority on the housing register. Allocation will be driven not by the fact that a duty would otherwise be owed under the homelessness legislation, but by the household's underlying needs, as determined by the authority's allocation scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I shall return to that matter later. The hon. Gentleman is making frantic notes, so I am probably fated to have to speak again in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I want specifically to speak to the amendments. Every local authority is required to have a housing register, which must include all housing, with limited exceptions—transfers and swaps, succession rights, referrals, rough sleepers initiative-type move-on arrangements and discharges from mental hospitals, for example. Each authority must have an allocation scheme that reflects underlying principles set out in legislation, and the Government will set out rules about who can and who cannot be on the register. The principles are in the consultation document. The Committee will in any case be discussing the substance of those principles rather than their mechanics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to set out the basic principles underlying our proposals. I repeat what I said earlier—I have sought to make the proposals provide a fair route into social housing and to ensure that authorities assess people's long-term needs, of which homelessness is one of the symptoms. In the hands of reasonable and responsive local authorities, the measure gives them the tools to accommodate and deal fairly with those needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several amendments have been tabled to the clause. I have recognised the validity of the spirit of previous amendments, if not their technical drafting, and I have accepted that certain sentiments are valid. That will no doubt be the case with this part of the Bill. I want to find the most effective way in which to deliver the measures and I hope that the divisions between us will narrow in several areas. We shall have to make a choice, Mr. McWilliam, but I have no doubt that you will preside over our proceedings with your usual brisk efficiency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A person can have no greater need than the need for a home. Like the hon. Member for Greenwich, I pay tribute to the late Lord Ross, who was a Liberal colleague, for piloting through the original Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977. I also pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman who played no small part in enabling that Bill to reach the statute books. Both he and
	<span class='label label-info column'>590</span>
I have had cause to feel angry and distressed that something that has worked for several years and which has the support of so many people is now about to be destroyed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter has been studied repeatedly and it has been felt that the legislation works. That does not mean, however, that we do not want the position to be improved. That was the original intention of the Bill, which was probably why the Government have undertaken reviews during the past two years. However, they chose to leave the matter alone. The problem is that there are not enough affordable homes. People are falling over each other to obtain a home. The reason why accusations are made about unfairness is that the Government have cut investment in affordable homes for several years. In the Budget last autumn, they halved the amount of investment in social housing for the foreseeable future. We will be lucky if 50,000 new affordable homes are built this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has answered some of the points that have been made and perhaps he has listened to some of the criticisms that have been voiced. People are concerned about the powers that the Bill will give to the Secretary of State and the way in which the consultation process was undertaken. Church Action on Poverty, the Catholic Housing Aid Society and the Churches National Housing Coalition consulted widely on the matter and issued a briefing about it. I shall repeat what they said because I wish to give the Minister the courage to stand up to other forces on the Conservative Benches that might seek to persuade him otherwise. The organisations said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The requirement to maintain a housing register, and to publish an allocations policy is reasonable; giving the Secretary of State such broad powers to prescribe who may, or may not, be allocated housing is not. It fails to recognise the need for local authority discretion as regards local housing conditions and vulnerable cases."</p></blockquote>
It is vulnerable cases that we want to be covered by the Bill. The organisations continue:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if the Bill is passed broad powers will remain to alter both 'principles' and lists of 'qualified persons' with little Parliamentary scrutiny. It is a mechanism which could in the future be abused for political ends."</p></blockquote>
Various groups, such as under-25s and lone parents, have been scapegoated. The Bill could be abused and used to exclude those people rather than tackle their needs. They say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It also perpetuates the distinction between so-called 'deserving' and 'undeserving' poor."</p></blockquote>
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has considered such representations, and that is not the only group to have made such points. I shall quote from a briefing sent to us by the National Leaving Care Advisory Service. Some of our discussions this morning will relate to ensuring that people leaving care do not fall through the net.

The service says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The proposed legislation could provide an excellent opportunity, through specifically addressing the needs of care leavers, to reinforce the Children Act and to ensure that all Housing Departments play their part in providing suitable permanent accommodation for young people who are the responsibility of public care. However, in its present form it is in danger of eroding some of the current partnerships between Housing Departments and social services departments. In areas where the arrangement is based on vulnerability it is likely that young people will now only be entitled to short term local authority accommodation."</p></blockquote>

We have all been inundated by briefings and comments from a wide range of people. I have picked out two and I am sure that other hon. Members will mention others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Minister's statement that he recognises that two years is a more reasonable time after which to look after people. However, I remind him that to a two-year-old, two years has a different meaning than it does to a 40 or 30-year-old. It is in those years that one might end up in unsuitable accommodation. I could take hon. Members to places all over the country where children aged two cannot move around the room in which they live. Not only do they lack opportunities to play and develop mentally, but their physical development is impaired. That is one of the reasons why many of us are so concerned about the Bill. I have raised that issue previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservatives claim to be the party of the family. Many people are genuinely concerned about what will happen to families, particularly those with young children, in the circumstances that I have described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Minister's comment that he will include in the Bill matters to do with allocation. I hope that he said that from the best of intentions. However, as the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish pointed out in earlier discussions, if the Minister dealt with such matters in regulations, should there be a change of Government, there would be no need to change the legislation and the matter could be dealt with very quickly. I hope that the Minister's motives were the best.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall clarify that point, just to put the hon. Lady's mind at rest, because I am not naturally Machiavellian. [HON MEMBERS: "Oh !"] I am sorry, I did not mean to be self-denigrating. The hon. Lady usually urges me to include matters in the Bill because she has such a profound suspicion of regulation. We intend to include the provision in the Bill, associated with a power to amend by affirmative resolution in the House. That gives the Secretary of State, irrespective of his party, the ability to make amendments that may be necessary as we gain experience of how the criteria work. That is pragmatic and, I hope, parliamentary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's comment. He made his intervention at a good point because I am about to attack him further. He has managed to look me in the eye towards the end of his statements, but I could not help noticing that he was finding it extremely difficult to look the hon. Member for Greenwich in the eye when he was speaking about matters concerning the Bill. Perhaps he was thinking about what he wanted to say next, but, given the views that have been expressed, he could and is likely to be held responsible by many people across a wide range of organisations for undoing a system that has worked and has helped vulnerable people in society into some sort of stability, which is to the advantage of us all. He could also be held responsible for bringing tremendous misery to those people and also to very young children, who are perhaps the most vulnerable people in society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman could end up ensuring that such families do not get stability and that their lack of reasonable life chances is perpetuated. However, there is a chink of light: the weight of opinion has influenced the Minister, but I know only too well that he has to convince
	<span class='label label-info column'>592</span>
a great many more people. I hope that other Conservative members of the Committee will be as convinced as he is and that, as the Bill progresses, we can do away with some of the worst aspects of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has the opportunity to improve an important Bill. I hope that he will not go down in history as the man who destroyed some good legislation, but will put into practice a Bill which means that people are not denied hope and opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two issues: the supply of, and the demand for, dwellings. There is a colossal programme with supply, and perhaps, a small problem with the rationing of demand. I am appalled that the Government are turning their attention to the small problem and ignoring the large problem. That is what is wrong with this part of the Bill. The Government cannot escape the major problem that there is a lack of social dwellings in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee on the Environment spent a long time studying the matter and came up with a unanimous report which indicated that the Government were not meeting the current need for social housing. I hope that we will have heard the Government's response to the Select Committee by the Report stage of the Bill. If they keep to the two-month convention, we should hear it just in time. Therefore, I will understand if the Minister does not want to say all that much about dealings with the unmet current need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we should be clear on this point: the Government estimate is that, at a minimum, 60,000 new dwellings are needed each year, but the hon. Member for Christchurch has said that fewer than 50,000 had been provided—The Government are not meeting their own minimum target by about 10,000 dwellings a year. All the evidence received by the Select Committee suggested that the figure should be higher than the Government's range—close to 100,000 or 120,000. There is massive under-provision of social housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking into account the existing unmet need and the fact that some existing properties are unsuitable and others are deteriorating, the extent of the housing crises is considerable. The Government should be addressing that problem, but they are turning to the question of how to allocate the under-supplied houses—the lack of provision—more fairly. I must tell the Government that it cannot be done, because fairness in this area is far too subjective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to judge the needs of one person and the needs of another. I take an example of two sisters which I came across in my constituency three or four years ago. One of them married a young man who worked in the building trade as a roofer and earned a pretty good income for a short time, so he was able to buy a house. Unfortunately, he was involved in a dispute in a pub and was fairly badly knocked about, resulting in occasional epileptic blackouts. Obviously, he could no longer work as a roofer and his house was quickly repossessed. The couple went back to live with the wife's parents and they were eventually rehoused in what they considered to be one of the least desirable council properties because they believed that the council felt that they were not particularly deserving as they had fallen behind with their mortgage. Whether or not they were deserving is not for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0336">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>593</span>
me to decide. I suppose that it depends on how one regards the circumstances of the man being involved in a fight in the pub.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wife's sister, on the other hand, married someone who was in a much poorer job; they lived with her parents for some time and eventually, after a long time on the waiting list, were rehoused into a particularly attractive council dwelling. No doubt, after many years when they have built up a considerable discount, the couple will be able to consider buying that house. It is impossible for me to judge which of those couples is the most deserving. Making such choices is one of the major problems for housing departments. At present, local authorities know the law, as does local folklore. By changing the law, the Government are presenting problems for both housing authorities and the local community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[MR. GERRY SUTCLIFFE 	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people will complain, "This is unfair because so-and-so was treated differently last year." It is stupid to change a system that works satisfactorily. The system is in trouble or crisis because of the lack of provision, not because the system does not work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Interim allocation is another problem. Some of the most impressive things that the Environment Committee saw as we went around the country was the empowerment of tenants. Tenants associations were being given tremendous rights over the management and control of their own estates. One of the best ways of protecting estates from becoming sink estates is to empower tenants, but that must involve a certain continuity. It is very upsetting for a tenants association to find that its new secretary who is very efficient and chases the council is then rehoused. There is a feeling that people only become involved in the tenants association as a way of getting out of the estate. There is also the problem that people do not participate in tenants associations if they think that they will be staying for only a short time. There are problems with interim status and yet more sink estates will be created. The most important thing is to rehouse people into good permanent accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Attercliffe said, there is nothing more demoralising for teachers than to find that pupils stay for only a few weeks. One of the schools in my constituency that deals with children from one of the homeless units finds it extremely difficult to cope with children who come to the school only briefly and then go somewhere else. That poor school is pilloried because, according to the national league tables, it is not doing as well as neighbouring schools. But if children are there for only a short time and are in many cases disadvantaged, it is not surprising that its results may not be as good as those of other schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[MR. JOHN MCWILLIAM 	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Government not to change the system, but to build more houses or to enable local authorities and housing associations to build more houses. I hope that when the Government respond to the Select Committee, they will see the error of their ways and raise their sights to the higher target of social housing. If they do that, they will not need the measures that they propose in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>594</span>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly endorse everything that my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish has just said. The core of the problem is the lack of suitable, affordable accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that the Minister's response was a combined response to my hon. Friends the Members for Greenwich and for Attercliffe. He said that there must be a fair system of defining the greatest need, as though that was extremely simple. I would argue that in some cases it requires the judgment of Solomon to decide whose need should have priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the homelessness bulletin issued by my local authority, Camden, in January this year. The priority need categories show that that was the first month on record in which mental disability or illness or physical disability were more common priority reasons than pregnancy or having dependent children for people to be accepted as homeless. There were 31 households with dependent children, 11 cases of pregnancy, only one case in that month of a young person at risk, four cases in which the priority need was old age, 20 cases of physical disability or illness, 24 cases of mental disability or illness and six cases in which the family had been accepted as homeless because of domestic violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two points that the Minister should consider. One is that priority need is not a static, definable block. Needs change month on month, week on week, in individual families for a variety of reasons. It is extremely difficult for local authorities to make the priority judgments that the Government are forcing on them by requiring them to decide whom they accept as homeless families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point arises from the Minister's response. He led me to believe—I know that he will correct me if I am wrong—that there was no guarantee that, after two years, a family which a local authority had deemed to be its responsibility for two years would be housed in local authority properties. The implication was that the local authority would find houses in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Joseph Rowntree Foundation's report for March 1996 deals specifically with private rented accommodation. In the section headed "The sector's appropriateness for housing homeless people—Accessing private sector tenancies", the report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Surveys of private landlords consistently show that the types of households which they least prefer to let to are those containing children."</p></blockquote>
We have already heard from other Opposition Members graphic examples of the enormous damage done to children if they and their families are not in permanent, secure housing. Such children's school work is less satisfactory than that of their contemporaries. There is evidence of the re-emergence of childhood illnesses stemming directly from lack of proper food, because many families in bed-and-breakfast accommodation cannot cook nutritious food for their children. There is a growing body of evidence that shows that such children have difficulties forming social relationships because of the damage caused by not being in a permanent home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency I have a case of a mother with two children in a hostel and under permanent threat of eviction by the local authority that has put them within my constituency. Letters from the family's medical practitioner and from the daughter's school state that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0337">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>595</span>
enormous damage being done to her, both physically and mentally, by the anxiety of having nowhere permanent to live cannot be exaggerated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the heading "Accessing private sector tenancies", the Joseph Rowntree Foundation states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Childless couples are the most preferred by landlords…The vast majority of private landlords prefer not to let to tenants receiving housing benefit …In addition, many homeless households may experience difficulties in affording payments for rent in advance and deposits (which private landlords usually require)."</p></blockquote>
I take those findings seriously. If I understood him correctly, the Minister was leading the Committee to believe that the solution to the problem of families not being able to find permanent local authority housing was that they would be able to find housing in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even without the benefit of the findings of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, it is my experience from my constituency that it is enormously difficult for families to find decent, affordable housing in the private sector, especially because in many instances the family has small children and the parents are unemployed. All those factors impact against their finding housing in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Landlords consider not only financial certainty but, as the Minister said, social criteria. There is no doubt that many private landlords do not want to have in their properties families in which the parents are unemployed. They refuse to accept the possibility that unemployment is the fault not of the unemployed but of the employment market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government do not reconsider their proposals, there will be an increase in social breakdown and in the national health service bills that we shall have to pay, because there is growing evidence of the deterioration, both physical and mental, of those who cannot find secure accommodation. That is not the way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich said, the original Act worked. As my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish pointed out, the basic, overriding, bottom-line problem is not the people who apply for housing but die lack of housing available for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not hold it against him personally, but I must tell the Minister that his position is untenable. He is not personally to blame because he has inherited this mess and has been trying with some ingenuity to mitigate its worst effects, but he is still stuck with a scheme that is fundamentally non-operable. He is still stuck with the absurd concept of a single route into social housing. He has admitted himself that it is not going to work like that—there will be all sorts of exceptions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rather than accepting reality and recognising that rather than a single route there will have to be alternative routes—different routes appropriate for different circumstances—the Minister carries on with the absurd figment of the imagination that there can be a single route. I admire his ingenuity in trying to make a fundamentally unsound arrangement slightly less harsh and irrational, but the exercise is doomed. It cannot work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>596</span>
We are told now that some homeless people will be eligible to be rehoused directly, if they are already on the register and have—if I heard the Minister's words right—"nearly enough priority". Can I tempt the Minister to say a little more about that? I tried to intervene when he said those words, but I did not get the chance, I shall do so now. What will be "nearly enough priority"? Are we talking about people who are one point below the level at which they might have been allocated? Ten points below? Fifteen points below? Perhaps it will be a percentage—5, 10 or 15 per cent. below. How is the "nearly enough priority" to be offered accommodation to be determined?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for Denton and Reddish and for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson) spoke of the difficulty of making precise judgments. This is the judgment of Solomon. How is the judgment of latter-day Solomons—some 300-plus local authorities will have to make these decisions—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Solopersons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Solopersons, as the Minister says. How will those brilliant latter-day people be able to decide what constitutes sufficient priority? I suspect that, even if many learned treatises were written about this, we would still be no wiser. It is nonsense, and the Minister knows it. Either we decide that there will be a single route into housing and that only those who qualify can get into housing by that route—the Government's original position, which was wholly nonsensical and unsustainable but at least had the merit of consistency—or we say that that is not workable and that we must accept a pluralistic framework with a range of different routes. If we accept that—the Minister is edging his way towards it—we must concede that the basis of the Bill is unworkable and wrong and return to the framework of the 1977 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me tease the Minister a little more. What about people who are not on the register? I presume that they will not qualify in any way for direct rehousing because they will not have been in this miraculous register.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not it logical that everyone would put himself on the register—even people buying their home—in case something went wrong? A great deal of bureaucracy would accompany that and would build an unrealistic assessment of needs for local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is most perspicacious—not only is he right, he anticipated what I was about to say. The provision will merely encourage people who are not on the register to put their names on it in the hope that if ever they became homeless they would be able to argue that they had nearly enough priority to be considered for direct rehousing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If by some mischance they were not on the register, what would happen to them? What would happen if their homes were destroyed by fire or flood, or another disaster? After the recent appalling IRA bomb at Canary wharf a number of properties on the Barkingside estate in Tower Hamlets were damaged. They received little publicity—most of it was about the commercial properties that were damaged. If they had been destroyed and the tenants had been unable to live in them, would they have been told that they would not be rehoused directly because they were not on the register? Is the Minister seriously
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0338">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>597</span>
telling us that they would be told that they must go onto a waiting list before they could be assessed for permanent housing? The Minister knows that this is nonsense. He knows that there would be outrage and a public outcry if people made homeless through a terrorist atrocity were not entitled to direct rehousing because of the technicality of their names not being listed on a register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about people who have lost their homes through repossession—home owners who tried desperately to hold onto their home but were unable to do so because their income had fallen and they could not afford repayments? They might not be on a register because they had not expected, or wanted, to lose their homes. Would they be told, "No you cannot be considered. You must do your time on the register first." What about children leaving care? In the past there have been sensible arrangements for quotas, with people being nominated from social services directly into housing from a local authority or a housing association? Will we be told that that cannot operate because they were not registered on a housing waiting list? There are examples of where the application of the Minister's proposed formula would result in injustices and nosenses and create enormous resentment among people who would be told that they did not have nearly enough priority or that they should have had the foresight to put their name on the register before the disaster that led to the loss of their homes. Trying to make a bad arrangement a little less bad does not make it right. Everything that has emerged this morning has revealed just how wrong, inappropriate, chaotic and unjust is the proposed framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also said that some homeless people now spend time in temporary accommodation and that under his new arrangements there would be nothing wrong with requiring a bit of time in such accommodation. Existing legislation, reinforced by the Department of the Environment's guidelines, from which I quoted earlier, stresses that people should not be required to spend time in temporary accommodation. All the evidence of research over the years into the position of homeless families reinforces that obvious and commonsense message, which all hon. members can understand. It is a good thing to rehouse people as quickly as possible in permanent, secure accommodation so that they can put down roots, and so that their children's education is stable. The Department of the Environment endorsed that policy until the extraordinary U-turn in the Bill, which requires people to spend time in temporary accommodation as a matter of policy. That is nonsense, and the Minister knows it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he did not propose to return to the era before the 1977 Act. I am sorry that the right hon. member for City of London and Westminster South (Mr. Brooke) is not here, because he is a great historian, who takes up historical references enthusiastically. If the Minister examines the lessons of history, he will realise that the National Assistance Act 1948, which formed the statutory framework for housing before 1977, required social services departments—to which the legislation applied—to secure temporary accommodation for persons in urgent need. There is not much difference between that provision and the Government's proposal. They are the same; they provide for temporary accommodation followed by permanent accommodation through a different route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>598</span>
The fundamental change that the 1977 Act effected was breaking the emphasis on temporary accommodation, which was often squalid, dangerous, substandard and an affront to humanity. The Act created a framework in which homeless people would normally be expected to be housed in permanent accommodation. The 1977 Act's greatest contribution was bringing relief of homelessness into mainstream housing provision. The new proposals would damage that. It is not true that they would not take us back to a pre-1977 situation, because that would be their precise effect. Before 1977, homeless people could not expect permanent accommodation, only temporary accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister queried our position and asked whether we argued for the status quo, or for change. My hon. Friend the Member for Attercliffe discussed possible changes. The framework that the 1977 Act established is right. To that extent, we support the status quo. But we do not believe that there should be no change. There is a case for remedying the ambiguity that the Awua judgment brought to the interpretation of the Act. The Minister's predecessor realised the need for action after the Pulhoffer judgment had raised doubts about local authorities' obligations under the 1977 Act. The other place prompted him, and pushed matters along, nevertheless he agreed that amendments to the legislation, to clarify the duties of local authorities were right, and they were incorporated in the Act. A similar arrangement should be made now, to tackle the uncertainty that the Awua judgment created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other changes might take account of the categories of people in housing need, for example, the young, single homeless, who have a very raw deal. Perhaps we should be more precise about the circumstances in which they would qualify for priority housing. We would be happy to consider constructive changes, which would improve the working of the legislation. However, the fundamental principle of the 1977 Act is sound and right, whereas the Government's proposals are dangerous and damaging, and must be opposed. Although it would not be right to press the amendments to a Division, as they are technical and concern the definition and concept of housing need, we shall seek the support of all Committee members who believe that society has a responsibility to ensure a proper, coherent and effective framework for the relief of homelessness. We shall urge them to vote with us in subsequent Divisions, in which we shall challenge the fundamentally unsound, dangerous and damaging Government proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Greenwich intends to withdraw the amendment. As he said, we shall focus on aspects of what we have been discussing as we proceed, and we shall return to many of the points that have been raised, so I hope that the Committee will forgive me if I do not give an encyclopedic response. I am conscious that the hon. Gentleman wants us to clear up the group of amendments
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0339">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>599</span>
by one o'clock, so that we can discuss other matters this afternoon, so I will mention only a limited number of the points raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked what had happened since the 1980s. The Department commissioned research, which was called "Routes into Local Authority Housing"—the hon. Gentleman will be familiar with that, as he is an assiduous reader of research documents. There are unequal means of access to social housing. People rehoused form the waiting list share characteristics—income, employment, status and previous tenure—with homeless applicants, but homeless households receive statutory priority over waiting-list applicants in the allocation of social housing. That is how the system works presently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall flesh out divisions between Labour and Conservative Members during our proceedings, but there is a fundamental difference between us. I do not believe that it is nonsensical that people should be placed in accommodation that is not permanent while their underlying needs are assessed. That is one of the matters at the heart of the Bill. We shall spell out circumstances in which that might not apply, but what is important is that we set out criteria through which those needs can be assessed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept what was said by the hon. Members for Denton and Reddish and for Hampstead and Highgate about the difficulties of making judgments and the wisdom of Solomon, but the duty to try is inescapable—local authorities and housing associations cannot avoid it. There is already an assessment of need under current homelessness legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister not accept that there is a fundamental difference between current legislation and his proposals? Temporary accommodation is sometimes used while an assessment is carried out—in Sheffield, for a period of four to six weeks. Under the Government's proposals, however, the interim accommodation would fulfil that requirement, but there could be a period of up to a further two years during which families are in temporary accommodation, because permanent accommodation is not made available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point I was making concerned the difficulties, which we all accept, of assessing need. That assessment already has to be made, as not all those who present themselves as homeless are accepted as homeless—there has to be a process of analysis. We are proposing to introduce criteria that are more sophisticated and which we hope will be a more effective analytical tool. Some of the current criteria reflect the physical characteristics of housing—that goes back for more than a generation—and we all accept that we should introduce an element of social need, which flows from what has happened in society. Whether we like it or not, we must find a way to identify and deal with those needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that I do not think that I have ever used expressions such as queue-jumping or introduced elements of morality. I am concerned with finding out where needs exist, and with trying to satisfy those needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>600</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the problem is not assessing need but prioritising need, as the Minister would like local authorities to do, between cases that could be entirely equivalent. It might not be possible to accord even a millimetre of a point between cases under the present system. That is where the system breaks down. Some people will undoubtedly feel that they have been unfairly treated if someone else in the same situation is found a home but they are not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, that happens now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish said that I might not see so many cases of homelessness in my constituency surgery as he did in his. That may be true because of the different characteristics of our constituencies, but I see a significant number of housing cases in all my surgeries. All hon. Members must have heard constituents argue that suitable houses were available but that "someone else always seems to get it". It is a question of allocation. I accept what the hon. Gentleman said. I think I can say that we shall reply to the Select Committee on the Environment which is chaired by the hon. Gentleman, within the time allowed. Obviously, one can always argue about how to supply housing needs. We shall always have to decide how housing is allocated. The heart of the Bill is about making that allocation. We shall come back to that question later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several Opposition Members have mentioned allocations with reference to sink estates. The problem also exists there. I have visited estates that were the subject of estate action programmes, where properties have been renovated but where some of the original tenants did not want to move back into refurbished buildings because they thought that it would not work out for them. In such cases we have made arrangements with local authorities that homeless people should have access to a significant proportion of that housing. Some traditional tenants reacted adversely to that when they saw that their old estate was beginning to work as a community; there was almost a sense of resentment, because they now wanted to return.

One of the important benefits of the Bill—I accept that it is a small benefit—is that we will allow local authorities to use allocations more creatively, to build mixed communities rather than simply taking names from the top of the list. We are trying to meet the Rowntree bundle of concerns, referred to by the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate, by making such communities work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister concludes his remarks, will he say how he intends informing us of the results of that consultation paper on allocation, so that we can debate it on Report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have written to all members of the Committee, but I shall spell it out again. I believe that the consultation ends on 26 March. We have spelled out most criteria for the consultation. Most people feel that the framework is about right, but that it might need some amendment or fine tuning. I will bring back the amendments that flow from that consultation on Report. I have to respect the consultation period, but I shall use my best possible endeavours to do so as early as possible, so that there is plenty of time to analyse the proposals.
