	<p>	<i>Amendments made:</i> No. 583, in page 84, line 24, leave out "perform any such duty" and insert "discharge such functions".</p>
	<p>No. 584, in page 84, line 45, leave out from "not" to end of line 2 on page 85 and insert

	<p>No. 585, in page 85, line 3, leave out from "person" to end of line 4 and insert

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Diana Maddock 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 540, in page 85, line 5, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"reasonable charges as they may determine"</p></blockquote>
and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"charges as are reasonable with regard to the means of the person".</p></blockquote>
The amendment is important because it would place a specific duty on a local authority to have regard to an applicant's means when determining reasonable charges for accommodation secured for occupation by that applicant. There is a lack of clarity in the Bill about whether the local housing market or the financial means of the applicant should determine whether charges are reasonable. It is right that the rent on any accommodation that is found should be affordable and within the reach of households on low incomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that high accommodation charges sometimes force people to leave paid work so that they will qualify for housing benefit. It is in everyone's interest to ensure that, where possible, people can afford their accommodation without being forced to give up work in order to meet their housing costs. It is therefore important that the issue is clarified in the Bill. Accommodation in the private sector is often considerably more expensive than that in the public sector. The average local authority rent is currently £38.29, whereas the average private sector rent is £60.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will be happy to clarify that issue. I look forward to hearing his comments. The Government have expressed concern about the housing benefit bill—this is one way in which they can try to keep it down. We must make it clear that people should not be pushed into accommodation that they cannot afford. Even if they occupy that accommodation for a short period, a short let on a high rent can play havoc with a family's finances. I hope that the Minister will look favourably on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration (Mr. David Curry)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I can give the hon. Lady the reassurance that she seeks. The amendment is unnecessary because, by definition, a charge is unreasonable if the applicant is unable to afford it. Clause 161(6), which the amendment would change, is essentially a restatement of section 69(2) of the Housing Act 1985. In respect of that section, the code of guidance makes it clear that in setting charges, authorities must take account not only of the level of housing benefit available, but of other charges such as heating or the cost of eating out where cooking facilities are limited. The code also makes it clear that charges should never exceed the cost incurred by the authority. I hope that the hon. Lady will consider that to be sufficient reassurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's assurances. It was important to air the issue. It will be important when people go to local authorities after the Bill is enacted and implemented. In view of the Minister's

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 527, in page 85, line 14, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and to the personal circumstances of the applicant and of any other person that might reasonably be expected to reside with him.".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 562, in page 85, line 14, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) In determining whether a property is suitable for a person the local authority shall—
	<ol>
	<li>undertake an assessment of the housing needs of any person in priority need who is not intentionally homeless;</li>
	<li>where this assessment identifies that the person or a member of their household is disabled and has specific housing needs relating to his disability or physical accessibility of either the property or the location in which it is situated, undertake a full meaningful individual assessment of the person's housing requirements;</li></ol></p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The full assessment shall also be undertaken if a person has support or care needs or would have difficulty independently securing his own accommodation.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 494 is designed to help to rectify a weakness in the drafting of the Bill. Clause 162 sets out certain factors that a local authority must take into account when deciding whether accommodation is suitable for a homeless family. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the local housing authority shall have regard to Parts IX, X and XI of the Housing Act 1985"—</p></blockquote>
which relate to
	<br><blockquote><p>"slum clearance; overcrowding; houses in multiple occupation".</p></blockquote>
That is reasonable as far as it goes. Clearly a local authority does not want to put homeless people into accommodation which has been defined as suitable for slum clearance; nor does it want to put people into accommodation which is overcrowded or subject to control orders because of multiple occupation. However, if the Government want to ensure that the local authority takes account of all the relevant duties relating to the condition of property—I assume that they do—they must also have regard to parts VI and XVIII of the Housing Act 1985 because those parts also contain relevant powers relating to the condition of properties. Part VI deals with accommodation which is either unfit or
	<br><blockquote><p>"in such a state of disrepair that … substantial repairs are necessary".</p></blockquote>
It is, therefore, analogous to part IX, which relates specifically to slum clearance. It is simply a different approach. Rather than clearing the property under part VI, it is a question of serving repair notices to improve the property. Clearly it would be inappropriate for
	<span class='label label-info column'>832</span>
homeless households to be put into accommodation for which the local authority is either about to or has already served notices to effect repairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, part XVIII contains general powers relating to unfitness and poor conditions. The purpose of amendment No. 494, therefore, is to ensure that the local authority, in taking account of the relevant parts of the 1985 Act, should take account of all the relevant parts of the 1985 Act in relation to the condition of property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 527 is different, but similarly meritorious, it would require the local authority to take account of the personal circumstances of the applicant and other people who might reasonably be expected to reside with the applicant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 562, tabled by the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock), goes a little further and specifically covers the circumstances of homeless households that suffer from disabilities. We support that amendment, but as I tabled amendment No. 527, I shall restrict my comments to saying that the principle that the applicant's circumstances should be taken into account by the local authority when deciding on the suitability of accommodation is obvious and, I believe, non-contentious. I hope that the Minister's response will be more favourable than to some of our earlier amendments today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to speak to amendment No. 562. The hon. Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford) referred to the necessity of assessing the individual needs of applicants. The purpose of the amendment is to deal with the needs of people who are disabled. It is in line with amendments that were moved this morning and I hope that the Minister will respond in a similar vein to that in which he responded this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned that disabled people should get a fair crack of the whip. There has been evidence in the past from groups representing disabled people, which have discovered that local authority practice is not always good in this area. In 1992, for example, the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation carried out a survey which showed that many local authorities relied on transfer and waiting lists to alert them to the needs of disabled people and that comprehensive records were not kept. Shelter has also carried out surveys, the last one being in 1990. It found that local authorities had limited awareness of the number of disabled people who were on their lists and that their allocations procedures were rarely designed to identify disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a tendency to lump all disabled people together and to try to provide facilities for them as a group. When dealing with the housing needs of people who suffer from disability it is vital to consider each person's needs. Even if the Minister is not minded to accept the amendment as it is drafted, I hope that he will ensure, in his guidance notes and advice on best practice, that local authorities will be required to assess the individual who has disabilities rather than to treat disabled people in a general way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is plenty of support for that approach. I hope
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0474">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>833</span>
that the Minister will take advantage of the opportunity that the Bill offers us to improve previous practices in relation to the special needs of disabled people. That is especially important in view of the proposed changes in local authorities' responsibilities for homeless people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the hon. Lady's amendment first, and in exactly the same way as I dealt with her analogous amendment earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consideration that she discussed is within the definition of suitability. The courts have already established that an authority should take an overall view of an applicant's needs, including any medical considerations. If there is a shortcoming in existing practices, I should certainly be willing to reinforce the relevant guidance. I believe that the hon. Lady was seeking such a commitment—she discussed practice, which in effect, is what is translated through the guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Greenwich introduced amendment No. 494 by saying that he wanted to be helpful—a wise Minister always adopts a note of caution in response to such a remark. The parts of the 1985 Act to which the hon. Gentleman referred are, in a sense, free-standing: they do not relate specifically to home-lessness. I shall discuss whether, and in what way, the substance of his remarks might be relevant to any proposals that we may introduce that relate specifically to homelessness. The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that I can give no commitments other than to examine the substance of his comments and to compare the parts of the 1985 Act that he mentioned with our present proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister when he has finished his scrutiny of parts VI and XVIII of the 1985 Act to establish whether there are any hidden or nefarious intentions behind the amendment, he will find that our original purpose was entirely justified. The parts of the 1985 Act that are listed in the amendment and the parts of that Act that are listed in the clause relate in the same way to local authorities' powers over properties that are in a poor condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that the Minister is prepared to consider the matter, and I hope that the result will be an improvement in the Bill. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 528, in page 85, line 14, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) Accommodation is not suitable unless it is at a rent which the applicant can afford, either from his own resources or with the benefit of such public assistance as is likely to be available to him.".</p></blockquote>
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich, I want to be helpful to the Minister, and I hope that I shall receive an equally helpful response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is pretty obvious that it is not suitable for a person or family to reside in accommodation that is not affordable by that individual or family. That obvious point should be written into the Bill. Local authorities should not be permitted to fulfil their duties under, for example, clause 155, by referring individuals to properties that they cannot afford. It would be most unfair and
	<span class='label label-info column'>834</span>
improper if people who were homeless and in desperate circumstances were sent off to look at properties that were much more expensive than they could afford from the income allowed to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a particular problem in the private sector where average rents are about £60 per week, according to my latest information, compared with just under £40 a week in the local authority sector. So when we talk about suitable accommodation in the private sector, it is relevant and correct that reference should be made to affordability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is case law on the subject of what is suitable accommodation, which refers to its affordability. In the case of R 	<i>v.</i> Tower Hamlets LBC ex parte Kaur in 1994, the court held that accommodation was not suitable unless it was at a rent that the applicant could afford either from his own resources or with the benefit of such public assistance as was likely to be available to him. Hence the particular words used in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Awua judgment, reference was also made to the fact that other matters, such as whether the occupant could afford the rent, may also be material. So there is case law on the subject, but the case law refers to previous legislation, and case law changes from time to time as the courts take a different view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, to be assured that accommodation must be affordable to be considered suitable, it would assist if the wording that we have suggested—or something similar, if the Minister can produce a better draft—appeared in the legislation. Then local authorities would have proper regard to that and especially to the reference to benefits that may be available from public assistance. We must bear in mind the fact that, because of the situation with local reference rents and the recent change in the benefits regime, it is possible that someone entitled to full housing benefit could afford rent but that, if the rent were higher than the local reference rent, there might be a significant gap between the rent payable and the benefit due to an individual, with the result that the property would not be affordable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister can be equally helpful on this occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been so helpful that he has not merely moved the amendment but has given the substance of my response as well. We touched on this issue when we discussed amendment No. 479 and, as the hon. Gentleman said, quite rightly, there is case law on the subject. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we shall, if necessary, use the order-making power in clause 162 to put it beyond doubt that accommodation that the applicant cannot afford-taking into account any housing benefit to which he is entitled—is not to be regarded as suitable. I hope that that will give the hon. Gentleman the satisfaction that he requires and that he will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hope that the Minister will be as helpful with regard to this amendment as he was with regard to the previous one. I do not see how the words of this amendment can be incorporated into the code of guidance; they should be in the Bill. The amendment raises a reasonable point because the Bill acknowledges that, in some cases, the authority may help people by storing furniture. If people are moving between authorities, back to the place where they have a local connection, it may be much more satisfactory for all concerned if, instead of storing their furniture, the authority has the power to transport it. That need not be more costly for the authority—indeed, it could prove cheaper. The amendment would give the authority a discretionary power. Subsection (4) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The authority may for the purposes of this section" do certain things. We propose to add a discretionary power to allow authorities to transport furniture and deal with an individual's problems rather than having the responsibility merely for storing furniture. Our simple and reasonable request is that the Minister should consider letting the authority offer help in that way rather than only in the way specified in the Bill.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wished to hear the hon. Gentleman's case before I decided my response. I sympathise with what he said, but I wanted to be sure that he appreciated the need to define carefully what one was asking local authorities to do or not to do. For example, if an applicant had the right to decide where personal property should be stored, how could the authority ensure that it was properly looked after? How could it ensure that its duty to protect property from loss or damage would be met if it was not responsible for where it was stored? A series of issues need to be addressed and, if the hon. Gentleman will permit me, I shall take the matter away and see whether I can come up with a form of drafting to give him the substance that he required while ensuring that the local authority is not left with an undefinable liability which would be difficult to discharge. That would be the sensible way forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that response and, with that assurance, I intend to withdraw the amendment. I believe that the amendment to subsection (4) would not impose obligations on the authority but simply allow it to undertake transportation of furniture and other property as appropriate. I accept that the authority would have to consider the security of property, but it will have to do that in order to store property as stipulated in subsection (4)(b). The problems mentioned by the Minister are no different from those raised by the Bill as it stands. However, as I accept the Minister's assurance that he will come back with a form of words that will suit the Committee, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendments tabled by my hon. Friends is to ensure that social services and local housing authorities, housing associations and, in some instances, voluntary organisations work in what has been referred to as a seamless way in providing proper, adequate housing resources for some of the most vulnerable people in our society—namely those who suffer from mental and physical disabilities; young people; and children. The National Association for Mental Health, which supports the amendment, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Good community care for people with mental health problems consists of a wide range of services including social support, opportunities for work or other stimulus, someone to talk to, practical help—and decent housing."</p></blockquote>
None of us could argue with that assessment of the most basic needs of people who are vulnerable either as a result of mental or physical disabilities or, in the case of children and young people, as a result of the breakdown of families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have issued guidance on the provision of community-based services. As we know, care in the community came into being to do precisely that—to enable those who have only known life in those vast Victorian institutions, totally cut off from any kind of human exchange and with no sense of participating in society, to return to the community. It is a responsibility of all of us in the community to participate in that. Nowhere is that more clearly demonstrated than in meeting the needs of such essentially vulnerable people in local authority housing and social services departments within local authorities.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although guidance has been issued by the Government on the provision of community-based services, there is no duty on local housing authorities to communicate the concerns that have been expressed to them by the social services department in their area. The purpose of the amendments is therefore to ensure that local housing authorities, housing associations and voluntary groups would have a statutory obligation to exercise that duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to a briefing from MIND. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) who forwarded to me a letter from an organisation in his constituency—the Trafford User Group. The vice-chairman of that group, Mr. Charlie Donegan, feels that the Bill has a grievous impact on some of the most vulnerable in our society and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is essential for people who suffer from mental ill health,"</p></blockquote>
—this could be extended to those who suffer from physical disabilities and to young people—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to have a secure tenancy, not to be settled temporarily, only to be uprooted 12 months later… A society that does not look after the housing needs of such a vulnerable section of its community, cannot call itself civilised."</p></blockquote>
I entirely endorse that assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also received a briefing from umbrella group, the Housing Bill Disability Group, which is concerned with some of the most vulnerable in our society, who suffer from mental or physical disabilities. It comprises the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation, the Royal National Institute for the Blind, Scope, Age Concern England, Aids and Housing project, the National Wheelchair Housing Association Group, the National Disabled Persons Housing Service. The briefing, which endorses what these amendments seek to achieve, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Appropriate housing is a vital component of community care policy. Disabled people with care and support needs cannot live independently in the community of they have inappropriate housing. Placing a duty on a housing authority to consult with social services on the best way to address the housing needs of a disabled or vulnerable person in need of support will assist in ensuring that housing and support needs are addressed in a co-ordinated way."</p></blockquote>
Research was carried out by the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. Its report "Crime and Harassment 1993" reveals that certain types of temporary housing such as hostels, bedsits and bed and breakfast accommodation can make disabled residents vulnerable to harassment or crime, due in many instances to the lack of physical security. I have a constituent who suffers from a recurring mental disability and is also physically frail. He has on occasion been the butt of certain criminal elements within his community which causes him great distress. The security of his residence could certainly be improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that like me, other members of the Committee, will have received evidence on this issue from a variety of organisations. The National Housing Forum said that complementary support is needed, not least because of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1993 and the Children Act 1989. The National Housing Forum states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Government guidance on the housing aspect of community care and the Children Act emphasises the need to co-ordinate the requirements of the different legislation into a seamless service."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>838</span>
It is central to the purpose of the amendments that there should be a seamless service. The Bill will not make it easier for local authority housing departments to meet the needs even of those who are not vulnerable. There must be something in the Bill to assist social services departments to, as it were, go to the head of the local housing authority's queue and insist on a proper assessment of the type of housing to be allocated by the local authority to people who are especially vulnerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The citizens advice bureaux support the amendments, as does CHAR—the housing campaign for single people—which states in its briefing on new clause 36, on the subject of children and young people:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Children Act was introduced in 1992 with a remit to provide for homeless 16 and 17-year-olds who were deemed to be "in need" by their social services department." CHAR discovered, however</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"that 25 per cent, of local authorities did not have a policy to assess all homeless 16 and 17-year-olds and 41 per cent, of authorities did not consider rooflessness as grounds for accommodation".</p></blockquote>
I would regard rooflessness as a ground for accommodation, especially when so many young people of 16, 17 or younger whom I have met in my local authority area have been thrown out of their family home. That is not an isolated occurrence; many have disagreements with their family and run away to avoid sexual or physical abuse. Those young people are especially vulnerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that the purpose of the amendments is to ensure that there is a seamless service between social services and housing authorities, as the National Housing Forum urged. There must be a genuine examination of people's needs and a real attempt to meet them. Some people require all possible assistance for only a short time. Others, who have physical and mental disabilities, need continuing assistance. I am chary of suggesting that I am being helpful to the Minister, as he clearly bites the helpful hand that attempts to feed him, and I would not go so far as to say that I wish to be obstructive, but I hope that he will look kindly on the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to new clause 34, which is not dissimilar to new clause 36 and would place a duty on local authority departments to respond positively to requests from social services departments for accommodation for young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would strengthen the protection offered to children in section 27 of the Children Act 1989, because it would ensure that local housing departments complied with requests from social services departments for secure accommodation for a child or young person. Section 20 of the Act states that every local authority should provide accommodation for children and young people in specified categories of need. Section 27 clearly expresses Parliament's intention that all relevant local authorities should co-operate in ensuring provision of such accommodation. The amendment would include that intention in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know of circumstances which the required co-operation does not occur. A recent Department of Health research study found that housing departments did not always take account of the housing needs of care leavers, even when local social services departments had made representations. That is not to say that good practice does not exist in many departments, especially
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0477">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>839</span>
social service departments, throughout the country. It is important that their work is backed up by the provision of good accommodation, so that they can continue to support young people
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many social services departments do good work in preparing young people for successful, independent living. That work can be undone if accommodation needs are not fulfilled. The new clause is clear; it complements the Children Act 1989. We have tried to ensure that the Bill will work in conjunction with that Act. There have been problems with implementing that legislation; it contained wonderful intentions, but other measures have not been in tune with it. The new clause would ensure that the Bill was in tune with the Children Act 1989.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Hamp-stead and Highgate (Ms Jackson) accepts that if I decide to bite the proffered hand, I can do that more effectively than hitherto.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not very nice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, the hon. Lady said that I had snapped or bitten when I believed that I had been genuinely helpful. But I am willing to accept that I misinterpreted her sentiments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several amendments have been intended to ensure that people with particular disadvantages are properly cared for. In the past, we have agreed that sensible practice is important, especially when the duty covers more than one statutory provider. The Bill should be coherent. The principle that we outlined when we discussed related matters earlier in our proceedings should apply throughout the Bill. As the hon. Member for Christchurch suspected, the argument for accepting the amendment is weak, but that for ensuring that statutory providers and local authorities are conscious of the importance of the matter is very strong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clauses 34 and 36 are almost identical—they obviously came from the same organisation. They are unnecessary because they repeat provisions that are already contained in section 27 of the Children Act 1989, which is binding on local housing authorities. We would not add to the force of those provisions by repeating them in the Bill. The current code of guidance dates from 1991, before care in the community took full effect. When we revise the code, it will need to reflect authorities' new responsibilities to co-operate. I undertake to spell that out clearly. In that light, I hope that the hon. Lady will accept that the better place for that is in guidance and that it will figure clearly there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must admit that I am not absolutely clear what the Minister meant in his opening remarks and whether he was accusing me of implying that he no longer had the use of his own teeth or whether his sense of humour was simply less sharp than we have had the privilege of knowing it to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has given a clear, open commitment that guidance will include, if not an absolute duty, at least an emphasis on the additional responsibilities being placed on housing authorities and social services.
	<span class='label label-info column'>840</span>
That will include not only responsibilities under existing Acts, but changes that the Government are introducing to housing benefits—for example, for asylum seekers—and changes in the Bill that will have a serious impact on homeless people who are seeking accommodation. Given that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because we have already covered the issues on which the amendments focus in a debate concerned with local authority allocation policies. They relate to local authority responsibilities for the homeless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One issue needs to be highlighted. There is a case for ensuring the consistency of approach that the Minister talked about when he responded to my hon. Friend the Member for Attercliffe. The amendments are about offences committed by applicants who either give incorrect information or fail to give information that they are reasonably requested to give.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seek to provide mitigating circumstances when applicants have a reasonable excuse for making a false statement or for failing to give information. We have described circumstances in which people who have gone through an extremely unpleasant experience—perhaps child abuse or a painful domestic conflict and separation—do not feel able to talk freely about it, or give a different impression behind their route into homelessness. The whole Committee would feel that people in such circumstances deserve to be treated reasonably sympathetically and should not be automatically concluded to be guilty of an offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our second aim is to seek to reduce the fine to which people in that position would be liable. The Bill, as drafted, contains a curious issue, to which I shall return. The penalty is a fine up to level 5. We have talked about proportionality and we shall shortly come to the leasehold clauses. The penalties for a landlord who wilfully denies to leasehold tenants the opportunity to buy the property as and when the freeholder decides to sell is one issue that we shall focus on. Under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987, first refusal should be granted to the leaseholder. Sadly, as we have discovered in recent months, several large, wealthy landowners have ignored those provisions, with total impunity; there are no penalties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have recognised that that is an injustice and are bringing forward amendments that will create a penalty. But the scale penalty that they are proposing for landlords who will, in many cases, be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0478">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>841</span>
hugely wealthy organisations that have acted in a way that has caused a serious injustice to many hundreds or, in some cases, thousands of people, will be a fine not exceeding level 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is clearly no proportionality if hapless homeless people, who, when making desperate applications for accommodation fail to give information that they have been asked for, are subject to an offence and can be fined up to level 5, while a large landlord who wilfully flouts the law can be fined only up to level 4. Anyone with a sense of justice must consider that to be outrageous. We have discussed the matter before and, now that we have had a chance to see the Government's further amendments, I hope that the Minister will realise that there is no consistency in the Bill if one is subject to a fine of a higher magnitude that the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one other curious issue in relation to the level of fine. With one exception, the provisions in clause 165 are almost verbatim to those in part III of the Housing Act 1985 which, in turn, were the same as those in the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977. The exception is that the level of the fine has been increased. The Government are not simply carrying across previous legislation. If the Minister refers back to part III of the Housing Act 1985, he will see that the fine was put at level 4. There has been a deliberate decision to increase the fine for homeless people making applications. That is wrong, especially when the Government are proposing to set a lower fine for people who are guilty of far greater offences that cause far more serious damage to a much larger number of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will give a helpful response to the issue; he gave a reasonably helpful response last time and said that he would reconsider the matter. Given that I have now cited more evidence of the need to change the provision, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will give an even more helpful response and agree that, first, there should be a provision for mitigating circumstances and, secondly, that the proportionality issue argues for a lesser penalty than level 5.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issues raised by amendments Nos. 597 and 598 are effectively the same as those raised by amendments Nos. 424 and 425. I said that I would consider those amendments and I have, indeed, had some further thought. However, that was provisional because I wanted to hear the points that would be made in this debate. It is not appropriate to provide that people can have a reasonable excuse for knowingly or recklessly making a false statement or withholding information in circumstances that may result in their obtaining public assistance to which they are not entitled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the level of the fines, I remember what the hon. Gentleman said in our previous debate and I am anxious that there should be coherence under the Bill in that respect. Clearly, I have in mind what I said when we discussed allocations. I am willing to consult colleagues about the level of fines in the light of the general level of fine that applies throughout several areas of public policy and return to the Committe with a suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I return to a matter that is central to our discussions on provision for the homeless people, which is the housing of people who are owed responsibilities by local authorities under the legislation. As has been made clear on a number of occasions, it is possible for local authorities to discharge their responsibilities in several ways. Under existing legislation, they can provide accommodation from their own housing stock, they can seek the help of housing associations or they can give assistance to people to find accommodation in the private sector. The Government intend to change that by making it impossible for homeless people to be housed directly—we have already debated some of the nonsenses that will flow from that.

We now come to one of the most nonsensical arrangements of all. Under the provisions in lines 31 to 38 of schedule 10—which relate to a local authority seeking the co-operation of a housing association to provide accommodation to homeless people—the housing association will be debarred from providing those people with an assured tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is purely a result of the Government's ideoligical obsession with the single route into local housing. Housing associations are independent bodies, and have rightly felt extremely concerned about the extent to which their independence is being increasingly eroded by the Government on many issues, such as their entitlement to house refugees—that has, in recent weeks, been a matter of anger and concern to many associations. They are now confronted with the prospect that it will be unlawful for them to provide an assured tenancy to a homeless applicant who is referred to them by the local authority, unless that person has
	<span class='label label-info column'>844</span>
spent a period in temporary accommodation and has then satisfied waiting-list criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens when the local authority, seeks the co-operation of the housing association to house the homeless applicant immediately—in other words, to provide temporary accommodation while applicants serve their time on the waiting list? Perhaps the Minister believes that the housing association could offer an insecure tenancy—a shorthold tenancy—but the association cannot even do that, because the legal definition of assured tenancies covers shorthold tenancies as well. The housing association will not be able to offer either assured tenancy or an assured shorthold tenancy. It will have to say that it cannot offer anything, as it is not prepared to let property that way, or it will have to accommodate the unfortunate homeless family into a licensed arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It cannot make any sense to enforce such absurd arrangements—housing homeless families under licence—because of the ideological obsession with the single route into local authority or social housing, but that is the effect of what the Government are doing. There could not be a clearer illustration of the nonsenses that they have created through the way in which they have framed the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing associations are rightly indignant about that, for the two grounds that I have spelt out: first, because they will not be able to do their job and provide good-quality accommodation for people in need; secondly, because their independence is once again eroded by a Government who are treating them simply as a creature of Government rather than as independent and, in many cases, charitable bodies, which should be allowed to take their own decisions on many matters, such as those we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister will recognise that the provision is completely nonsensical, and that he will accept amendment No. 532, which would delete that inappropriate and regrettable provision under the schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As drafted, the provision would mean that, where a registered housing authority—or housing company, as will come into existence—offers to provide housing for a person in discharge of the homelessness legislation, the tenancy will not be assured. We intend that if that landlord subsequently wished to offer the tenant an assured tenancy of that or another property—for example, where the tenant was subsequently nominated to the landlord as having gained sufficient priority in the allocation scheme—he would do so by ending the tenancy offered in support of the homelessness duty, and by offering a new assured tenancy with its full rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision also ensures that, where accommodation offered by a registered social landlord is needed for only a short period—for example, because the authority can offer a permanent tenancy within its own stock within, say, three months—the six-month minimum period of security associated with assured tenancies, and obligations to pay the rent for that period, would not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision would also apply to tenancies offered by private landlords in support of the homelessness
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0480">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>845</span>
duty. That might happen when a landlord offers a tenancy with the financial assistance of the local authority over and above what might be covered with housing benefit—for example, through rent guarantees. If the landlord wishes to continue to offer that person accommodation on a continuing basis, we intend that it should be open to him to end the tenancy offered under the homelessness duty and to grant a new assured tenancy on the property, unfettered by the restrictions set out in the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are aware that there are other ways of meeting that objective, and I have taken note of the point made by the hon. Gentleman. We will, in any event, reconsider the drafting of the provision, not least to put it beyond doubt that the provision does not apply in cases where accommodation is secured with the assistance of the authority under the alternative accommodation provisions of clause 155. I shall table a reformulated provision at a later stage. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to hear that the provision will be reformulated. The concept of making people go through the hoop of an insecure tenancy simply because they are homeless, and possibly qualifying after a period of time to have it converted into a secure tenancy, is complete nonsense. It is a replication of the absurdities that we discussed this morning when considering the position of those who are housed temporarily in local authority accommodation. I regret that we got into that mess, but I am please that the Minister recognises that it is a mess. I hope that the reformulation will meet some of our concerns. With that in mind, I beg to ask leave to withdrawn the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>DUTY OF MAKING ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE TO NON-PRIORITY GROUPS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>",—(1) Every local housing authority shall maintain a register of landlords in their area who have accommodation available for letting and who satisfy the following conditions—
	<ol>
	<li>they are not a registered social landlord;</li>
	<li>they have satisfied the authority that they are a suitable person or body to be included in the register having regard to

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would make advice and assistance available to homeless people by placing a duty on local housing authorities to maintain a register of landlords in their areas who have accommodation available for letting and who satisfy certain conditions. That will test the Government's seriousness and commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is entirely consistent with clauses 139 and 140, which have already been agreed to, allowing local authorities to give advice to homeless people via their own agencies or through voluntary groups or other independent advisers. It will give confidence to all involved. Good landlords will accept that their duties are clear, and tenants will be protected. The difference between us and the Government on the matter of homelessness is extensive, as my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich explained at the outset of our debates on part VII. The Government have given us no evidence on why the 1977 Act should be altered—in our view, to the detriment of homeless people. We must ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place, as was made clear by many of the 10,000 people who expressed objections when the Bill was at its consultation stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were originally 44 clauses in part VII, and in effect 25 per cent, of the Bill related to arrangements affecting homeless people. That would create the conditions for confusion on the part of housing providers, whether local housing authorities, housing associations or the private rented sector, with regard to interpretation and application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause makes clear what is expected and removes the onus from homeless people. It states that the local housing authority "shall maintain a register" of landlords who satisfy reasonable conditions. Landlords must be
	<br><blockquote><p>"a suitable person or body to be included in the register".</p></blockquote>
The accommodation must be "free from disrepair" and should be
	<br><blockquote><p>"provided at rent levels, and on conditions … which are in the opinion of the authority, reasonable".</p></blockquote>
It is vital that the accommodation should be "reasonably safe and secure". We have heard numerous tales of horrendous conditions in the private rented sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause goes on to state that the names and addresses of landlords should be available, and that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0481">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>847</span>
there should be ample opportunity for inspection. Finally, it calls for a review every 12 months by the local housing authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with vulnerable people in vulnerable situations. As my hon. Friend the Member for Norman-ton (Mr. O'Brien) said this morning in relation to an earlier clause, homeless people cannot be expected to search for that information. Local authorities will have to keep adequate information if every opportunity is to be taken to provide accommodation for homeless people, as the Minister intends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will not argue against the new clause on the ground of cost or over-regulation. A refusal to accept the spirit of the new clause will confirm that the Government are not preparing to look after vulnerable homeless people as envisaged by the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977. The new clause is clear and I hope that the Minister will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New clause 37 would add to the duties and, inevitably, the cost burdens of local authorities by imposing a statutory requirement on all local authorities to maintain and review a list of landlords in their area with accommodation to let, regardless of existing arrangements or the demand for privately let accommodation in their area. It would impose on local authorities a formal system of vetting landlords and their properties, which would, of necessity, require constant updating, with associated costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 139 makes it clear that advice and assistance about preventing and resolving homelessness issues should be available to everyone. It will be for the local authority to decide how best to meet that duty. In some areas it will be sensible for the local authority or its agents to keep a list of landlords or letting agencies, but that will be a matter of good practice for the authority to decide, based on its knowledge of the area and housing stock. I would not want to prescribe that an authority must keep such a register of landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many local authorities already provide, directly or through their housing advice agencies, advice to tenants about landlords in their area who have property to let. Some authorities, such as Derby city council, have established self-regulating landlord accreditation schemes. The lady who is one of the leading lights of the Chartered Institute of Housing may have been the person who instituted such useful innovations. Other authorities have established links with reputable letting agents in their area and refer tenants directly to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many authorities are taking action to develop closer links with landlords in their area to improve the supply and quality of private rented accommodation. Landlords' forums and good landlord guides are helping local authorities to understand the concerns and aspirations of local landlords, and helping landlords to understand their duties and responsibilities. In all cases, local authorities are free to tailor their arrangements to meet the particular needs of their area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the concern about accommodation standards. However, local authorities have wide-ranging powers to ensure that private rented accommodation meets fitness and safety standards. Where standards need to be improved, our proposals in clauses 62 to 66 of
	<span class='label label-info column'>848</span>
the Bill will substantially strengthen local authorities' powers to enforce fitness and safety standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities should have the discretion to tailor their arrangements to meet local needs. We will issue guidance about how best to meet local needs for advice and assistance to prevent and resolve homelessness issues. New clause 37 would reduce that discretion. I therefore cannot commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Today we have seen the Minister facing both ways. This morning, when I questioned him about maintaining registers, he said that "they" should be able to give out information, that reasonable alternative accommodation should be available to homeless people and that local authorities should refer homeless people to that alternative accommodation. When I asked who would be responsible for advising homeless people and maintaining the registers, he said that the Opposition had a further proposal—new clause 37—in which we asked for a register, and which would allow us to debate the matter. This morning, the Minister implied that he supported the principle of a register; yet, when it comes to it, he said that he cannot support new clause 37.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What must we do to make the Minister realise that he is on the wrong track? The Minister is misleading himself and the Commitee by opposing new clause 37. This morning I asked the Minister how homeless people are to find out whether accommodation is available when it might be miles away from them. I used my constituency as an example. I represent two towns that are 17 miles apart, yet the Minister says that it is up to homeless people to find out whether there is alternative accommodation or that "they" should be able to tell homeless people whether any other reasonable accommodation is available. This morning the Minister did not tell us who "they" were. He is now saying that local authorities will give advice, but that local authorities will not maintain the registers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand the reason for the Government's opposition to new clause 37. If reasonableness is to apply when offering advice to homeless people, such advice must be provided by someone who has the facilities to take note of what accommodation is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said this morning, there must be a rolling register because new accommodation will become available every week within any area. Therefore, someone should maintain a register of the addresses of that alternative accommodation. It is alarming that the Minister now opposes the principle of maintaining a register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fact, the Minister is brass-necked: this morning, he implied that he accepted in spirit the need for a register; this afternoon, he said that it is not appropriate. How the Minister can say that is beyond me. Therefore, I ask him to reconsider his opposition to new clause 37, which was moved so ably by my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe). The Minister should consider what he said this morning before he makes a final decision on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Madduck</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister really believes in what he is trying to do under the Bill, I do not understand why he opposes new clause 37, except that Ministers do not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0482">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>849</span>
like bureaucracy or giving extra powers to local government, especially when money is involved. In this morning's debate on clause 155, we considered what represented suitable accommodation in an area. New clause 37 would be a good way to ensure that local authorities become aware of the suitable accommodation in their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with interest to the Minister's comments on how the private rented sector was going to improve because of the Bill. Oh that I thought that it would deal with the horrendous problems of unfit housing in the private rented sector. I cannot conjure up the figures at the moment, but the number of unfit properties in this country is amazing. Oh that with a few clauses in the Bill we could put that right. We know that there are so many unsuitable properties—especially not suitable for the applicants who are referred to them. We have had much discussion about vulnerable people and homeless families with children. Accepting the new clause would be one way for the Minister to make us believe that he really cares about what will happen to people who will be moved into the private rented sector when the Bill is enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am extremely disappointed by the Minister's response, and would be interested to hear him expand further about how he thinks that the provisions of the Bill will cure overnight the dreadful problem of the state of some properties in the private rented sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate reflected on my teeth; the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) referred to my neck. I am glad that there is only one more new clause to come, in case we proceed further down my anatomy; that might well cause some serious reflection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had an exchange this morning with the hon. Member for Normanton. I hope that when he reads 	<i>Hansard</i> he will have laid to rest his impression that I somehow implied one thing then and a different thing just now. As I recall, he expressed concerns about the costs that might be laid on a local authority and whether we would ask local authorities to assume them. I interpreted his remarks as expressing some hesitation about the principle of a register. I hope that the record will set that straight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is breathtaking. How can the Minister say that I was hesitating on the issue of a register, when I was pursuing the Minister and saying that we ought to have a register? I did ask who would be responsible for bearing the cost of such a register, but to say that I was hesitant about the question of having a register is breathtaking. The record will not show that to be the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have got to my lungs now, I think. The record of this morning debate will state clearly what each of us said and we will each stand by what we said on record, so it may be helpful if we do not attribute sentiments to each other until we read the record and see what those sentiments were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities will want to keep up with what the private rented sector has to offer. That is not the same as saying that local authorities must prepare, maintain and
	<span class='label label-info column'>850</span>
update a comprehensive register that is available for inspection—which is what the new clause would provide. I believe that the Bill allows local authorities to respond in proportion to what is relevant and sensible in their areas. The new clause goes too far in its prescription, which is why I oppose it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made a rod for his own back. Whenever he realises that an amendment or motion being moved by the Opposition has some good sense behind it and would help to improve the Bill, he immediately runs for cover and talks about guidance. I feel sorry for his civil servants. I expect that over the next few weeks they will have a hell of time trying to put all those pledges of guidance into effect. We will probably end up with a series of documents that will be even thicker that the Scott report, containing guidance on how local authorities should discharge their various responsibilities. The Minister will acquire a reputation for a different part of the anatomy than his teeth or his neck if he produces an impossible and indegestible code of guidance that tries to cover every possible eventuality about which we have moved amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, it is at least reassuring to know that the Minister recognises that there is some merit behind our proposals we think that that merit is sufficient for them to be included in the Bill. I ask the Minister to reflect a bit on good practice around the country—to which he referred—in encouraging responsible renting in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many local authorities have done excellent work: they have set up forums in which they can meet with landlords to explore ways of overcoming some of the hassles that create difficulties in private lettings; they have created rental deposit schemes—an issue which, for some reason, is dealt with in the next part of the Bill; they have made constructive proposals on housing benefit availability, model tenancy agreements, good landlord guides and many other elements of good practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last Friday I was in Brighton, where the authority has made exemplary progress on such issues. I was shown the fruits of one initiative to bring empty properties back into use by bringing the authority and the landlords together. Special grants are provided for landlords to put those properties into a fit condition, in exchange for which the landlords guarantee the availability of the properties at a reasonable rent for people nominated by the council for up to five years. That is a thoroughly sensible, practical arrangement, along the lines that we are proposing in the new clause. I do not understand why the Minister is so reluctant to accept the principle. Specifying it in the Bill would advance the cause and would not force unfortunate officials to spend even more time than they were already condemned to do in an attempt to find words to express the Minister's good intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall press the issue forcefully in an attempt to insert a new clause into the Bill to make clear the obligation on local authorities, in view of their considerable new responsibilities for the relief of homelessness, to set up arrangements to ensure that they have a register of local landlords, which will help in providing a supply of good quality accommodation for those in need locally who are homeless or otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Indeed I am, but I am not surprised, because the Government are afraid to regulate anything. Guidance is given and Ministers cite examples of good practice from local authorities, but the Government abdicate their responsibility to regulate. That is not good enough when dealing with vulnerable people, particularly in view of the Government's assertion that the private rented sector is the most appropriate area for development in resolving homelessness. The new clause would provide adequate safeguards and protections and would let everyone know where they stood. We shall put it to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>852</span>
This will be the last debate that we have in this Committee about homelessness, and it is entirely appropriate that the subject should be day centres. Day centres provide a lifeline to significant numbers of single homeless people, many of whom sleep rough. Many of those people have a long history of insecurity, which results in their having very little to give them confidence, hope and a sense of belonging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many hon. Members know a great deal about the work of day centres. They visit day centres in their own constituency or those in London which arrange open days so that people can come and see the important and valuable work they do. A few weeks ago, an impressive meeting took place here which was organised on behalf of day centres and which many hon. Members attended. Unfortunately, that meeting coincided with a sitting of the Committee, and some of us were prevented from going. However, I received reports that it was a useful, valuable and much-appreciated meeting, which reflects great credit on all those who took part in organising it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Particular credit should be given to people from the Campaign for the Homeless and Rootless, an organisation that has worked tirelessly for many years on behalf of single homeless people. CHAR organised that meeting and brought together a large number of those involved with and interested in the work of day centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of a day centre is obvious: it provides for people who have no settled home of their own a place to which they can come, where they can relax, where they can get some food to eat, where they can have some company, where they can get some warmth—a particularly important consideration for those who sleep rough on the streets at night—where they can wash and tidy up, and where, on certain days of the week in some day centres, they can get medical attention. The best day centres provide a range of such services in a warm and friendly atmosphere, which gives a sense of hope and reassurance to people who have very little going for them in their lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would place a duty on local authorities to secure provision in their area of the sort of facilities offered by day centres. The new clause makes it a duty of every local authority:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to secure within their district the provision for persons to whom this section applies of such facilities as are calculated to assist them".</p></blockquote>
It goes on to define some of the services and facilities provided by day centres. Those include:
	<br><blockquote><p>"daytime shelter, washing and laundry facilities, facilities for the preparation of food"</p></blockquote>
and WC facilities. The new clause also allows for:
	<br><blockquote><p>"such other facilities, which may include the provision of nutritious food, as are in the opinion of the authority likely to assist persons to whom this section applies in any efforts they may make to secure accommodation."</p></blockquote>
That is what the new clause is about—providing a place where people who have no accommodation can come and receive support, food, guidance and help. As a result, they may be able to establish a settled pattern of life, which will enable them to move on to more settled or permanent accommodation. Everyone who is involved in the problems of homeless people knows that that is vital. Day centres provide a lifeline for people who are in the most extreme form of need and who
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0484">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>853</span>
require assistance, care, support and help to begin to reintegrate themselves into the rest of society and to establish a foundation on which they will be able to build a more settled life in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a vital facility and we hope that the Government will accept the amendment. However, I anticipate that the Minister will not accept the amendment. I suspect that he sympathises with it and would like to accept it, but that he is not allowed to. Another feature about the Minister is that he is not entirely master in his own house. He has tried to ameliorate a Bill which he does not believe in but which was produced by his boss, the Secretary of State. He is required to deliver it in a form that is vaguely acceptable to his boss, who will no doubt look at it with horror when it comes out of Committee. The Minister will probably be blamed for all the good things that the Committee has done to try to improve the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that we shall not receive the generous response that we would like and which, in his heart, the Minister would like to give us. Instead, we shall be given a feeble excuse for not accepting the new clause. We shall probably be told that it would be too onerous on local authorities and that he will ask his civil servants to prepare guidance to encourage local authorities to do their best. In the interests of the civil servants, who have had a pretty raw deal, I hope that the Minister will do the right thing and accept the new clause. There would then be no need to write any guidance. The new clause makes sense and would do the right thing for homeless people. I sincerely hope that the Minister will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to add my support to the new clause. It is important to recognise the good work that has been done by day centres throughout the country. We know from case histories how valuable such centres are in enabling people to gain confidence and to obtain advice and medical help. It is often their first step in returning to permanent, secure accommodation. There is tremendous support from all the people and groups involved, especially those dealing with single homeless people and people who have been sleeping rough. I know that the Minister understands their needs and I hope that he will do battle with his senior Minister to enable the new clause to be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This gives me an opportunity to put right a comment that was wrongly recorded in the report of our proceedings earlier. I described the work done in Southampton by a group called St. Dismas, but that was reported as "business".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That organisation is concerned particularly with people with alcohol problems. It runs an incredibly good day centre and works with the health authorities to provide health help and doctors' surgeries for those who sleep rough and do not have permanent accommodation. Such work is taking place throughout the country and the Bill provides a golden opportunity for even more to be done to help those who are absolutely roofless and spend weeks living in parks and sleeping on benches. The new clause could be their route out of that miserable existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Extra day centres have been set up this winter, which I have visited. A new one was developed in Bournemouth in recent years, which I have visited. I know the
	<span class='label label-info column'>854</span>
work that it does and other members of the Committee know the sort of work that it does. I know that the Minister knows the work that it does and I hope that he will not try to find excuses for not enabling that work to continue and expand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At least the debate is ending with a reference to my heart. The motto of the hon. Member for Greenwich is that the old tunes are the best. The tune that he has just hummed is the one that he has hummed throughout our proceedings. It is an entertaining tune and we have all enjoyed it. I suspect him of being at the root of the attempts to discredit me by having me praised in 	<i>The Guardian,</i> but I shall ignore that insidious attack on my career prospects and concentrate on the subject matter at hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman rightly gauged my response to the new clause. My purpose is to try to identify where clear problems exist and to direct a specific approach to those problems. The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Members for Christchurch said that the matter concerns rough sleepers and that is the heart of it. We try to deal with it through funding under section 73 of the Housing Act 1985, as the hon. Gentleman will be aware. That funding goes to voluntary organisations with specific projects for the prevention and relief of homelessness, and it operates through 21 day centres. Under clause 140, local authorities will be able to provide assistance, including grants or loans, to facilities that are similar to those mentioned in the new clause. It is the prescriptive nature of the new clause that I am unable to accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Day centres are crucial—I have visited many of them, as have other members of the Committee. I know that they carry out important work and that voluntary organisations lie at the heart of day centres. People who work there have a range of expertise and skill, and they have accumulated much experience in dealing sensitively with people, knowing how far those people can go and what they can ask them to do. We have agreed that the most unfortunate people often need to be coaxed into a framework in which they can receive care. It is not just a question of saying to those people, "Here is some assistance. Come and use it." One often has to overcome many barriers before those people are willing to accept some kind of shelter, which, under the best circumstances, will end with the provision of permanent accommodation in which the person can be autonomous. We all know how many stages have to be passed through before one reaches that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I announced a short while ago the next stage of the rough sleepers initiative. We recognised the need to do two things. The first was to provide specialist help to focus on hard core problems. There is no such thing as an absolutely permanent hard core—it is a mistake to believe in it. For example, There is a floating population of people who drift in and drift out of shelters. There is certainly a hard core of problems to be dealt with—even if the people are not the same—which includes problems relating to drink, drugs and mental illness; it also includes physical debilitation, because people who suffer from one of the other problems may also be in a physically poor condition. In central London, for which we have announced our plans, there are special units to deal with people who are undergoing detoxification,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0485">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>855</span>
where they can dry out, and we have provided special units for people with mental health problems. We are trying to deal with a range of specialist needs, which are often integrated and are very difficult to separate. Those who have multiple disadvantages are at the heart of the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also responded to the suggestion from voluntary organisations that we should provide further units of permanent accommodation. I believe that roughly 3,300 units have been arranged under the early phase of the initiative, 700 or so units are still to come through the system and more than 1,000 units are still to be provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second thing that we tried to do in the rough sleepers initiative was to identify where there were clear problems outside central London, including in outer London—many representations that we received involved people in outer London boroughs. I believe that we approached 23 areas outside central London and said, "Please demonstrate the needs that you have and the provision that may be necessary." Representatives from Bristol were able to state clearly the problems that that city suffered, and we have invited them to produce a clear strategy to tackle those problems. Part of that strategy may well include the provision of additional day centres, which perform a crucial function. We are currently organising an analysis of needs in the remaining area to identify the local situation. Those local authorities will be invited, along with voluntary organisations, to present to us a strategy that will be relevant to the local situation. Obviously the range of participating areas is large: it includes the great industrial cities and areas with different environments and perhaps different problems, including Exeter, and Gloucester, in the south-west, and Bournemouth, which includes the constituency of the hon. Member for Christchurch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to target the money that is available. I was determined to deliver rough sleepers three, to which I am personally strongly committed. We should place remedies in the hands of the voluntary organisations that have done a remarkable job delivering solutions. I pay fulsome tribute to the work that they have done and the co-operation that has be realised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee recognises the strong commitment that the Government feel towards that matter. We are trying to direct resources where they will be used most effectively. If areas with outstanding need that have not been included on my list make the case that they should be included, I will examine their request.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to end this part of our proceedings on a note of consensus, I hope that the hon. Member for Greenwich will reflect on his amendment. Certainly, he will appreciate the strength of my conviction that I want to deal with the problem as effectively as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will be extremely brief. There have been moments during the past couple of months when I thought that the Committee was providing a day centre for some of us. Any observations on this subject are likely to sound like rhubarb, rhubarb, but there are a significant number of day centres in my constituency and I join other hon. Members in their moving tributes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>856</span>
The new clause refers to provision by individual authorities around the country. I am glad to say that the day centres that I have visited in my constituency are generous in their praise for local authority support. Specific funding for particular projects is reasonably straightforward. The problem lies with core funding for overall activity and anything marginal. In particular, I am concerned that the problem may be exacerbated in the near future by indigent asylum seekers. I hope that some of the savings that the Government are making by changing the benefit regulations for asylum seekers will be recycled to the day centres, which provide something of a safety net on behalf of the whole community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to follow the right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South (Mr. Brooke) who referred to the number of day centres providing invaluable services in central London. There are, of course, many more in London boroughs surrounding Westminster which are doing equally sterling work. Our only concern is that there should be more effective help and, indeed, more help to centres to ensure that they get the core funding highlighted by the right hon. Gentleman. That is the most difficult thing. It is much easier to raise funds for a new initiative—there is always a premium on innovation in the voluntary sector. It is much harder to obtain continuing funding for essential services that are to be provided day after day, week after week, year after year, so that a centre is there and people can benefit from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister is worried about this matter. I am grateful for his helpful remarks about ensuring better and more extensive help for rough sleepers. I hope, on reflecting on the purposes behind the amendment, that he will see what more can be done by the Government in the months ahead to ensure that help is given to day centres to continue their important work.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments deal with a technical issue in the valuation provisions for collective enfranchisement contained in schedule 6 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993. The Committee will be aware that the schedule provides that the price the freeholder should receive for his interest comprises three elements: first, the open market value for freeholder's interests; secondly, the freeholder's share of any marriage value; finally, the amount of compensation due.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 574 deals with the calculation of the open market valuation of freeholder's interest and redefines two of the special purchasers, who are assumed not to be in the market to buy for the purposes of making this calculation. The reason for defining "special purchasers", is that they have a particular interest in the property and might be expected to pay more for the freehold than a third party. This special interest, therefore, has to be discounted in order to arrive at a true market price. Clause 82 includes any participating tenant as a special purchaser, but the amendments seeks to widen this to include any tenant in the specified premises, including those who may not be participating in the sale, as they might also be willing to pay more than the open market value for the freehold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, clause 82 refers to an owner of an intermediate leasehold interest as a category of special purchaser. The amendment narrows this to intermediate leaseholders of additional property since intermediate leaseholders in the specified premises are covered by new paragraph (b) of the clause.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first of the clauses relating to leasehold reform, and it seemed appropriate that we should mark the occasion with a more general debate about some of the key issues relating to leasehold reform that we shall consider in this and subsequent sittings. The history of leasehold reform over the past 10 years or more has been a sorry story of failure. Leasehold is an inherently unsatisfactory tenure. It is a tenure that has enabled freeholders to amass substantial fortunes by selling and reselling their land, obliging the leaseholder to bear all the costs of maintaining the property. In many cases the leaseholders have even built the property in the first place, but it is the freeholder who benefits from the reversionary interests. That is a type of tenure that has benefited the few, not the many.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I can see the general thread of the hon. Gentleman's views. I am obviously conscious of it in my constituency. But I hope that there will be a short passage on the notable architectural contribution which the leasehold principle has made to the centre of London and in particular to our great squares.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am only too happy to accept the important contribution to the street scene of central London that has been made by properties that have been built in the leasehold tenure, the freehold tenure and the rented tenure. I do not believe that there is a unique characteristic that is attributable to one form of tenure, although certain characteristics will reflect the period in which developments took place. Some leasehold property was developed at a time when the prevailing architectural style was very pleasing and is one that we respect and enjoy in our city today. But is is a mistake to assume that there is an inherent architectural merit in the tenure, because there are additional disadvantages to it which may make it not such an attractive proposition for leaseholders who live in the property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry Bellingham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-West Norfolk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely what we must try to keep in perspective is the fact that all these contracts were entered into freely. No one has to buy a leasehold if they do not want to. Some people were obviously lucky to inherit a leasehold. But people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0487">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>859</span>
bought them knowing exactly where they stood. Surely that has to be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many contracts were entered into freely in the past. Children worked down coal mines on contracts that were entered into freely. Society said that that was inappropriate and should come to an end. The majority of leaseholders in central London did not have a free choice to enter their accommodation. They had no alternative. The only way they could find flats was through leasehold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not have a commonhold tenure in this country. We are unique in the world in retaining this archaic form of tenure which dates back to feudal times. Everywhere else in the world has parted with it and has replaced it with more appropriate types of tenure such as the strata title in Australia or the condominium arrangements in America which enable people to buy the freehold of their individual flat and collectively to own the freehold of the block. That is a framework that I would have thought commanded support on both sides of the House. Conservative Members gave their support to a manifesto in 1992 which committed the Government to introduce commonhold. That commitment has not been honoured. They have not introduced it although they supported it. We supported it and we will introduce commonhold because we recognise that it is a far more satisfactory tenure in the longer term for people who want to occupy flats in our cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scope for abuse has been highlighted a great deal in recent months. One of the inherent problems with the leasehold tenure is that it has enabled certain people, some more unscrupulous than others, to acquire large fortunes by charging sometimes extortionate sums for dubious services. There have been some horrendous examples recently: a gentleman called Mr. Bebbington and his associates in a firm called Malthouse Chevalier have been quite unscrupulously exploiting the capacity of the leasehold tenure to require their leaseholders to pay unreasonable amounts in service charges or to meet unreasonable repair costs. They have done so by holding the threat of forfeiture over their heads, saying, "Unless you pay, we will force you to forfeit your lease and lose your home." Such abuses are an inherent problem in leasehold tenure. That is why the case for leasehold reform is so strong and why there have been many forceful advocates for such reform, over many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour Government made an important move towards leasehold reform by introducing the Leasehold Reform Act in 1967 which gave leaseholders in houses the right to enfranchise—to own the freehold of their home. That enabled hundreds of thousands of leaseholders in houses to become home owners. The Act was very successful and many people have reason to be grateful for that legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sadly, the more recent moves for leasehold reform have been less successful. The Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 was the first introduced by this Government, followed by the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987. The Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 is the latest in the line. Those Acts have had only a very limited effect. The 1985 Act was the most
	<span class='label label-info column'>860</span>
influential; it required the freeholder to provide information to leaseholders, imposed controls on service charges and gave rights to information about the composition of service charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1987 Act introduced the right of first refusal for leaseholders when a freeholder disposes of his property; it gave a right to leaseholders suffering from inefficient or unsatisfactory management to have a manager appointed by the court, and gave leaseholders a right in certain cases to take over the ownership of a property where there was not just a failure of management but a persistent failure by the freeholder to provide a proper service. That Act has been almost entirely unsuccessful. I have been unable to find any example of someone who has benefited from part II or part III of that Act, which gives the right to have a manager appointed or to acquire the ownership of the property. The Minister may be able to give us a figure, but to date I have been unable to trace a single beneficiary of those parts of the Act. As to part I, which gives the right of first refusal, as we saw too clearly last year, it has been possible for huge estates, such as Smiths Charities—it sounds nice, but its behaviour has been less principled than its name implies—to fly in the face of the law and to sell the whole estate to another body over the heads of the leaseholders, with almost total impunity. That is a measure of the ineffectiveness of the 1987 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some members of this Committee served on the Committee that considered the 1993 Act, which was designed to extend the provisions of the 1967 Act to leaseholders in flats. The 1993 Act extended to flats the concept of enfranchisement applying to houses only, which the 1967 Act introduced. The problem is that the measure was so filled with complexities and concessions to the big landowners that the procedures became tortuous in the extreme, and it has proved very difficult for leaseholders to obtain the advantage that Parliament intended. The numbers so enfranchised have been relatively small; some brave souls have managed to go through the process and have benefited from it, but far fewer have done so than expected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman accept that the 1993 Act has been successful in larger blocks of 100 or more flats, where the leaseholders have been able to get together and afford the cost of a solicitor for this expensive process? Enfranchisement has occurred, but not in the smaller, simpler cases, which should be easy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. He highlighted costs, which have proved a deterrent to many leaseholders who were considering enfranchisement. It is a complex process, which entails the possibility of a series of appeals by the freeholder. The marriage value formula and any claims for compensation from the landowner may involve considerable cost. Cost is a particular deterrent. As the hon. Gentleman said, only a few cases, especially those in which larger interests have shared the costs, and thus taken the process forward, have had successful outcomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government made three attempts at leasehold reform—in 1985, 1987 and 1993. They failed to achieve their objectives. We are again considering provisions under the heading "Leasehold Reform", but the provisions will not achieve significant leasehold reform. They simply tidy up unclear or unsatisfactory elements
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0488">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>861</span>
in previous legislation. The Government's preamble describes them as "minor amendments". They will not be able to tackle the wider issues that I outlined. The Bill requires substantial amendments that deal with crucial issues, such as enabling leaseholders to enfranchise their homes in a way that is fair to them and their landlords, and avoids unnecessary and unreasonable costs, which would deter many from pursuing their legal rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Protection should exist for leaseholders and tenants who have suffered abuses from the likes of Mr. Bebbington, who exploit their powers as landowners to impose unreasonable or extortionate charges, and threaten forfeiture. The most effective way in which to provide such protection would be to introduce a right to manage. That would give leaseholders a similar right to that which the Government gave local authority tenants who wanted to control the management of their homes. What justification can the Government provide for denying to leaseholders the benefits that they granted council tenants?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We support fundamental changes to the detailed provisions of the 1987 and 1993 legislation that have made it difficult for leaseholders to obtain justice. Curious procedures that involves substantial costs, arrangements that enable landowners to defy the law with impunity, unnecessarily complex, difficult and bureaucratic processes should be amended to ease the position of leaseholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know only to well from representations by leaseholder interests that there are serious problems to tackle. I am delighted that representatives from two of the organisations that have done most over the years to defend leaseholders' interests and present the case for reform are in the Committee Room. The Leasehold Enfranchisement Association, which is led by the redoubtable Joan South, has provided enormously valuable information to Members of Parliament for many years. We all own a debt to Joan South. The Campaign Against Residential Leasehold Abuse has campaigned effectively in recent months against abuses that have been all too apparent. It has provided not just an excellent resource for leaseholders in difficulty, but a first-rate resource for Members of Parliament who need full, accurate information about the problems, and helpful suggestions on how to tackle them. We owe it to those organisations and to leaseholders throughout the country to ensure that we do not end up repeating the mistakes of the past by tinkering with a system that is fundamentally unjust and crying out for fundamental reforms. Our purpose is to achieve reforms that will give real rights to leaseholders, that will speed up the process of enfranchisement and will pave the way to more satisfactory forms of tenure in future for people who live in flats. I sincerely hope that we shall be able to make much more progress this time than was achieved previously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Greenwich has said things about leasehold reform with which I entirely agree. I am sorry that he said that our history was a sorry story; it should not be discussed in that way. But if we look back, there has been an evolution of property rights and matters have changed over centuries. Now, in
	<span class='label label-info column'>862</span>
1996, we have come to a time when we should look for a further change in property issues and property rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We began with the feudal system when people held freeholds from the Crown, on the grant of land by the king or queen. In the 16th and 17th centuries, land was largely agricultural, even on the outskirts of London and we had great landed interests and sharp divisions in our society. There was no middle class. There were great landowners, who were noble, and, at the other end of the scale, serfs who did not expect to make a fortune in this country and had to go abroad, on a ship, to acquire wealth. A lot of our land was founded on India, gained by the sort of thing which, today, would put one in the courts fairly rapidly.

There has been an evolution. By the 18th century, the great landowners, with the Grosvenor or Cadogan estates and so on around London and elsewhere, wanted to dispose of land, but it was philosophically impossible for them to do so. So, they thought up the great idea of leasehold. I can understand that; there was not the opportunity that we have today, or the variety of investment. All investment had to be in the land. They had the great idea of passing ownership of the land for a long period. That is how leasehold started.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have been extremely tolerant in allowing the hon. Gentleman, and, to a lesser degree, the hon. member for Greenwich, a wide range. Perhaps now the hon. Gentleman might come to clause 82 rather than giving the history and geography of leasehold.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not giving the geography of leaseholds, but one has, with respect, Mrs. Winterton, to give the background to leasehold and the range of reform, because we are looking at change. When I was interrupted—quite rightly interrupted; I do not want to incur your wrath—I was just reaching the point of leaseholds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman reads clause 82(3)(1A)(c), he will see that it refers to "an intermediate leasehold interest". I heard him describe the process by which the Grosvenor estate and others transformed the ownership of their properties into leasehold arrangements—I suspect that that was an entirely appropriate description of an intermediate leasehold process, of which I am sure that we should like to hear more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Land was disposed of on long leases, and landowners were able to say that they were not disposing of their land. My right hon. Friend the Member for City of London and Westminster, South said, "What about the great architectural heritage?" That architecture did not derive form the landowners, however, as they had passed the land on—or sold it—on long leases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to delay matters, and I did not come back to the hon. Member for Greenwich when he dismissed—or at least mildly diluted and devalued—my observation, but the fact remains that when any of the great landed estates built one of the great

	<span class='label label-info column'>863</span>
squares, they were responsible for determining what the architecture of that square would be. The covenant, under which people acquired the land in order to build, made it a condition that the front of the house would follow the plan that the great landowner had been responsible for designing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the same argument, my right hon. Friend will know that that was before there were any local authorities, county councils or planing laws. Planning laws have now taken over from those rather enlightened people who wanted to plan valuable properties in areas that were valuable to them. I cannot concede that, in 1996, with all our planning laws, we need great landlords to decide whether the front of a house should be designed in one way or another. That is now subject to local authority planning laws, which have completely taken over the role of the landowners. Although there are some beautiful, historic parts of London, we cannot live on history for ever to justify the continuance of a system that I find it philosophically impossible to agree with.

Land has always been a great asset, for which there has been a great demand. The acquisition and ownership of land was in the hands of the few, so there was not much available for others, I am concerned about contracts, because we are talking about supply and demand. The landowners own the properties, and people who want to live in the centre of London have invariably had to do so on a leasehold basis—there is no choice. The concept of a contract is the last refuge in an argument that I believe to be based on a false premise—an 18th century premise, not a 1996 premise. I agree that we should be looking to a system of com-monhold. Philosophically, I hold the view that tenants should be able to purchase their freeholds, and as few restrictions as possible should be placed in their way.

The other day, I saw in the newspaper that a house in Cornwall was for sale for £350,000. There was much detail about the house. It belonged to the Duchy of Cornwall, which wanted £350,000 on a 99-year lease. Looking at the details, I reflected that £350,000 was just about the freehold value—perhaps a few pounds more. In 1996, the Duchy of Cornwall could take that £350,000 and invest it. In 99 years it will probably be worth £50 million. In 99 years the Duchy also gets the house back, when it will probably be worth £15 or £20 million. So it will get its money twice over. There is no moral or proper ground for that. If it wants to invest its £350,000 but does not want to continue investing in housing, it can invest it in stocks and shares, that is the difference between today's society and that of the 18th century. The philosophical reason for leaseholds does not apply today, and all the arguments that we have been hearing are wrong.

I welcome all the clauses in this chapter—clauses 82, 83 and so on—and the new clauses that will be moved. They are all good and will improve on the existing provisions, but we have created a monster that is not working. We have created a most complex system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have table later amendments, and when we come to consider them I will be able to argue for them. I have had talks with the Minister, and his first reaction was to say, "What about the marriage value?" If I may use the
	<span class='label label-info column'>864</span>
phrase, Mrs. Winterton, to hell with the marriage value. I cannot understand why we have the concept of a marriage value. A landlord who sold his property on a 99-year lease got virtually the freehold value. Why do we have talk about marriage values when the lease has 50 years to run, for goodness sake? The whole thing should be a simple exercise. The landlord has got rid of the leasehold at a ground rent of, say £100 a year. Not only has he got his £350,000, he also gets an annual income of £100. What then is the value of the freehold? If the money were invested in a company, it might be worth seven or eight times as much. Let us be generous; let us say that it would be worth 10 times as much. The value of the freehold is £1,000. To talk about marriage values is absolute and utter nonsense. That perpetuates the myth of the sanctity of contracted leases. As I said, I consider long leaseholds to be a scam in our modern society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be considering the matter far more vigorously; we should be considering ways to simplify the system, to make it easier for people to purchase their freehold, to stop bad landlords—about whom we have heard—from obstructing that, and to ensure that bad landlords are not able to benefit from their own failures and misuse of the freehold. I hope to deal with those matters when we discuss subsequent clauses and amendments that I hope will be selected.

I appeal to my hon. Friends carefully to consider what we are talking about. We have been talking about a property-owning democracy and a rising middle class, but we are stuck in the 18th century in our concepts and views. We are terrified of what the other place might say. That is where the problems are. The great estates fought tooth and nail to keep leaseholders' rights.—I would expect them to do so, because that was in their interest. There are people who have suffered in their own constituency as a result of the great landowners. We must be courageous and consider what changes we need. We must decide what is right and what future society we want. I hope that the Government will change their whole philosophy in relation to marriage values.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I wish to balance the intemperate remarks of the hon. Member for Greenwich. I am sorry to disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (Mr. Ashby). The hon. Member for Greenwich went on a long tour d'horizon of various leasehold enfranchisement Acts. He omitted to mention the fact that, in 1967, when the Labour party formed one of the most radical Governments in history, they had the majority to include enfranchisements for flats, but did not do so because they realised how difficult that would be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Millions of people live in leased properties. While they might want to enfranchise if they think that they can confiscate properties from their landlords, when it comes to writing out a cheque for the proper market value—including the marriage value, because if that were not included it would amount to confiscation from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0490">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>865</span>
the landlord—they do not want to write out the cheque. That is why so few people have wanted enfranchisement under the 1993 Act.

The leasehold system provides the huge diversity of property owning that people now enjoy. It provides a ladder for people to buy property in London and in other capital cities that they otherwise could not afford. That is why in so many capital cities almost all properties are rented and not owned. The leasehold systems in
	<span class='label label-info column'>866</span>
this country works well; if that were not so, why would thousands of people willingly go to the estate agent each year and buy a lease? They enjoy doing so and can afford to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
