	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Raynsford 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 472, in page 72, line 20, at beginning insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1) This Part has effect for the purposes of preventing homelessness among persons threatened with homelessness and securing accommodation for homeless persons.'.</p></blockquote>
I am delighted to say that I am not entirely confused and that I shall focus my attention on the amendment that relates to clause 136 with which we begin our scrutiny of part VII of the Bill on homelessness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Homelessness is, by almost any definition, the most extreme form of housing need. It is an affront to any society that aspires to be civilised and humane. It is, therefore, a matter of profound concern that so many people are homeless in Britain today. The official figure that was published recently showed that 120,000 households were officially accepted as homeless in England in 1995. Many more—mainly single and childless households—were homeless, but were not recorded as such. It is one of the most sobering comments on the inadequacy of the official figures that the majority of those people who in the minds of the public are the most obvious symbol of homelessness—those sleeping rough on the streets—do not feature in the official statistics. The reason why is that they are generally single and childless and would not qualify for accommodation from a local authority if they approached it, or they do not choose to do so. The official figure of 120,000 is very much the tip of the iceberg.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also a matter of profound regret that the number of homeless people has more than doubled during the lifetime of this Government. I accept that the figure of 120,000 is not the highest that it has ever been. The peal was reached in 1991, when 145,000 households were officially accepted as homeless. Mercifully, since then the number has reduced a little. However, the present
	<span class='label label-info column'>684</span>
figure of 120,000 is more than double the level in 1979 when 55,000 households were officially accepted by local authorities as homeless. The current figure is at roughly the same level that it was in 1989 and I shall return to the significance of that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time as there has been such an alarming increase in the number of homeless people during the lifetime of the Government, the output of new homes for renting has plummeted. Over the past five years on average only 28,000 new homes have been started for renting by social landlords in Britain, the overwhelming majority by housing associations. That figure is the lowest for any five-year period since the end of the second world war. It compares with more than 120,000 starts a year during the five years of the last Labour Government. That is a stark reminder of how far the production of new rented housing to meet needs has collapsed under this Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any fair-minded observer looking at those simple statistics would conclude that the problem is based on supply. We are not building enough homes to meet the needs of people who require rented accommodation. That analysis was confirmed by the recent report of the Select Committee on the Environment, three of whose members are members of this Committee. It demonstrated that the scale of need is greater than is currently assumed to be the case by the Government and that it would be prudent for the output of housing to be increased substantially. Again, few fair-minded people could fail to agree with that analysis. The Government's priority should be to get more houses built for people in need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perversely, the Government have no plans to expand output. They have damaged the programmes of housing associations by making serious cuts in the Housing Corporations's approved development programme in the previous two Budgets. To all intents and purposes, they have stopped local authorities from building new houses. The Government have brought the output of new social housing to its lowest level since the second world war. They now propose to tackle the problem not by increasing the output of housing but by turning instead on the victims of the crisis that they have created—the homeless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are trying in part VII of the Bill to rearrange the order of priorities for the allocation of housing to take away the opportunity of homeless people to be housed directly. They are doing that—quite cynically—to conceal their culpability for the inadequate output of rented homes. A fair-minded observer would say that the solution was not to attack the demand side, which is what the Bill does, but to increase the supply of housing. There is an acute shortage, with an inadequate supply of housing, yet the Government propose to attack the victims of that shortage rather than to ensure that more homes are built.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government, of course, are somewhat uncomfortable about what they are doing. The more we hear from the Minister, the more we realise just how uncomfortable they are. In today's 	<i>Financial Times,</i> the Minister is reported as saying that the measures in the Bill are a necessary adjustment to legislation and that they form part of a larger package aimed at securing greater fairness in allocating tenancies. Those wonderfully warm words come from a Minister who wants to continue receiving the plaudits of the Opposition and others for being a reasonable and amenable person, but who is bringing forward measures that would demolish the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0390">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>685</span>
framework established by the House 19 years ago to meet the needs of the homeless—measures seen by many to have been a success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no justification for what the Government are doing. There is no evidence that existing legislation is not working. On the contrary, as we highlighted in previous debates, two reviews of the legislation have already been undertaken. The first was conducted under the Deputy Prime Minister, the right hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine), when he was Secretary of State for the Environment in the early 1980s; the second was conducted in the late 1980s by the late Lord Ridley and the Governor of Hong Kong, Mr. Patten, when they were Secretaries of State for the Environment. The latter review was completed in 1989. It concluded that the legislation was working reasonably well and that there was no need for change. An objective comparison of the situation then and now would show an extraordinary similarity. The number of people accepted as being homeless in 1989 is almost the same as it is today—about 120,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What changes have there been to justify the Minister's argument that the measures are a necessary adjustment to the legislation? What has happened to make those adjustments necessary? I look forward to hearing the Minister's justification. Any fair-minded, objective observer would say that the only difference is that the supply of housing has reduced even more since 1989 and that people in need of housing have even less prospect of being housed. That is the problem. The Government's dilemma is that their failure to build enough homes to provide an adequate supply has created an even more acute problem, and they are trying to solve that problem not by tackling the real cause but by taking away from the victims of those policies their entitlement to housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One defence that the Minister might use is that a court judgment has brought into doubt the validity of the existing legislative framework—the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977, which is now incorporated in part III of the Housing Act 1985. The Minister might argue that the judgment in the case of the Awua family last summer raised doubts about whether local authorities are under a duty to secure permanent accommodation but, if that is his view, there is a simple remedy, which has already been adopted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some years ago, a similar situation arose in the Pulhoffer case, and doubts were raised about the extent of duties. The correct response—prompted in another place, but accepted by the Government—was to say that it was necessary to amend legislation to clarify Parliament's original intention, which was that local authorities should secure permanent housing for people who were deemed to be not intentionally homeless and in priority need under the homelessness provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what the Government should do now. There should be a brief amendment—probably one clause only—to restore the pre-Awua position. We would support the Government in that, as it would be the correct response to questions concerning the statutory definition of local authority responsibilities. The Government are not doing that, however. They are making fundamental changes, putting the clock back to the era when local authority responsibilities were to secure not permanent housing for homeless people but only temporary accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>686</span>
In previous sittings, we have explored the provisions under the National Assistance Act 1948—the requirements, which are not clearly defined, on social services to secure temporary accommodation for persons in urgent need. The failure of that legislation in the 1960s and 1970s had appalling human consequences. Homeless families were left on the streets, shunted between areas and treated in ways that no civilised society could possibly contemplate. Families were split; mothers were received into former workhouse institutions and fathers were told to go away. Such conditions persisted until the 1970s, but they were ended by the 1977 Act, which rightly established a framework whereby homeless people were entitled to permanent accommodation if they satisfied the conditions of the Act, and local authorities were required to secure that permanent accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone who has examined the matter agrees that that is the correct response. Homeless people do not benefit from being placed in temporary accommodation. All the objective studies—the Minister's Department has conducted studies over many years—demonstrate the obvious advantage to families, children's education and to society as a whole of rehousing homeless families in permanent rather than temporary accommodation, which is generally more expensive, often sub-standard and disruptive to family life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no objective good reason for placing homeless families in temporary accommodation, but the miserable piece of legislation that we are debating will take us back to an era when the local authority's duty was not to secure permanent accommodation but when the emphasis was on a temporary solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are acutely embarrassed about that. They know that it is wrong and inappropriate. The Minister—who wants to be seen as fair minded—is desperately trying to recover from the impossible inheritance that he has been given, he offers concessions. Last week, we were told that the period for which local authorities would have the duty to accommodate people would be extended from one year to two years. The Minister justified that by saying that figures show that, on average, people remain in temporary accommodation for about 13 months, so that the concession would cover the vast majority of families who would be rehoused before the end of the two-year period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is all very well—the Minister is trying to appear reasonable and we welcome the climbdown—but it does not deal with the fundamental issue. A local authority's duties are still being weakened. It has a duty to secure permanent accommodation. That is the right response, rather than the unsatisfactory duty to secure temporary accommodation, albeit for two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were other fascinating concessions last week, such as the one concerning a framework to allow homeless people to be rehoused directly. The Bill did not originally envisage that. At first the Government said that that would be unacceptable, but then the Minister began to realise that the Bill would not work in its original form, so concessions had to be made. One of the concessions given was that those on the waiting list who had sufficiently high priority would be eligible to be rehoused directly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0391">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>687</span>
We then had the even more interesting concession that those on the waiting list with nearly enough priority would also be eligible to be rehoused directly. Despite pressing the Minister, he could not explain how that would work in practice, nor could he explain what would happen to a person on the waiting list with higher priority than someone who had been rehoused because he was homeless or on the waiting list with nearly but not quite enough points. Inevitably that will happen. There will be homeless applicants with slightly fewer points than others on the waiting list. What if someone remaining on the waiting list challenges the local authority's decision to allocate? We have had no answer to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are lawyers on the Government Front Bench and it cannot be beyond the imagination of a clever lawyer to see good scope for a challenge to a local authority's right to rehouse someone in those circumstances. The Government's policy is about the single route into housing, to use their words. What if a local authority is explicitly encouraged by the Minister to rehouse people with slightly lower priority ahead of those with higher priority on the waiting list? That is nonsense and the Minister and his hon. Friends know it. It is the product of embarrassment and the result of a Minister desperately trying to claw himself back from the impossible position he has been put into by the Secretary of State and his predecessors. He had introduced a set of proposals that are fundamentally unsound and which are unworkable in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had other examples of people who were not on the waiting list and who would not qualify for direct rehousing if they were homeless, such as those who never thought that they would need to be rehoused because their housing was perfectly satisfactory but who suddenly, because of a natural disaster or a terrorist outrage, find that their home is destroyed. Are we seriously expected to believe that such people should not be rehoused directly but should be forced to spend time in temporary accommodation because they were not registered on the waiting list? What nonsense. As my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) rightly said, it will give people a perverse incentive to register on the waiting list if they think that there is a possibility of their ever becoming homeless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What a comment on the Government's bizarre creation. People who become homeless through no fault of their own, in circumstances when any right-minded person would say that direct rehousing must be the right answer, will not qualify, leading to stacks of extra unnecessary applications on waiting lists. Bureaucracy will run riot because that is the only way that people can cover themselves against the possibility of becoming homeless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are still waiting for answers on all those matters. I suspect that we shall continue to wait because the Minister knows only too well that they are classic illustrations of the nonsense that the Government are trying to perpetrate. It is a framework that is riddled with anomalies and it will not work in practice. Rather than digging himself into even more untenable positions, the Minister should recognise reality and start the sensible process of trying to restore the good framework that was established in 1977, which has stood the test of time, has provided help to millions of homeless families, and which is recognised by everyone, including local authorities, housing associations, voluntary agencies and churches as a system that works well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>688</span>
Is it not time for the Government to admit that they are totally out of step with public opinion and out of line with with the opinion of all those who know what it is like for people to be homeless, and what is involved in the process of relieving homelessness and of housing allocation? Those who make the present system work and recognise that it is a better system than the one that it replaced do not want us to be pushed back towards the era of temporary accommodation, inadequate safety nets and homelessness leading to people literally on the streets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The framework established by the 1977 Act had all-party support. It was introduced, as I mentioned last week, by a Liberal Member of Parliament, Stephen Ross, and was supported by members of five political parties, including three Conservative Members of Parliament, two of whom remain Members of this House today and one of whom, the noble Lord Walker, is now in another place. It is a measure of the extent to which today's Conservative party has retreated from social responsibility and lurched to the right that we are presented with these miserable proposals designed to weaken that statutory framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We reject entirely what the Government are doing. This part of the Bill is the worst and the most damaging, dangerous and destructive legislation going through Parliament this year. We will fight it all the way. We have tabled a series of amendments designed to limit the damage and ensure that homeless people are still accorded reasonable priority and are still treated humanely. We will press those amendments as hard as we can. We hope that the Minister will go on making concessions, because some concessions are better than none, but his Bill is fundamentally defective. It is not the right way forward; it is riddled with anomalies; it will not ensure fair treatment for homeless people; it will lead to more gross injustices. Most fair-minded people recognise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that the Bill will be amended—if not in this House, then in another place, where Members are distinguished by a real care and concern for homeless people, which they have demonstrated over many years, not least by their good sense in introducing the amendments to rectify the problems created by the Pulhoffer judgment. I hope that our colleagues in another place will give the Bill the close scrutiny that it deserves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will not be long before the next Labour Government are elected. I assure the Minister that we will regard responsibility towards the homeless as one of our principal priorities. If we inherit an unsatisfactory situation, we will act quickly and purposefully to restore a proper framework based on the sound principles of the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977, which was passed with the support of the then Labour Government and had all-party support, and which, over the intervening 19 years, has provided a framework that works well and has protected millions of homeless people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be nice to think that the Minister would have a rush of common sense and would agree to our amendments, but I fear that he will not. I give him a warning: he will not go down in history with any distinction if his memorial is the undermining of the 1977 Act. It would be a sad memorial for a Minister who has, in many ways, shown himself to be concerned and caring. It is a sad day that he is moving this part of this Bill. I hope that he will have second thoughts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration (Mr. David Curry)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Anxious as I am to get on, I would not want the comments of the hon. Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford) to pass without some response. I knew that at some stage we would get him in his purple patch, and that we would witness a period of sustained political levitation accompanied by all the indignation that he is capable of summoning. We have experienced that this morning and it was quite entertaining. I apologise if my apparent reasonableness is an impediment to progress in the Committee, but I shall continue to try to be reasonable in my approach. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his persistent efforts to distance me from my own Bill, but I shall save him the need to try to do that. I support the proposals, which have a strong rationality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me begin by making a few remarks about the start of the hon. Gentleman's speech and where we have common cause. He referred to street homelessness and homelessness numbers. He will know that we have recently introduced the third phase of the rough sleepers initiative, which has been very widely accepted. We sought to direct that initiative toward areas of especial concern, such as mental health, drink, drugs and disabilities. We have introduced a series of measures that I hope will deliver, and which have been widely welcomed by the voluntary organisations on which we depend for the operation of such mechanisms. We have said that we are willing to consider analogous mechanisms in cities and towns outside London in which a problem can be identified. Bristol has already given us sufficient evidence for us to be able to invite it to come forward with detailed proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that there is a great divide between me and the hon. Gentleman concerning those people. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that there are many people who are street homeless who would not qualify under the Bill. Let us be blunt, there are many people who might be deemed to be intentionally homeless because they have chequered histories and things have happened in their past that a housing authority would say disqualify them from accommodation under homelessness provisions. That is not a reason not to try to take care of such people, but the method for doing so is much more protracted and difficult. It requires a great deal of coaxing to give such people confidence to enter a more structured system in which they can be provided with assistance. So we might try to find a consensus at least about the rough sleepers initiative and the street homelessness policy. As the hon. Gentleman said, the number of homeless is declining at present. I am pleased about that and hope that that decline can be sustained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then the hon. Gentleman went into his great rigmarole about house numbers, how the proposals are inadequate, and how the Government are building far too few houses. He quoted the Select Committee report—which I thought was moderately phrased—on housing need. He did not tell us anything about his remedies. We long for the moment when he lifts the
	<span class='label label-info column'>690</span>
veil on his policies. A couple of weeks ago—I think it was exactly a fortnight ago—we changed the order of consideration so that the great Labour housing shindig could take place in relative tranquillity a the Queen Elizabeth II conference centre. We expected that all would be revealed there. Naturally I turned—eagerly as always—to the housing press to find out whether all had been revealed. The editorial of 	<i>Inside Housing</i> was headlined:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A laborious birth of little consequence".</p></blockquote>
The editorial read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Only elephants spend as long in gestation as the housing policy proclaimed by Tony Blair on Tuesday. Unfortunately the creature that emerged this week had more in common with an ant.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Like ants, Labour's housing team"—</p></blockquote>
I think that the hon. Member for Greenwich is Labour's housing team—
	<br><blockquote><p>"busy themselves trying to make much of very little. The hard work is admirable. But the edifice is easily demolished."</p></blockquote>
After more in the same vein, the editorial continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On the plus side, Mr. Blair says he will attack homelessness, allow councils to build again through the phased release of capital receipts"—</p></blockquote>
we will hear that phrase over and over again, and it will mean less each time that it is uttered—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and encourage local housing companies. But these are rather old cherries on a very dry cake."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman will be aware that analysis suggests that the idea that there is a marvellous package of receipts sitting there with which lots and lots of houses could be built is not correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's own Treasury team will not allow him to redefine the public sector borrowing requirement—although he keeps urging them on. His instincts are to try to get them to make that change, but they have not yet budged on it, because, as far as I can tell, Labour does not want to give the impression that it would spend a penny of anybody's money on anything. Indeed, the editorial remarks that Labour is now becoming more beholden to the City than to the electorate. On this occasion, the Labour party's lurch to the right might even leave me marooned somewhere on the left. We should love to see just a single numeral or hear just a single idea about how the approved development plan would look under a Labour Government, but none is forthcoming. The Committee and the hon. Gentleman will therefore understand that I am not struck to my soul by his admonitions, even if I do not treat his great sermons with indifference.

The hon. Gentleman went on to dismiss the idea that the Government have sought to create a fair allocation system. He said that the Government wanted to create a smokescreen and a cover because there were not enough houses. Whatever the number of houses—the Labour party has not yet revealed how many houses it would build—the system under which they are allocated must be fair, and that is the Government's aim. People on the waiting list have fundamental needs, just as the problems of homelessness reveal fundamental needs. We had that debate when we discussed allocations, and I shall not rehearse last week's arguments, except to say that I do not resile from the views that I expressed then.

Let me not mislead the Committee about the impact of the Awua judgment. I have never claimed and do not claim that we introduced the Bill because of that ruling. We announced our intention to legislate well before the judgment; indeed, the judgment caught most people in the housing world somewhat by surprise. It said that a housing authority's duty could be discharged in as little as 28 days. The legal landscape against which we are legislating has, therefore, changed, although that was not our, and perhaps not the hon. Gentleman's, intention. I do not, however, want to give the impression that the Bill was a response to Awua.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a fundamental difference between me and the hon. Gentleman: whether homelessness results from long-term, deep-seated social, economic or health needs or from the coming together of circumstances that cause an immediate crisis, I do not accept that it should necessarily and invariably lead to the provision of permanent, subsidised accommodation. That is the nub of the argument between us. We should identify clear long-term needs, which should result in long-term accommodation. As the hon. Gentleman conceded, people are placed in temporary accommodation and the way in which many people in the overwhelming number of authorities go into permanent accommodation will not change in practice because of the Bill. The vast majority will secure permanent accommodation from responsible authorities well within the period of the duty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of his comments last week, with the Minister deal with the specific point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich. An authority might have a duty towards someone who is recognised as not intentionally homeless and as having nearly enough priority on the housing list to qualify for accommodation so that he could be housed ahead of someone with greater priority. Where are the local authority powers to do that in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me set out the problem. Christine Laird said that there was a possible glitch. Someone who had accumulated a significant number of points on the housing register might become homeless for whatever reason and then be housed in non-permanent accommodation because the local authority had to provide him with accommodation. As a result, he might lose points on the register because an unsatisfactory housing situation had been made satisfactory, although not permanent. It would have been unreasonable for the Bill to have such an unintended effect. I therefore considered the text and the guidance and clarified to Christine Laird that a local authority would, in those circumstances, have the flexibility permitted under the legislation to allocate permanent housing. That is a matter of granting sensible flexibility to local authorities, rather than laying down prescriptive rules or imposing an absolutely graven, carved set of procedures that local authorities must follow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister tell us whether, within the flexibility that he envisages, people who have not previously been registered on the waiting list might still be accommodated directly by a local authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am perfectly willing to go through the routes into homelessness, if that is what the hon. Gentleman wishes, but he knows them as well as I do.
	<span class='label label-info column'>692</span>
He knows perfectly well that first of all—I shall spell this out—a household presents itself as homeless. What then happens? The local authority has an interim duty to accommodate while checking the entitlement. For example, if the household is on the street, that duty will apply. Many people will apply for homeless status from insecure accommodation, which is perhaps about to be repossessed or, shared with a relative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authority then applies successive tests—a person from abroad, homeless, leaseless or threatened with being pushed out from precarious housing. Priority needs such as fire, flood and emergency remain unchanged from the 1977 Act. Another test is whether the homelessness is intentional or involuntary. All homelessness legislation has included some test of voluntariness. If the household passes those tests, the local authority will consider whether suitable alternative accommodation is available—a series of clauses and amendments deal with that later in the Bill. The local authority's duty is to give reasonable advice and assistance in securing accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens when the full duty is to accommodate for two years unless the applicant moves out or is offered permanent accommodation? The sort of property available is suitable private rented sector stock, perhaps accessed through landlord forums giving rent guarantees or fast-tracking housing benefit; housing association stock used on a temporary basis, and local authority temporary stock for up to two years in three. When someone is owed a duty to go straight into permanent housing when the household is already on the waiting list with enough points to get less attractive stock, the local authority has the discretion to promote such a household with nearly enough points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for the local authority to come to conclusions about the precise definition in the light of the chemistry of its own scheme when people are already on an exceptional list. Households with very high needs will be able to go on a list in the morning and be allocated housing in the afternoon, providing the stock is available. That duty ceases after two years. A household can reapply before eviction from a previous property and be reassessed. If the tests are passed, a fresh two-year period of duty starts. If a household is still in priority need and still has no suitable accommodation, the local authority can continue to sponsor accommodation for any period up to two more years. We shall come to the tests for alternative accommodation later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the routes into housing that the Bill foresees. For a vast number of people, it will be scarcely any different in practice from what it is now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the Minister. From what he has said, a person who loses his or her home in an emergency, but has not anticipated the need and is therefore not on a waiting list, will not be eligible for direct rehousing. How can the Minister possibly justify people bombed out of their home by the IRA being told that they must go into temporary accommodation because they cannot be rehoused directly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is just not being reasonable about this. Under the 1977 Act, if people face an emergency and are in urgent need, they will be

	<span class='label label-info column'>693</span>
provided for. If they are bombed out by the IRA—as happened in Docklands where much of the accommodation was provided by the local authority—the local authority will restore their accommodation and they will move move back into it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What if it is destroyed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is destroyed, those people are literally roofless and under the Bill they will be provided with housing within 24 hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Permanent housing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, of course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the hon. Member for Greenwich wishes to intervene, he is at liberty to do so, but not from a sedentary position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The local authority will register those people and provide housing almost immediately. We are all aware of such emergencies, but the hon. Gentleman should not present a combination of the worst catastrophes as a typical case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Ashby 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-West Leicestershire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend tell us whether people, faced with such a catastrophe in the past two or three years, have made the slightest complaint about the magnificent way in which the authorities—housing associations, local authorities and others—have responded and have looked after them in the medium term? Schools have often been used as temporary shelters, and they have eventually been rehoused. Can he give us even one example of such a complaint?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Member for Greenwich is trying to argue that, under the revised provisions of the Bill, people who have been bombed out of their homes would only be eligible for the roulette wheel of temporary accommodation. My point is that the provisions of the Bill will click into place and accommodation will be provided. Most of the people bombed out in Canary Wharf were already in council accommodation. Such people would expect the landlord to rehouse them as a priority because they were already tenants of the local authority, so the allocation provisions would not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude now, because we have had a longish debate on this matter and no doubt I shall want to reply to further interventions. Amendment No. 472—to which the hon. Gentleman did not refer in his speech, so I shall do so for him—seeks to put a declaratory phrase at the beginning of the clause. That declaratory statement was not thought necessary in the 1977 Act, so I see no purpose for it in this Bill. Therefore, I recommend against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford). The amendment would insert a statement saying that this part of the Bill
	<span class='label label-info column'>694</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"has effect for the purposes of preventing homelessness among persons threatened with homelessness and securing accommodation for homeless persons."</p></blockquote>
I listened to the Minister's reply to my hon. Friend. It seems from his response that the milk of human kindness has now gone sour. He gave no assurance that homeless people or people threatened with homelessness would find secure accommodation. In west Yorkshire, homeless people are subject to the roulette wheel of temporary accommodation. West Yorkshire has seen a decline in rented housing stock from 601,000 in 1981 to 461,000 in 1993—just short of 25 per cent. That was three years ago. The sale of houses has continued, so there is now a substantial reduction in rented accommodation in local authorities in west Yorkshire. The crux of the problem is that permanent accommodation is no longer available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A briefing from Wakefield housing department notes that in west Yorkshire, the loss
	<br><blockquote><p>"of lodgings with relatives or friends"—</p></blockquote>
the only way in which some people can find accommodation—
	<br><blockquote><p>"who were unable or unwilling to accommodate them was the main reason for homelessness and made up 28 per cent."</p></blockquote>
of homelessness cases in West Yorkshire. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Threatened homelessness due to mortgage arrears accounted for 281 cases or 15 per cent. of all homeless referrals."</p></blockquote>
That is in west Yorkshire, where five local authorities are involved with the issue of homelessness. That is the problem that the Minister should address, both as a neighbour of west Yorkshire and as the Minister responsible for some of the towns and cities there. He should be aware of the situation and help those authorities for whom he has ministerial responsibility to try to prevent homelessness and to encourage those people who are homeless or threatened with homelessness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are ways in which local authorities and housing associations can help such people, if the Government are prepared to give their support. People in Wakefield face homelessness, and yet there are homeowners there who want to sell their property but cannot because of problems in the housing market. The housing department of Wakefield metropolitan district council and Chantry housing association have formed a partnership with a view to leasing some of those homes, having improved the facilities and made the necessary changes to accommodate a family. That is proving to be a success, but they do not have sufficient resources to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister feels that the principle of the Wakefield pilot scheme is a good idea—he nodded his head in approval when I referred to it—he should allow the housing association and the local authority the necessary resources to continue it. More homes could then be leased from people who have difficulty selling them, and more homeless people could be allocated accommodation. The only problem is that the scheme is temporary. If the Minister is in favour of such schemes, will he assure us that he will continue to back them until permanent accommodation can be provided, either by the housing association or the local authority? What the Minister has said so far will not encourage the provision of permanent residences for people who are homeless or threatened with homelessness.

I recently received a letter that was sent to my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) by the Trafford user group, of which my hon. Friend is vice-chairman. The group expressed concern about the Bill in the light of its direct experience of the difficulty that people with mental health problems have in acquiring suitable accommodation. The Minister talked about giving priority to people with mental health disorders or mental disabilities. The Trafford user group, which has practical experience of trying to provide accommodation for those people, has made a request. Its letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is essential for people who suffer from mental ill health, to have a secure tenancy, not to be settled temporarily, only to be uprooted 12 months later, and not be found alternative accommodation by the Local Authority."</p></blockquote>
That explains what is happening in Trafford. My hon. Friend the Member for Stretford cannot be a member of the Committee, but in his correspondence with members of the Committee he has made it clear that the people of Trafford want to have their position clarified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is talking about vulnerable people; he referred to those with mental health problems. Earlier in our deliberations, I made it clear that such people would receive allocations to permanent accommodation outside the framework of the housing register.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome what the Minister says, but people's experience is different. One of the problems is that often the accommodation for such people does not exist. Assurances should be backed up with resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received a letter from a group of people in Blackpool complaining about the Committee's conduct over the question of housing benefit in houses of multiple occupation. I hope that we receive no more letters from Blackpool on the matter, but I remind those people that we lost the argument on those issues only by one vote. To make progress, hon. Members must take note of what their constituents feel and say. The best whips are not the official Government and Opposition Whips but our constituents. I hope that hon. Members remember that when deciding whether to support serious and significant amendments such as this, which would protect the most vulnerable of the people whom we represent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Diana Maddock 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We heard from the Minister this morning that homelessness is diminishing. However, it remains an enormous problem, and has virtually doubled since 1981.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked a lot about his dislike of the Opposition's indignation, and about his rationality. Yet there is more support among many organisations outside the House for the Opposition's indignation than there is for the Minister's so-called rationality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time and again, we have asked why we are in this position. The question has arisen again this morning. Why is the Minister trying to propose what he calls rational changes to homelessness legislation? The answer is the well-documented lack of affordable accommodation, which has come about because the original housing stock was depleted without being replaced with new stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1989, the Audit Commission recognised that, in the long run, there would be a need for more permanent housing. It called on the Government to increase
	<span class='label label-info column'>696</span>
investment in affordable homes. That has not happened, which is why we have the current problem. Even in 1989, it was believed that we needed 100,000 new social homes a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have said many times, in the Committee and outside the House, that social housing building is now at its lowest level since the war. That is why the problem exists. Between 1981 and 1993, there was a fall of 15 per cent. in the number of dwellings let by private landlords, local authorities and housing associations. In the same period, the number of homeless people doubled. We are still suffering from that, despite what the Minister said this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recovery in the private rented sector has also been very slow, yet that is where the Minister tells us that we will house many of the families in housing need. In other parts of the House, we are discussing how to help people to escape from benefit dependency, but I must tell the Minister that the proposals in the Bill will have exactly the opposite effect. We know what rents are in the private sector and, far from reducing people's dependency, using that option will be expensive for the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have said time and again, goodness knows what being caught up in a series of lets which change from year to year does to people. If people are moving from one community to another, they cannot receive community support, which is vital for communities to thrive. The effects on young children's education are enormous. Even getting access to health services can be very difficult, while job prospects are limited and made far more difficult for people who are on the permanent merry-go-round of temporary accommodation. The group of people about whom I feel most angry, especially given the problems of society today, are young people. We should be helping our young people up the ladder of life, not knocking them off the bottom rung as the Government seem to do not only in this Bill, but in their proposals for housing benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister needs to be reminded of the several reviews of the legislation which have occurred. In 1989, Christopher Patten, who was then the Secretary of State concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We believe the 1977 Act remains important as a 'long stop' measure to help people in need who have become homeless through no fault of their own. The present terms of the Act strike a reasonable balance between the interests of the genuinely homeless and others in housing need."</p></blockquote>
Other such comments were made at that time, and the Minister should take them into account when listening to our opposition to his proposals. Surveys concluded that there was no widespread demand from the local authorities that administered the legislation to change it or to restrict the rights of homeless people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1994, Shelter carried out a survey of 274 local authorities which were asked to comment on the homelessness legislation. Eighty-four per cent. of them considered it very or quite successful. In fact, the most frequent complaint was that legislation was too restrictive and that the categories of priority need should be broadened to include single people and couples without children. The second most frequent complaint was that the legislation was too vague. When the Chartered Institute of Housing asked 32 authorities whether they supported a move to make the housing duty discretionary, temporary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0396">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>697</span>
or both, 90 per cent. opposed such a move. There is evidence that that view has not changed. In fact, it is probably stronger now than it was then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has used arguments about queue-jumping. Again, it seems difficult to find any evidence that that is major problem. The Audit Commission looked into the issue in 1989 and commented:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is an oversimplification to depict the allocation of council housing as a competition between homeless applicants and these on the waiting list, with local authorities holding the ring. Homeless procedures are more accurately seen as one among several different means of determining priorities in the allocation of council housing."</p></blockquote>
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various hon. Members asked the Minister for further evidence of queue-jumping because we know—as, I suspect, he knows—that some of the local authorities' research shows that queue-jumping does not happen in many cases. I was expecting the Minister to provide some real evidence of queue-jumping this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me and my Liberal Democrat colleagues most is that the Government, not only through the Bill but through other measures, have time and again removed safety nets from people; that is why people end up in dire need. The existing legislation, which our discussions this morning have shown is adequate and does not need to be changed, was designed to give priority to people who were unintentionally homeless and in the greatest housing need. It has been shown to be an important safety net for some of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable people in society, helping them get off the roundabout of temporary accommodation and into secure homes. If the Government change section 22 of the Housing Act 1985 and remove the duty placed on local authorities to give reasonable preference in their allocation, they will be withdrawing a vital safety net.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is rightly proud of his rough sleepers initiative, which I and other hon. Members support. I am grateful that it may be extended to an area near my constituency in Bournemouth; I supported the cry for it from the local community. That initiative is fine to start with—but what will happen to those people later on? We want to move them through the different forms of tenure, a path that the bill will destroy. So if the Minister is serious about his rough sleepers initiative, he needs to ensure that it can be carried on. The Minister's comments on the Awua case were interesting; I remember sitting on a platform with him in Nottingham, when he gave a gloss to it that was different from the one he gave this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minster challenged the Labour party on its housing proposals; I have some agreement with him on that, but I do not agree with him on capital receipts. Many people outside believe that the money from capital receipts came from the sale of houses that were built with public money and should go back to social housing. The problem is that everyone, right, left and centre, is raiding capital receipts—including the right hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair), who has tried to raid them for other purposes, although I was given a strange explanation of that. Those funds will continue to be depleted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>698</span>
I am sorry that the Labour party is timid about the public sector borrowing requirement because that would be a way of helping local authorities get back their powers and their ability to provide social housing. We learnt this week that the Government had yet again got their figures wrong on the public sector borrowing requirement. The Opposition parties are often challenged about where we would find the money for extra social housing; I have not supported any budget cuts since I have been in the House, but have supported other costed budgets that would have retained that money for social housing and which would have avoided the huge cuts that we have had over the past two years—a halving of the investment in social housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he does not accept that homelessness should necessarily lead to permanent subsidised accommodation. If that is his view, we do not need to destroy totally the 1977 legislation. Mercifully, that is beginning to dawn on the Minister, as is shown by the amendments that the Government have tabled. What concerns me are children in families. As the Minister described the route into social housing, I thought what a huge proportion of a one-year-old's life he was describing. By the time that route had finished, the child would be getting on for five: what would have happened to him or her by then? What will happen to those future generations? The various children's charities which have lobbied us are also concerned about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister really believe that all the organisations lobbying outside this place are misguided? As this morning's discussions—even the contributions from Conservative Members—have shown, homelessness legislation has worked and has helped homeless families. It might needs a little improvement, but it should not be totally torn apart. As the hon. Member for Greenwich said, the Minister will, if he is not careful, go down in history as the person who removed the best rights that we can give from some of the most vulnerable families in our communities. I hope that, when he sees the results of the changes, he will remember what we have said, as I am truly concerned that the Government, as is often the case, have not carried out enough research on the real effects of the legislation. Other bodies have examined the effects, which I believe to be frightening. I hope that the Minister will consider that research before the Bill is discussed on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (Mr. Ashby) made a good point about the current performance of local authorities in assisting people who face crises and find themselves unintentionally—I shall return to that word—without a roof over their heads. Those local authorities are operating under present legislation, not under the measures proposed in the Bill. Existing legislation recognises that particular definitions of homelessness can and should provide a priority for permanent rehousing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and those urging changes to the legislation have skated over the fact that, under existing provisions, not all homeless people have to be offered permanent accommodation. People must be unintentionally homeless and must belong to a priority group. The Government did not start by looking for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0397">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>699</span>
failings in existing legislation. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock) that the problems that face local authorities in providing adequate accommodation for those who are unintentionally homeless arise from the fact not that the legislation is wrong but that there is not sufficient secure, permanent and decent accommodation to meet people's needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The genesis of the Bill lies not in dealing with that problem, but in constructing a conflict between different victims of the housing crisis. It was thought that it was somehow homeless people's fault that those on housing waiting lists were not receiving decent, secure accommodation. As we have heard, there is no evidence to back that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers argue that homelessness should not necessarily be a route into priority accommodation, but why do they not say that even under existing legislation it is not a passport to permanent accommodation? People who are regarded as intentionally homeless have no passport into permanent accommodation, and neither do people who are not regarded as belonging to a priority group. Indeed, under existing legislation, there are some vulnerable groups, particularly the young, who do not receive enough assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many members of the Committee have said that the way in which the Bill is framed is not the fault of the Minister, and they sympathise with him. Given what the hon. Gentleman has said today, he seemed to recognise that there are occasions when people find themselves out on the street, unintentionally homeless, which require sympathetic, swift and decisive action by local authorities. Examples that have been cited are fire, flood and other emergencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that, under the existing legislation and, I assume, under the Bill, people would still probably have priority in such circumstances. In practical terms, that would mean temporary accommodation in the first instance, not because it is preferable, but because it is the only accommodation that is available. At present, if a household is faced with being out on the streets as a result of such crises and ends up in temporary accommodation, that is not regarded as the best solution to the problem, but simply happens because no permanent accommodation is available. In other words, permanent accommodation is preferable to temporary accommodation. Yet the Government have turned that logic on its head under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister can correct me if I am wrong, but under the Bill the norm should be temporary accommodation. My hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and the hon. Member for Christchurch have referred already to the likely effect of that action, especially on the children of homeless families by their being shifted from pillar to post, perhaps at the time when they are most vulnerable. I am still not clear about the Minister's argument. Let us suppose that a family experience a terrorist attack or a major flood and lose their home with no prospect of its being rebuilt or repaired and, as a result, must move elsewhere. Can that family be housed in permanent accommodation if such accommodation can be found by the local authority? Indeed, should that family be allocated permanent accommodation? The Minister said, "Yes, in some situations, they would be able to be rehoused in permanent accommodation."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>700</span>
However, the two examples the Minister cited, of such action were of people who were already on the housing waiting list and those who were already local authority tenants. He referred to the recent outrages in Docklands. The people who were affected by the attack were council tenants. However, what would have happened if the bomb had exploded elsewhere and affected families had just started out, obtained their mortgages and were struggling to make do? Would such people be allocated permanent accommodation under the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take two extreme examples. First, let us suppose that a household was bombed out in Belgravia. Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that that family, because their house was destroyed, should have subsidised permanent accommodation? 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Gentleman cannot listen to me and to the hon. Member for Greenwich, although I think that he is being given the answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another example is of a family who are on a different income and in a different position from the family in Belgravia, and whose members are unemployed with dependent children. The hon. Gentleman is suggesting that both households should receive the same treatment. I do not agree. If I am bombed out, there is not a prima facie case that I should go into permanent accommodation. There may be some people to whom that applies. It depends on need. That is what the Bill is about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The present legislation takes account of need. The problem is that Ministers seem to have started from the assumption that there must be one route to the allocation of accommodation. Having decided that that is the answer, they have tried to work back to the questions that relate to it. Our argument is that a problem such as homelessness is not easily reducible to a points system. That is not to say that points systems are wrong—most local authorities operate them—but homelessness is a different matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To answer the Minister's question, if someone was bombed out in Belgravia and there was a surplus of accommodation that could be allocated, I should see no reason why it should not be allocated. It is always a question of need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suppose there are two houses alongside each other, not in Belgravia. Both were originally built by a local authority. One is occupied by local authority tenants. The other is occupied by a young couple with children, who are not on any waiting list. They have managed to scrape together the money to buy their starter home. They did not buy it from the council; the people who bought the house have moved out and the young couple have moved in. They are not wealthy, but they are not on a waiting list, because they never envisaged what would happen. The gas main explodes and both houses are destroyed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minster saying that, in those circumstances, the family who are tenants could and should, if accommodation is available, be rehoused on a permanent basis, but the family who are not tenants should not; or is he saying that the question is more complicated than that? If it is more complicated, will he explain to the Committee the criteria that will be applied—in relation to the family's homelessness, not in relation to waiting lists, because they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0398">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>701</span>
are not on a waiting list—to ensure that the second family will be allocate permanent secure accommodation if it is available?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is saying that there is scope for flexibility which Opposition Members cannot see in the Bill, will he make that explicit? It is not clear from the Bill or the accompanying documentation. If it is not made explicit in the Bill, as my hon. Friends have said, it will be a lawyers' paradise. It will encourage them to find exceptions to the single route to housing allocation because the Bill is predicated on the fact that there will be only a single route.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to explore the hon. Gentleman's position. He posed the case of two houses side by side, both previous local authority homes—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One is a previous local authority home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One is a previous local authority home. It is now privately owned. The owners might not be former local authority tenants. The home could have been bought under the right to buy by the previous occupiers. The person in the local authority home was the on-going tenant. The gas main explodes under both houses; that is the circumstance that we both outlined. The local authority will have a duty to rehouse the local authority tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the other person should be housed permanently in local authority stock? Some months later he may receive £40,000 or £50,000 from his insurance for the damage to his house. Should he stay in local authority stock with that insurance money? Is it not reasonable that that person should spend some time in temporary accommodation—the duty is for up to two years—until it is clear whether he can find accommodation in the private sector, which is presumably where he wanted to be? I find it difficult to follow the logic of the hon. Gentleman's argument that local authority accommodation should be available, whatever the circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to tease out from the Minister what will be taken into account. Let us assume that the two families are in identical situation—identical numbers of children of identical ages—and that identical tragedies befall them both when the gas main blows up under the house. If the Minister is saying that the local authority's objective will be to rehouse one family permanently, if possible, but not the other family, at least that will be clear. We might disagree about whether that is a good thing, but at least the position will be clear. However, he has not been saying that. He seems to be saying that there would not be an objective to rehouse the family in permanent accommodation, but that the local authority would check to see whether there were circumstances in which it could be done. I want to know what those circumstances might be if the family were not on the waiting list and not already tenants?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is perfectly clear. If the family are already tenants, they will be rehoused by the local authority. If they are not tenants of the local authority, they will be regarded as homeless under the provisions of
	<span class='label label-info column'>702</span>
the 1977 Act and an interim duty will apply. The local authority will have a duty to provide accommodation for up to two years. During that time, the family, if they wish, can be placed on the housing register and their underlying needs will be considered. The family may receive an insurance payment, giving them a significant asset and allowing them to return to the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am not sure that I like where we are going, but the Minister is becoming a little clearer. It seems that the exceptions that the Minister has suggested will be more illusory than real. When the proposed legislation is operated in practice, the people who are likely to be losers will be those who have not started off in local authority accommodation, but whose needs are identical to those already in such accommodation. I hope that the Minister will think again about the matter because he seems to understand the problems that we have identified. On reflection, I hope that he will consider tabling amendments—they will probably be minor ones—that will address some of the issues that we have raised. I shall sit down now because the Minister is beginning to clarify matters, although the picture that is being painted is not very good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I do not know whether you were present at the Chartered Institute of Housing dinner on Thursday evening when the Minister gave an after-dinner speech. There was very little mention of the Government's housing policy, perhaps because the Minister recognised that the audience would have seen the holes in his arguments. He gave a passable impression of a stand-up comedian.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ministers believe that it is prudent to ascertain the character of the speech that the audience wants. Having done so, I was asked to address myself to the more lighthearted aspects of our policy. As the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before we pursue this topic, I have to listen to hon. Members quite enough in Committee without having to attend dinners to do so. We are talking about homelessness, not after-dinner comedians.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0399">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>703</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely, Mr. McWilliam. I thought that the Minister had given up trying to defend this wretched piece of legislation and was trying to find a new career.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two aspects to the issue on which I want to concentrate and I fully associate myself with the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich. Given the housing situation in the country, the Government's proposal to change the homelessness legislation is unnecessary. Will the Minister explain where local authorities and homeless families will stand if the Bill, in its present form, is enacted and will he tell us the extent to which homeless families will be passed from one address to another on a sort of homeless merry-go-round, which would be socially and educationally damaging?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That arises out of clause 147, not clause 136.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to link the two clauses together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is not possible to link the two clauses. We are debating amendment No. 472—and only that amendment. The hon. Gentlemen can explore the issue under amendments proposed to clause 147, but not under this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to show that the Bill does not help prevent homelessness or give people secure accommodation. The various clauses of part VII do not secure accommodation for the homeless that current legislation would secure for them. My hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich has already alluded to the problem of whether people are given temporary or permanent accommodation. The general requirement under current legislation is that temporary accommodation is provided for a limited time and that permanent accommodation is the norm for those who meet the various tests laid down, both in part VII of the Bill and in previous legislation. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Burden) said that the crucial test was whether the Government now saw temporary accommodation as the norm and permanent accommodation for homeless families as an exception. At present, it is the other way round. Permanent accommodation is the norm for those who meet the requirements of not being intentionally homeless and being in a priority category; temporary accommodation is used during assessment or while waiting for permanent accommodation to become available. That is the difference between existing legislation and part VII of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as we can assess the combined impact of the clauses in part VII, it seems possible that a homeless family could be housed in six different places. If the various clauses are linked together, the family might have to move six times in less than three years. Does the Minister accept that that is feasible? The family start in an existing home; they may then be found accommodation by the local authority under clause 147. The authority may then find that it has no duty to house the family, so they go to live with the in-laws. A review may, then be undertaken, the duty not continuing during that time; but after the review, the local authority may give the family temporary accommodation under clause 151; after those two years, the local authority
	<span class='label label-info column'>704</span>
may not continue to find the family local authority accommodation but may, under clause 161, find them hostel accommodation or leased accommodation. Finally, the family may be rehoused because they have a place on the local authority housing list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I have described, Mr. McWilliam, may be possible if the clauses are linked as I have suggested. A homeless family may find itself in six locations—four of them local authority accommodation—in less than three years. I contend that that is nonsense. The Minister can either tell me that I have got my sums wrong or that I did not find the right route through the various clauses, or he can accept my conclusion. The Government's proposals would be devastating for families and would waste the time of local authorities in having to rehouse such families four times because of the interaction of the various clauses of part VII of the Bill. The fact that the Minister has not intervened shows that what I have said is an accurate reflection of the possible treatment of homeless families under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to discover whether, because of the interaction between the clauses, local authorities will be able to find accommodation for homeless families. The problem is that we have had so many different answers from the Minister. Almost every time we ask a question we get a slightly different answer—slightly different words are used. That is inadequate when we are legislating; we must have something that is absolutely clear, so that local authorities can implement it, so that homeless families know their rights, and so that the courts know where they stand—because the courts will undoubtedly be dragged in, and the clever lawyers to whom my hon. Friend referred will make an awful lot of money out of the Bill, and out of the Minister's words, which will no doubt be quoted in court at some stage to determine what the Bill means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Northfield rightly pursued at some length the issue of families who are bombed out. The Minister will at some stage have to give guidance about that. I do not know what the guidance will be, and from what the Minister has said this morning, I am unclear how he will frame that guidance. When a family becomes homeless through extraordinary circumstances, does it matter what those circumstances are? Is the position different depending on whether they have been bombed out or if they have had a fire or a gas explosion? We have been through all that, but at one stage the Minister seemed to be saying that families in such a situation might—even if they were not local authority tenants—be able to be rehoused immediately, if local authority accommodation were available. Later on, he said that they would of course have to spend a period in temporary accommodation, as provided for under clause 151.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At one point, he said that it would depend on whether the family lived in Belgravia—in other words, he seemed to be bringing a means test to bear. He suggested that if the family were wealthy and had money to provide for themselves the authority would not have a duty to rehouse the family in permanent accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also seemed to suggest that if an individual's house that went up in a gas explosion was insured, the insurance money could provide an alternative
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0400">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>705</span>
home. What would happen if the house was not insured? Would the local authority then have a duty to investigate the circumstances of a family in such a situation to discover whether they could afford to replace their private home with another private home?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of that is covered in the Bill; it is all in the Minister's mind; some of it is now in 	<i>Hansard.</i> None of us is clear what responsibilities local authorities will have to families in such situations. The Minister himself is unclear about that. We need a clear definition of what authorities are able to do in such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I next turn to another issue that my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich pursued, namely families who are nearly at the top of the waiting list. I see that the Minister's legal adviser is now back in the Room. He will have to make the position clearer. I suggest to the Minister that no local authority has a right to say to someone, "Oh yes, you have nearly enough points. Although someone else is higher up the queue than you, we will rehouse you", unless there is specific provision in the local authority's housing allocation policy—which must conform with the Minister's guidance and the Bill—that allows the authority to award extra points to a homeless family in a particular situation. A local authority cannot say simply, "Oh dear, you are in difficult circumstances; you are five points behind the person at the head of the list; we will give you another five points", unless the allocation policy permits the authority to do that. Discretion does not come out of thin air in such circumstances, otherwise authorities would be subject to judicial review. If the Minister takes legal advice, he will find that he must clarify in guidance or in the Bill the statement that he made about adding a few points, or giving people with not quite enough points a home if they are homeless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If local authorities will be allowed to give extra priority, so that someone who is homeless can get enough points to reach the top of the housing queue and—be given permanent accommodation immediately, authorities will be able under their allocations policy to give weighting to homeless families. That is a straightforward statement. If local authorities can do that, will there be any limit on their ability do that? Will the Minister say that a local authority will be able to give only so much weight, so much additional priority? If the local authority itself can determine how much priority it will give, it will have the ability to give permanent accommodation straight away. The Minister must tell us the position, because we have not so far had any clarification, and the matter is crucial to understanding whether homeless families can be offered permanent accommodation straight away and where local authorities will stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister volunteered a statement about the glitches that he said that the Chartered Institute of Housing and discovered. For example a homeless family may have had enough points but their points may have been reduced when they were put into temporary accommodation. So should we assume that points would be deducted if they were put into temporary accommodation, or would they keep the number of points that they already had?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An allocation scheme will have to provide that people who are put into temporary accommodation because they are homeless will not be treated in the same way as other families in temporary accommodation. Special mention will have to be made in the allocation policy of the case of a family who ends up in temporary accommodation
	<span class='label label-info column'>706</span>
because they are homeless. Under the allocation policy, homeless families should be treated differently. The Minister's policy of having one route into temporary accommodation, so that all families are treated exactly the same when they are not the same, is unravelling before his very eyes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must realise that when he says that this or that can be done and local authorities may be able to do this or that to help homeless families, he is reflecting the fact that homeless families have a particular problem and need special treatment, even under a raw allocations policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I put two other points to the Minister, which show the nonsense and stupidity of the legislation as it is currently framed? Last week we discussed the other end of the equation: how the allocations policy deals with homeless people. This morning we are dealing with how homeless people fit into the allocations policy. The Minister said that the allocations criteria in the Bill will enable particular weight to be given to people with temporary or insecure tenure. So homeless families housed in temporary accommodation could get extra points on the waiting list, as do other families in temporary accommodation. If a family is offered temporary accommodation, would the mere offer of the accommodation and the family's acceptance of it be sufficient to give them the points, which may mean that they would have enough points to be given permanent accommodation straightaway? The family may not need to move into that temporary accommodation to get the necessary points. If people could get into permanent accommodation without ever moving into temporary accommodation, that would be a massive loophole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week I referred to people living in unsatisfactory housing conditions. It was accepted that that could be given weight so that those people could be given priority under a local authority allocation scheme. I asked whether homeless families would be considered to be in unsatisfactory housing. The Minister said that 50 years of case law seemed to deny that possibility. I put it to the Minister that there is another perverse possibility. Is he saying that the allocations policy makes no specific provision for a homeless family with no home at all to be housed permanently? My hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich referred to the Pullhoffer judgment and the resultant amendment to the Housing and Planning Act 1986, which provided that a family could be homeless even if they had accommodation provided that it was unreasonable for them to continue to live in that accommodation. Will the Minister confirm that if it were unreasonable for a family to continue to live in their present accommodation, they would be technically homeless, even under the definitions in the Bill, and would be considered to be living in unsatisfactory housing conditions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister accepted that that was one of the reasons for giving a family priority for allocation of accommodation, a family living in accommodation that it was unreasonable for them to continue to live in could be housed directly under the allocations policy because they would be considered to be living in unsatisfactory housing conditions, but a homeless family that had no home at all could not be housed under the same allocations policy. Both families would be defined as homeless: one family could be rehoused under the allocations policy and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0401">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>707</span>
other family could not. That is the sort of nonsense that we are encountering. The Minister must unravel it during our deliberations about this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I began my remarks by saying that the Minister would do rather well as a stand-up comedian. The problem is that this section of the Bill is degenerating into farce. Homeless families and local authorities do not deserve that. I hope that the Minister will do something to resolve some of the dilemmas and difficulties that have been described and that he will fix some of the enormous holes that have appeared in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are one or two matters that I want to cover. Many more will arise in the discussions to come, and I shall not rehearse the arguments about the circumstances in which people may be bombed out. The provisions for going straight into permanent housing are not new. There is nothing new in the Bill or in any consultation paper to suggest that homeless households could not go straight into permanent accommodation under the circumstances mentioned in what the Committee has come to know as the Laird protocol.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition seems to believe that any incidence of homelessness automatically warrants a lifelong local authority or housing association tenancy. I do not subscribe to that. It makes far more sense to allocate long-term social housing to households in the greatest underlying housing need. That need has to be assessed by putting all applicants on the housing list. I do not think that the Opposition has demonstrated what is wrong with the idea of giving genuinely homeless households accommodation for two years and to assess objectively and sensibly their needs for a council or housing association tenancy. That must be better than an automatic response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not alone in that belief.
	<br><blockquote><p>"We need … a housing waiting list structure that positively rewards those who have tried their best to take responsibility and have some order in their lives … a stable relationship before having children. We need to encourage them rather than punish other people. They need to know it's worth waiting … People … are not fools. If you can't get a house by waiting on the list, you present the maximum number of reasons why you should receive priority. That is not encouraging people to accept responsibility in their own lives and society".</p></blockquote>
So said the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett).
	<br><blockquote><p>"Without changing the legislation, there is a need for policy guidelines to change … It is an unacceptable position that a first time tenant, whether they are a conventional two children, married family, a single mum with three children or a single person with mental illness, goes … to what may, in many cases, be brand new housing stock, when over the other side of the road are people who have been overcrowded for thirty years, paid their rent on time and cannot be moved."</p></blockquote>
That was said by the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady effectively accused me of being on some kind of moral crusade against unmarried mothers. The phrase she used was "queue jumping". I have never used that phrase, or turned the matter into a moral debate, and I do not intend to do so now. I want to identify underlying needs. Whether those needs
	<span class='label label-info column'>708</span>
arose through foolishness or accident is not a question for me and cannot be defined in legislation. The problem is how to identify those needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Greenwich has not answered my earlier question, so I hope that the hon. Member for Christchurch will. The hon Lady said the she opposed the recent cuts in the Housing Corporation budget, but will her party restore those cuts? If so, will it return spending to 1994–95 levels, or 1993–94 levels? All of us have skated around the question of costs, but that question is important and germane. Choices must be made as there is great competition for public expenditure. I want a clearer idea of what the Opposition parties, which emphasise supply, consider an appropriate level of expenditure on housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister raised three questions that he wants answering. I share the disquiet of the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey. The problem is the lack of supply. I have not personally accused the Minister of scapegoating single mothers. He has made it clear that that is not his agenda. My question was about evidence of queue jumping, which no one suggests is restricted to single mothers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister asked about housing costs. I have opposed cuts in the previous two Budgets, as I said in my speech earlier. If those cuts had not been made, investment in social housing would not have been halved. The budgets that we proposed at the time covered the requisite provisions in the Bill. We have done that year on year, as the Minister will find if he looks at 	<i>Hansard.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions should be interventions. That was rather long for an intervention and the hon. Lady should bear that in mind when she next catches my eye.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for clarifying the intent of her remarks about queue-jumping. I am glad that we can settle that issue. My question was about costs. To oppose cuts is one thing, as is opposition to legislation. The relevant questions, however, are whether she would restore the cuts and whether she would repeal or restore the legislation. Those are the questions that I put to her.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts), under existing legislation it is possible to have a merry-go-round in housing—from an application, into bed and breakfast, from an interim duty, into a local authority hostel, into a private sector leased house, into a second private sector leased house, into a council house and so forth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can always adduce the worst possible scenario under any existing legislation, but the question is whether it will arise in practice in the hands of a sensitive local authority. Multiple placements in temporary accommodation are found only in about a quarter of local authorities, especially in the London authorities, under present legislation. I am not going to prescribe exactly what all local authorities should do. There are 300-odd forms of waiting list in the country and I will not apply a single prescriptive formula for every one of them. Rather, I want to set the framework in which they should be defined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We have spent a very long time debating an amendment which the hon. Member for Greenwich did not move. It has served as a Second Reading debate on an issue which I acknowledge to be important. I hope that it has helped the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Since the black hole judgement, an hon. Member is deemed to have moved an amendment the minute he starts speaking to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just to reassure the Minister, lest he be worried about disappearing into a black hole, I have every intention of moving the amendment and pressing it to a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's position outlined this morning is untenable. They are failing to address the key issue—the supple of affordable housing. They are instead trying to dampen down demand by reducing the capacity of local authorities to provide permanent accommodation for homeless people. They are undermining a sensible statutory framework that has been in existence for 19 years, has ensured relief and help to millions of homeless families and is widely accepted as working well. That is an unnecessary and ill-considered act of vandalism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are proposing a series of measures that will create anomalies galore. Many of my hon. Friends have highlighted the extraordinary circumstances that will arise when people are deemed to qualify or not to qualify for permanent rehousing, simply through personal accident or chance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our objection is not, as the Minister seemed to imply, that people who are well capable of finding permanent housing for themselves should not be put automatically into permanent council housing. We fully accept that it is right for someone who is temporarily homeless and who will look to rehouse him or herself through house purchase in due course should be assisted only temporarily. We strongly object, however, to the Government's creation of a framework that will prevent a local authority from housing permanently people who need permanent housing. That is our objection to their proposals. The Government are wrong. They are condemned by the overwhelming weight of informed opinion, as well as the overwhelming weight of opinion of those people who care about homelessness. We will therefore press the amendment to a division and I hope that we will manage, in due course, to retrieve something from this sad mess.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Brooke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of London and Westminster, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 441, in page 72, line 20, after 'available' insert, 'however temporary,'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment and debate on it will be much briefer than on the previous amendment. The Green Paper on access to local authority and housing association tenancies, which was published in January 1994, proposed that a local authority would not be under a duty to provide accommodation to a person who had any form of accommodation available. My amendment would add "however temporary" to the end of that sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amended wording would bring a local authority's duty to all applicants in line with that to asylum seekers, as set out in the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993. I assume that that was the rationale and logic behind the Green Paper's wording, so why did the Government resile from it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We canvassed the possibility of adopting that position in the January 1994 consultation paper. The difficulty was that it put the test of becoming homeless far out of line with the duty that is subsequently owed to someone when he is accepted as homeless. A person would have to be roofless to become entitled to two years of accommodation guaranteed by the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would also pose practical problems for bodies in the voluntary sector, which do an important and valuable job in providing immediate shelter for people who would otherwise be literally without shelter in a crisis. Under my right hon. Friend's amendment, anyone in such a shelter would have no entitlement to more settled accommodation, so the hostels and shelters would be in real danger of silting up. I am aware of my right hon. Friend's interest in such problems and am sure that he would not want that to happen. That is why we felt that we needed to shift from the position that we had canvassed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a welcome statement. My main concern was that we would go back to pre-1977 legislation, under which people were required to return to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0403">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>711</span>
the place that they had occupied the night before, regardless of the threats that they faced there. I am pleased that the Minister agrees with the Minister who was in office when the Green Paper was published. Like the Minister, I am concerned about hostels and particularly about women's refuges. If the Minister had accepted the amendment, he would have created many problems for much extremely good accommodation, which helps people who are in various difficulties and particularly those who seek to escape violence. I welcome the Minister's statement and oppose the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said when I moved that amendment that it was a probing amendment, and I am grateful to my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 449, in page 72, line 21, leave out 'or elsewhere'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under part III of the Housing Act 1985, a person is homeless if he has no accommodation in England, Scotland or Wales. The Bill would extend that definition to the rest of the United Kingdom and elsewhere. The Government apparently want to dampen down anxieties about people who come from abroad to seek housing when they have adequate accommodation elsewhere. There is, however, little evidence of people doing that. Existing legislation includes a test of intentionality, which covers someone from abroad who has left home without making adequate arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[MR. CLIVE BETTS 	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, my hon. Friends and organisations that support the amendment are concerned that the clause could impact on people with family connections outside the United Kingdom, but who have lived and worked here for many years and whose children were born here. Black and ethnic minority applicants are likely to be affected far more than anybody else so the measure would become racially discriminatory. The existing rules on intentionality adequately cover the scenario in which people come from abroad without making adequate arrangements. They are applied to all applicants, and, as I understand it, will remain under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department of the Environment has done research on homeless applicants this year, and only three per cent. were found to be intentionally homeless. There is little evidence of a level of abuse that would make the measure necessary. I hope that the Minister will recognise that, Mr. McWilliam—I am sorry—Mr. Betts. We and many other organisations believe that the provision could be discriminatory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. JOHN MCWILLIAM 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would insert a territorial qualification into the definition of homelessness, although no such definition existed in the 1977 Act. Although it is not widely applied, the definition's appearance in the 1985 Act has proved unhelpful. There is no reason why someone who has voluntarily left accommodation in another country in which he or she could have continued to live should be regarded as homeless for the purposes of domestic legislation. I am sure that you will recall,
	<span class='label label-info column'>712</span>
Mr. Betts—sorry—Mr. McWilliam—that there were press reports last month of a woman of dual nationality who have been given a grant under the Department-sponsored cash incentive scheme which she used to buy a house in her country of origin. We have since stopped that rule. She lived there for a while but then returned to Britain and subsequently presented herself as homeless. The High Court found that she was owed a duty under the homelessness legislation, a decision which the local authority—Camden, I believe—clearly found somewhat bizarre. We accept that the local authority has a duty to someone returning from abroad who has been made homeless there unintentionally, but we do not accept that someone with property overseas should be able to rely on the homelessness legislation to gain a second address in Britain. Therefore, I want to resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that the clause will create more jobs for lawyers. I am surprised that the High Court took the decision mentioned by the Minister because the woman appeared to be intentionally homeless. If the Minister is saying that the clause will deal with such a case, I am still disturbed. Will he examine the wording to ensure that cases such as the ones I mentioned will not be tied up in the legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to give the hon. Lady that assurance. I will examine the clause to ensure that the purposes it is intended to serve are, indeed, served.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>MEANING OF ACCOMMODATION AVAILABLE FOR OCCUPATION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 477, in page 72, line 33, leave out from second 'occupation' to end of line 35 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'both by him and by any other person who might reasonably be expected to reside with him.'.</p></blockquote>
Clause 137 deals with the definition of accommodation. Subsection (2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Accommodation shall be regarded as available for a person's occupation only if it is available for occupation by him together with any other person who normally resides with him as a member of his family or in circumstances in which it is reasonable for that person to reside with him."</p></blockquote>
The amendment would change the subsection to read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Accommodation shall be regarded as available for a person's occupation only if it is available for occupation both by him and by any other person who might reasonably be expected to reside with him."</p></blockquote>
There are three reasons for the amendment. First, it makes a simpler and clearer statement of intention. Instead of the rather long-winded and slightly tortuous structure of the legislation as drafted, the amendment provides a more straightforward and understandable formulation. In the interests of making legislation easier to understand, the amendment represents an advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0404">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>713</span>
Secondly, the amendment allows for people who normally live together to be accommodated together if they are homeless—I should have thought that that should be our objective. That is why we chose the wording
	<br><blockquote><p>"available for occupation both by him and by any other person who might reasonably be expected to reside with him."</p></blockquote>
Thirdly, the amendment makes allowance for circumstances in which people are not currently living together, but might reasonably be expected to. There are cases, especially where marital breakdowns have occurred and children spend a certain amount of time with each parent, where it is reasonable for the parent who does not have custody of the children but who wants to be able to accommodate them, to be able to do so. The amendment would allow for that, whereas it might be more difficult under the existing definitions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to create a simpler and better terminology to provide for people who normally live together to be treated as such in the legislation and to cope with circumstances in which people do not currently live together but might reasonably want a member of their family—someone to whom they are closely related—to be able to be accommodated with them. We think that the measure is sensible and humane and I hope that the Minister will be accommodating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause defines when accommodation is available for a person's occupation. The amendment alters the definition of availability and refers simply to accommodation being available for occupation by the person
	<br><blockquote><p>"and by any other person who might reasonably be expected to reside with him."</p></blockquote>
The amendment is unnecessary. As drafted, the clause already provides what the amendment seeks: that accommodation must be available not only to the applicant but to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any other person who normally resides with him..in circumstances in which it is reasonable for that person to reside with him"</p></blockquote>
for it to be regarded as available for the applicant's occupation. The amendment would also remove reference to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any other person who normally resides with him as a member of his family".</p></blockquote>
It would be undesirable for those words to disappear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has explained his amendment and I shall examine the text of the guidance that flows from it. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept my assurance that I will check whether he has spotted something that might not be possible but which we all agree we would like.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his offer; the only reason that we propose to remove
	<br><blockquote><p>"normally resides with him as a member of his family"</p></blockquote>
is that it is easier to bring the two similar definitions in the subsection together in a single formulation that describes people who might reasonably be expected to reside together. We do not express any view about the merits or otherwise of living together in a family; given the speculation about how far that policy may be driving the legislation, I do not intend to do down that route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>714</span>
I hope that the Minister will examine the issue, which is a genuine one, and will return to us if he feels that there is a problem. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 474, in page 72, line 37, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(a) in the case of a tenancy he is unable to comply with terms of the grant of the tenancy at the time of the grant and where it is reasonably to be expected that he would comply with those terms having regard to such assistance as he may have received under this Part,'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 520, in clause 155, page 81, line 12, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(2A) Accommodation shall not be regarded as available if the applicant is unable to comply with the terms of the grant of the tenancy at the time of the grant and where it is reasonably to be expected that he would comply with those terms having regard to such assistance as he may have received under this part.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is intended to add a condition to the definition of accommodation being available for occupation and to provide that accommodation is considered available only if conditions are not attached to the granting of a tenancy in terms of the amount of a deposit of rent payable in advance which is such that the applicant cannot pay the sum involved and is unable to take up the tenancy. The amendments are attached to the definition in clause 137 on homelessness and the meaning of accommodation available for occupation and to the definition in clause 155 of other suitable accommodation being available for occupation, which relieves the local authority of responsibility for providing accommodation for a homeless family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much evidence above the issue. Shelter has provided me with information about a woman who was offered a tenancy, but who was asked to pay £400 deposit and £400 in advance rent. Most people in such situations could not meet those payments so that, to all intents and purposes, the accommodation would not be available to them. Eighty per cent. of people who find themselves homeless are on housing benefit and if a large deposit or a large advance rental payment were required, that accommodation would effectively be unavailable for their occupation. The amendments would encourage local authorities to develop rental deposit schemes—we shall discuss that issue later—for individuals wanting to rent from the private sector. That would enable them to get round the prohibitive conditions. The amendments are important and I hope that the Minister will respond positively to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the concerns expressed by Opposition Members through amendment No. 474. It clearly would be wrong to assume that someone could continue to occupy accommodation and, thereby, not be considered homeless if he could not meet the terms on which the tenancy was granted. An example of that would be when the person could no longer meet the rent and the rent charged was above the local reference rent for that type of property, with the result that housing benefit would not necessarily cover it all. The local authority has discretion within limits to top up the benefit, but may decide that that is not appropriate in the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0405">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>715</span>
The order-making power under clause 138 will allow us to deal with such cases. We are still reflecting on precisely how to use such a power and the range of cases that it should cover. We shall want to know the views of local authority associations about it. If the hon. Gentleman will withdraw amendment No.474, I shall be happy to consider the points that he made on how the power should be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, I have sympathy with amendment No. 520. We agree that the applicant should not be directed to alternative accommodation when he cannot meet the terms of the tenancy. Again, an obvious case would be one in which he could not meet the rent because it was above the local reference rent. That could mean that housing benefit was not necessarily payable in full. The local authority would then have to use its discretion to top up, although it might not do so. We are considering whether it is necessary to use the order-making power in clause 162 to put the matter beyond doubt by specifying that such accommodation is not suitable. The hon. Gentleman and the Government are basically at one on that underlying point so I ask him to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is another sensible, practical amendment, which I hope will receive a similarly sympathetic response. It deals with circumstances in which people have been forced to leave their homes or who are terrified of staying there because of threats of violence. The Bill makes provision in the case of domestic violence from someone else who is living in the property. The words used are "residing in it". Our amendment seeks to remove those words from the clause so that it covers situations faced by people who are driven out of their home, for example, by a former partner, who no longer lives there but who still terrorises the partner who remains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment is accepted, the clause will also cover people who face appalling problems of harassment from anti-social neighbours or who suffer racial harassment, and whose lives are made a misery because of the threatening activities of racists. The amendments seek to remove from the clause the words "residing in it", so that it reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is not reasonable for a person to continue to occupy accommodation if it is probable that occupation of it will lead to violence from some other person or to threats of violence from some other person likely to carry out the threats."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>716</span>
The amendment is sensible. I hope that its purpose is obvious and that the Minister can accommodate us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the concerns behind the amendments and share the revulsion of Opposition Members for such violence. We must consider whether the solution to the problems that people experience outside the home lies in extending the Bill. It is reasonable to define what a housing authority can cope with, but how wide can we go and still regard it as reasonable for a housing authority to cope with? It is long established in case law that local authorities must take into account whether an appellant under the homelessness legislation has been subject to violence or threats of violence outside the home. Our recent research report, "An evaluation of the 1991 homelessness code of guidance", shows that 70 per cent. of authorities would usually consider an applicant homeless in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Authorities will continue to have discretion to take account of violence outside the home. I will consider whether we can strengthen the guidance to local authorities in the light of that research. I am anxious to ensure that we can allow local authorities discretion to assess each situation as it arises, so that they can identify cases of real need, providing support for those with no other way out, and helping people to consider other solutions, where possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the hon. Gentleman to allow me the latitude to see to what extent we can deal with the matter effectively through the mechanism of the guidance, and to give much clearer assistance to local authorities in pursuing a course of action that more than two thirds of them already regard as sensible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that helpful response. I should point out that as the Bill is currently drafted, there may be difficulties for local authorities as it specifically refers to violence or threats of violence from someone residing in the home. As Members of Parliament, we are all familiar from our constituency surgeries with cases of people whose partners no longer reside in the home, but unfortunately do not keep away. They come back and threaten, and in some cases commit, acts of violence. We are anxious to cover those circumstances, as well as the others that I have described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will look into the matter. If he believes that the current wording of clause 138 is restrictive and would prevent such cases from being accommodated, I am sure that he will table an amendment on Report, which we will be happy to facilitate.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will bear with me if I take a little longer over these two amendments, as they are slightly more substantial amendments which try to define circumstances in which it is not reasonable for people to continue to occupy accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 478 deals with circumstances in which the result of people continuing to occupy the accommodation would be statutory overcrowding. Amendment No. 479 deals with circumstances in which people are facing possession proceedings against which they have no defence, so no good purpose is served by their continuing to occupy the accommodation. I will outline briefly the reasons why the amendments are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition of overcrowding is provided in the Housing Act 1985. It would be helpful to the Committee if I spelt out how extraordinarily overcrowded people must be in order to be defined as statutorily overcrowded. Two standards—the room standard and the space standard—operate. To be overcrowded under the room standard, more than one person of the opposite sex, must occupy a bedroom. All children under the age of 10 are excluded from the equation and both bedrooms and living rooms are included as rooms in which people can sleep. Consequently, you could have 10 children sleeping in one room and—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have two children, not 10.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. McWilliam, for correcting me. You, with your two children, would certainly not be statutorily overcrowded, but another household with 10 children sleeping in one room would not be deemed to be statutorily overcrowded. It is not a loose test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The space standard defines the number of persons who can be expected to live together in one room. If there are two people, they must have one room; three people need two rooms; five people need three rooms; and seven and a half people must have four rooms. Children under the age of one are excluded entirely; children between the ages of one and 10 count as only half a person; and all living rooms and bedrooms count as rooms. A family comprising two adults and six children aged between one and nine would not be overcrowded statutorily, even if they were living in a two-bedroom property. I mention that to stress that the overcrowding standard is very extreme. If people fall into the category of being statutorily overcrowded, it means that they are not leading a normal human life. On any test of reasonableness, it is not acceptable to expect them to continue to occupy such accommodation. That is the purpose of our amendment No. 478.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 479 deals with circumstances in which people are living in accommodation for which the landlord is seeking possession, against which they have no defence. Despite guidance from the Department
	<span class='label label-info column'>718</span>
suggesting that local authorities should be helpful when responding to such circumstances, sadly, some local authorities insist on the people staying in the accommodation until the bitter end, when possession proceedings have gone through the courts and bailiffs have been summoned and executed a warrant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are all sorts of potential problems, some of which have been highlighted in briefings from the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. It knows of many distressing cases, one of which involved an elderly couple in Essex. They are in their sixties and were given two months' notice to quit after having lived for a year in an assured shorthold tenancy. They had lived in that assured shorthold tenancy for a period that took them beyond its duration, so they had no defence at all against possession, but despite that, the council refused to accept them as homeless without the matter going through the courts. That upset the couple enormously because they became involved in unnecessarily bad relations with their landlord and were forced to incur significant expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are good grounds for not requiring people who have no defence against a possession order to go through all the processes of the law. That is a bad policy, not only in terms of its impact on the people involved, but for the courts. It increases the load on court business without furthering the cause of justice. At a time when Lord Justice Woolf has undertaken a detailed review of the issue, I should hope that all members of the Committee would regard it as sensible to avoid burdening the courts with unnecessary cases when there is no possibility of an outcome other than possession being granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, we believe that the amendments are necessary as they would define additional circumstances in which people would not be regarded as expected to continue to live in certain accommodation. The first amendment deals with overcrowding and the second refers to tenants who are subject to possession proceedings but who have no defence against such proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Overcrowding is already one of the factors to which a local authority must have regard when deciding whether it owes a household a duty under the homelessness legislation. Indeed, the courts have held that an authority cannot refuse to consider an application on the grounds of overcrowding from a household not otherwise at risk of losing its accommodation. The homelessness legislation is a vehicle for assisting people faced with the immediate prospect of losing their accommodation, rather than for addressing more general issues of housing quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 478 would open the way to applications from a far wider range of cases, including owner-occupiers who had outgrown their present accommodation. There is a real issue of housing supply that we have to address in the context of the projected growth in the number of households over the next decade, but I doubt whether the Committee is the place to do it. I assure the hon. Member for Greenwich that in operating the homelessness legislation, local authorities will be obliged to continue to take proper account of overcrowding, alongside a range of other factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The homelessness code of guidance makes it clear that authorities should not require applicants to fight possession proceedings when there is no chance of

	<span class='label label-info column'>719</span>
success before accepting that a household is being threatened with homelessness. Indeed, our study shows that about 94 per cent. of authorities would take a notice to quit or notice of seeking possession as evidence of impending homelessness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am doubtful that we want what amendment No. 479 proposes. There are many different forms of tenancy and grounds for possession; and there are many defences that can apply in particular cases that are both technical—the proper service of notices—and substantive. Given that existing arrangements are shown to be working well—we can reinforce the point when we issue the new guidance, and I would certainly be willing to do so—I would not want to introduce a new requirement, which, at the margin in a difficult case, would require the local authority to anticipate the courts' decision. I hope that that is of some help to the hon. Gentleman, but I cannot accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that it is that much help. I acknowledge that the guidance already exists but, unfortunately, it is not always followed. I hardly think that the Lord Chancellor's Department will be pleased at the prospect of more people clogging up the courts simply because they are required to do so by those authorities that do not follow the guidance. We tabled the amendment so that there would be no doubt about the matter, so I am disappointed by the Minister's response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there is already a framework in which local authorities can have regard to overcrowding. The Minister conjured up the frightening prospect of large numbers of people applying for housing on the grounds of overcrowding, but he need only remember the figures that I gave on the extent of overcrowding that must exist to satisfy the conditions of the Housing Act 1985 to realise that only a small number of people would fall into that category, as the test is extreme. I am disappointed that the Minister was not more flexible, but as time is pressing and we want to make progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 539, in page 73, line 11, leave out 'reasonable or'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss amendment No. 534, in page 73, leave out lines 13 to 15.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 138 sets out the circumstances in which it would be reasonable for a person to continue to occupy accommodation, and we have considered that in our discussions on other amendments. Amendments Nos. 539 and 534 have a similar intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>720</span>
Despite some drafting amendments, the clause restates existing law, and establishes a wider range of circumstances in which a person may be regarded as having no accommodation and therefore homeless. On a test of reasonableness, authorities may have regard to general housing circumstances in their district, but they may also consider the code of guidance, which we have discussed, particularly in relation to overcrowding, although other factors could be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause states that the Secretary of State may specify by order
	<br><blockquote><p>"other circumstances in which it is to be regarded as reasonable or not reasonable for a person to occupy accommodation".</p></blockquote>
That gives more power to central Government, which is one of the reasons why I oppose it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A case law has developed, it has confirmed that, under current legislation, local authorities should consider a number of factors in deciding whether it is reasonable for a person to continue to occupy accommodation. The Secretary of State's powers under clause 138 will allow central Government to decide when local authorities should or should not apply the courts' decisions, so that central Government could easily overturn judge-made law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 539 would make that impossible, so that case law would stand and local authorities would make their decisions in line with it. It would be a positive step forward if the Minister were to take that on board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already referred to the possibility of our using the power to put beyond reasonable doubt that a person reliant on housing benefit can be expected to continue occupation only if the rent can be covered by the housing benefit available. That is what we would use our order-making powers to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power will also allow the Secretary of State to clarify the law where a court decision in a particular case causes him to question what a particular provision means in the general understanding of how the system is supposed to operate. That was effected by the amendments to the legislation by the Housing and Planning Act 1986, several years after the initial court decision that such clarification was needed. The power will enable us to move more quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 539 would ensure that case law alone determines how provisions can be used. I understand that view. However, there have been cases in which the decisions of the courts have placed unexpectedly broad interpretation, and have imposed a consequent burden on local authorities before being overturned on appeal. We need to be able to act on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
