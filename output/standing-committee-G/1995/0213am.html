	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Vaz 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leicester, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 118, in page 5, line 25, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(2A) Consent given under this section, except to a particular landlord or in relation to particular land, may be varied by the Corporation by order under the seal of the Corporation.'.</p></blockquote>
This is a simple, technical amendment. It would make it clear in the Bill that the Housing Corporation can vary its assent to the disposal of ground when that consent is given. Clause 8 gives the Housing Corporation power to consent to the disposal of land by registered social landlords, either on a case-by-case basis or more generally. The amendment would allow the corporation to vary that consent when it refers to all registered social landlords, a type of social landlord or a type of land. Although the Minister may say that it is clear that the Housing Corporation can do that, we consider it important that such a measure should be outlined in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some members of the Committee have told me that the Room is a bit warm, so it is in order for hon. Members to remove their jackets if they wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration (Mr. David Curry)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz) rightly anticipated my response. Clause 8 provides that the corporation's consent is required for a disposal. That may be given generally or it may be more specific. In practice, the corporation issues a general consent. Providing that landlords conform to the terms of that consent, they can dispose of property by means of sale, lease, mortgage, charge or any other disposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The corporation can, and does, vary the general consent. It updates it from time to time and issues the consent in the form of a circular. The most recent variation dates from last year. The amendment proposes that the corporation may vary a general consent. It is unnecessary as clause 8 follows the current legislation, which has proved adequate. I invite the hon. Gentleman not to persist with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>RIGHT OF TENANT TO ACQUIRE DWELLING</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Diana Maddock 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 121, in page 10, line 15, at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>'except that in section 119 (1) of that Part for the purposes of this section only the words after "period" shall be deleted and there shall instead be inserted the words "of residence in the dwelling of which he is a tenant of at least two years.".'.</p></blockquote>
Under subsection (1)(c), a tenant has the right to acquire his dwelling if he has been a public sector tenant for at least two years. The amendment would mean that the tenant would have that right if he had been resident in his current dwelling for at least two years. Under the right-to-buy legislation, tenants who would not otherwise have the right to buy their dwellings must have been public sector tenants for at least two years. The Government are introducing the purchase grant to help tenants of registered social landlords who wish to purchase the homes in which they live rather than other dwellings on the private market. Over time, people become attached to their homes and may prefer to buy them rather than other dwellings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That argument is less strong for tenants who have recently moved into their homes, especially those eligible for the purchase grant. They will probably be the newest of the housing association stock and the amount of help needed to buy property will depend on the length of tenure. A tenant may have moved into a brand new housing association house. If that person had been a tenant of other public sector housing for at least two years, he could immediately receive the maximum grant to buy a home. It is considered by some that there is an increased risk of fraud in such circumstances, including the allocation of new property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another risk is that the purchaser may move again as soon as the repayment of discount no longer applies. To minimise that and to ensure that the purchase grant favours long-standing tenants committed to owning their present homes, tenants should be required to have been resident in the home that they want to buy at least two years to qualify for the purchase grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government may say that the purchase grant legislation should closely model existing right-to-buy legislation and that there is no need to depart from it. They may also say that if tenants did not already have a right to buy, it might be at least two years before they could benefit from the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new scheme is rather different from the original right to buy, which was introduced for settled tenants of local authorities or housing associations. Housing association schemes introduced since the Housing Act 1988 do not have eligible dwellings, and local authorities built few properties during the 1980s. Moreover, the purchase grant discount is not related to length of tenure, so tenants in new social landlord dwellings gain no advantage in delaying their purchase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, many properties will be purchased for more than their current value because they are relatively new. Much effort has been expended in recent years to create rented dwellings in the social sector. Many fear that early sales would defeat the objectives of much of that work—work done at considerable cost to public funds and to housing association time. Indeed, if the grant injections were small, the associations could make a loss.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interested to the hon. Lady. Does she accept that when local authority houses were being built in the 1980s, it was possible under the right-to-buy scheme for local authority tenants to move into new properties yet still claim die right to buy because they had been local authority tenants in other properties? The danger in the hon. Lady's proposal is that if, in future, housing association tenants move from properties built in line with current proposals to new properties, no benefit will have accrued to them from their previous tenancies and they would not be eligible to buy. Under the amendment, they would gain mobility but lose the right to buy. That scheme would therefore discourage mobility among housing association tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I let the hon. Gentleman go on a bit, but interventions should be just that, not speeches. I am quite happy to call anyone who catches my eye.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but the problem is that some houses will not have been available to tenants under the right-to-buy scheme. What I propose would be transitional, because the Government's rather optimistic estimate is that 1,200 tenants will take part in the scheme in the next few years. I am worried that there may be a rapid loss of social housing while the change is being made. The amendment seeks to minimise that loss, because of the already decreasing supply of social housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will make my speech now, Mr. McWilliam, and I apologise for trying to make it previously. I have some sympathy with the objective of the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock) to ensure a proper and ready supply of affordable housing. We share that objective and would not want in any way to worsen the situation. We also understand concerns about abuse of the system that could mean that the organisation providing property would lose out financially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to my intervention, the hon. Lady said that that problem might exist for a while, but that as the scheme matured there might be other ways to deal with it. I suggest that the problem she raised of the lack of affordable housing should be addressed in relation to the resources available for the provision of such housing, rather than in relation to the rights of individuals who move into a new house covered by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of the potential loss to an organisation—if a tenant moves into a brand new property, purchases it and the landlord's receipts from the sale do not meet the cost of providing a replacement property—is one for discussion under a different part of the Bill. We will want to question the Minister later about what financial compensation for sales will be provided for landlords under the Bill and about future regulations. We must ensure that, where there is a continuing housing need in an area in which a house is sold, there will be sufficient assets for the association to provide a replacement property to meet the needs of people who wish to rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said in my intervention, I am worried that the amendment would disadvantage tenants by restricting their mobility. It would put them at a disadvantage compared with local authority tenants, who have the right to buy on the basis of their tenure not merely in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>76</span>
existing property but under previous tenancies. I recognise that it is difficult to replicate absolutely the local authority right-to-buy scheme for the dwellings that we are discussing, but the amendment would put tenants of those properties at considerable disadvantage compared with local authority tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the hon. Lady's concerns about resources being available to associations to replace properties, but that is something that can be dealt with elsewhere in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not often find myself in agreement with the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts)—at least in open debate—I hope that this will not prove too catching, but in this instance I agree with what he said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful if I make the briefest of introductions to the clause, which will introduce a new right to buy for tenants of registered social landlords. It deals exclusively with property that is yet to be built. The extension of the right to buy to existing property does not have to be achieved through primary legislation. It may be useful if the Committee keeps that distinction in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1980, the Government introduced legislation that gave tenants of local authorities and non-charitable housing associations the right to buy their home. When the Housing Act 1988 introduced assured tenancies for housing association tenants, those tenants did not have the right to buy, because private finance was being used alongside public funding to build those properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now propose to give a new right to purchase future grant-aided stock to tenants of registered social landlords—to be precise about what is covered by the provision. From April next year, we shall also introduce a voluntary scheme for associations' existing stock. About 120 associations have already bid for grant. In the conditions that we have set, we have sought to meet the concerns of housing associations—I think that we have substantially done so. We have deliberately set out to be flexible and to appreciate the concerns of housing associations in London, for example, and I think that people are generally satisfied that we have achieved that objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the heart of the Bill is an attempt to model the housing association right on the right to buy covering existing local authority property—precisely for the reason that the hon. Member for Attercliffe mentioned: we want to maintain an equivalence of rights. That cannot apply in every corner of the Bill, as will become apparent, but it should apply where there is an equivalent situation. We could justify to tenants the more stringent test which the amendment would introduce that the tenant must have spent at least two years in the property he wants to buy. Why should tenants with the new right have to meet stricter criteria than those who have enjoyed the right to buy for the past 15 years?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the concern behind the amendment is the prospect of a tenant moving into a newly built property and applying to buy straight away, when the market value might be less than the development cost. That is not likely to be a common event for obvious reasons. When a sale takes place, the purchase grant and social housing grant that the housing association has received will protect against outright loss. The amount of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0051">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>77</span>
the receipt that can be placed in the ring-fenced fund might not be enough to replace like with like in such a situation, although the receipt should be enough to buy a similar existing property because the association will have received the full market value. However, not all sales fall into that category and, over time, costs and receipts should balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point about mobility made by the hon. Member for Attercliffe is important. There would be problems—they would not be enormous, but would clearly exist. There is a certain dislocation in the amendment. We want to facilitate the movement of tenants in the public sector. I understand the worries of the hon. Member for Christchurch, but believe that the principle of alignment with the right to buy, except when there is an obvious reason that it should be different, is correct. I invite the hon. Lady to withdraw the amendment. If she wants to persist, I must advise the Committee to vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome Minister's comments. They have highlighted the concern we all have about what might happen to social rented stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To answer the points made by the hon. Member for Attercliffe, one of the problems is that, under local authorities, the funding of local authority housing over many years has been different from what we are proposing. The amendment's purpose is to highlight the problems that housing associations might still have, despite the Minister's comments, when properties are sold off: they will lose money. However, because the point has been highlighted, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While moving amendment No. 131, I shall speak to the other amendments and new clause 4. They go to the heart of the problems with and the discussions about this part of the Bill, which gives the right to buy to housing association tenants. There are clear divisions between myself, the Minister and the hon. Member for Leicester, East.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We propose to give local authorities, as opposed to the Minister, the right to take a decision about the appropriateness of the right to buy for any particular area. There was a debate in the House yesterday concerning that matter and, as a Liberal Democrat, I believe very much in local democracy and giving as much decision-making power as possible to local areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends and I, and most housing associations, are not against the principle behind the right to buy. Among the benefits of the sale of social rented homes to tenants is the contribution that it can make in creating mixed tenure estates and mixed communities, particularly in urban areas. There is agreement across all parties that that is necessary in housing policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing associations have not generally sold their homes to tenants, up to now, because the proceeds of such sales would go to the Government, rather than being invested in replacement homes. That is why many of us welcome, in part, the Government's proposals. However, I have grave doubts about how the measure will operate and what will be its consequences for social housing. Figures from the National Federation of Housing Associations show that 78 per cent. of housing association tenants are on housing benefit and will not be in a position to buy their homes. In many areas, the shortage of affordable rented housing is such that a blanket policy of the right to buy for all housing association tenants risks devastating social housing stock locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been much discussion of that and I am glad that the Government have recognised that problem in their promises to give exemption for some properties in rural areas. However, I remain extremely disappointed that that provision is not in the Bill. For mat reason, I welcome amendments Nos. 83 and 87 in the name of the hon. Member for Leicester, East. The sooner we can make clear the immovable status of exemptions, the sooner we can reassure housing providers and give them confidence to build more properties in the areas where they are needed.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>79</span>
I welcome the fact that the Government have recognised the need to preserve rural areas. I have had discussions with many council leaders and colleagues up and down the country and many organisations, and it is extremely difficult to define rural communities. I do not dispute the fact that the condition of a population of 3,000 is a good start, but other areas need help to keep a reasonable stock of social housing.

In our discussions it became clear that, particularly in Kent and Sussex, there are areas where people are concerned about what might happen to the supply of social housing in areas that have a population of 5,000. The purpose of new clause 4 is to give local authorities a say in defining housing need in their area and to deal with some of the problems. I appreciate that Labour Members also wish to add flexibility to the proposals, but their amendments would give too much power to the Secretary of State, although my amendment would, in the end, give power to the Secretary of State. The sentiments behind amendment No. 88 are much the same as mine, but local people need to make those decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause and the linked amendments aim to empower local authorities to make decisions about what is best for people in their area, including housing association tenants who might want to buy their homes and those in the area who are in housing need. I am aware that lists of homeless people and the number of those who require housing are growing all the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be unreasonable to give local authorities carte blanche to exercise their discretion. However, I recognise the widespread acceptance of the fact that there will be exceptions and, not least, that housing associations accept that, and the criteria in new clause 4 would be helpful in making decisions about what should be included in the right-to-buy principle. They are intended to be exceptional, not the general rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The safeguard in the system would be that registered social landlords who held a majority of essential rented properties that were to be designated as protected, and objected to that, could apply to the Secretary of State, who would have the right to rule on the legitimacy of the local authority's decision. But the decision would have to be made with due regard to local circumstances. The landlords would have to give decent reasons for exempting the area. It is a commonsense amendment, which would create a balance between the right to buy and continuing to provide social housing, especially, but not exclusively in rural areas. The amendment would affect city areas. The 3,000 level, which is not contained
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
in the Bill, affects only rural areas, but there are city areas in which people would like the discretion to protect social housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I explain that because this group of amendments and the following group are interrelated, and it is thus difficult for members of the Committee to distinguish clearly between them, I shall be a little bit flexible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some members of the Committee want to press various amendments to a Division. So that no one is surprised, we shall take Divisions when we reach the relevant amendments on the Order Paper. I shall call formally the hon. Members who wish to move those amendments at that time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry Bellingham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-West Norfolk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to say a few words about amendments Nos. 83 and 84. I have always supported the right to buy, simply because it has brought untold joy to many households in my constituency. Out of a housing stock of approximately 12,000 houses in the borough, more than 4,500 houses have been bought. The effect on communities has been significant, bringing pride and independence to those households. One has only to visit villages in my constituency to witness the impact of houses that have been bought on the rest of the housing stock in a village or on a council estate. That should be compared with what happens to housing association properties. The housing association movement has been busy in west Norfolk in the past few years. It has built many developments, mainly sheltered housing, which is aimed at the elderly. Some properties are intended for younger people and there are some family-sized units. They have been built with public money. Whereas you can say to a council tenant, "You have the right to buy"—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The discussions I have with tenants in my surgery is not a matter for the Committee. When the hon. Gentleman uses the word "you", he refers to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will try to phrase my comments differently. There is a great desire among housing association tenants to have the same right to buy as council tenants. It is difficult not to support the Government's view that housing association tenants should have that right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hanson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would appreciate it if the hon. Gentleman could quantify the great desire for the right to buy among housing association tenants. No housing association tenant has come to my surgery to ask for the right to buy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could point out many housing association developments that include family-sized units in my constituency. Many of those families would like the right to buy. In most boroughs and districts in East Anglia, approximately a third of tenants have exercised the right to buy. Two thirds will remain council or public sector tenants. The figure for housing associations will be lower because many of their properties are aimed at elderly people. As I mentioned, most of them are sheltered dwellings, nevertheless some families are involved.

Undoubtedly, more housing for local people is needed in my constituency. Along the Norfolk coast, much housing has been bought as second homes by people from outside the area, or by people who have retired to west Norfolk. That has pushed up the price of housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time and again, rows of former farm cottages have been bought and turned into holiday cottages or second homes. That has had a profound effect on local people's ability to afford homes in their villages. The rural housing movement has an important part to play because of that process. Several important schemes have taken off in my constituency in recent years. Some of them have been due entirely to the generosity of local farm owners and landowners who have made land available, knowing of the existence of a firm commitment to making part of the development available to local people in perpetuity. I agree with the Country Landowners Association and the National Farmers Union, who have pointed out that such an element of certainty is necessary. If we want more landowners and fanners to make land available for such development, we should understand that they will want such an element of certainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have difficulty with the figure of 3,000, because in my constituency, for example, several parishes include outlying hamlets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We intend to designate not parishes but settlements. It is entirely possible that a parish that contained far more than 3,000 people could be designated in its entirety, because we would divide it into settlements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that, before we vote on amendments Nos. 83 or 84, the Minister should explain clearly and in detail the Government's view of the matter. Many people are concerned about the matter and slightly confused. If the Minister could satisfy me that the figure of 3,000 would not be arbitrary, and would not discriminate against communities and lead to anomalies, hon. Members representing rural constituencies, and anyone who is supporting the provision of the housing that we are discussing would probably be much more supportive and understanding about the adoption of that figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if designation is based on settlements, serious problems could arise. Settlements grow or decline. Around the main area of population in my constituency, Kings Lynn, are several very small villages, with populations well under 3,000—perhaps 200, 300 or 400 in some cases. They are within two or three miles of a town with a population of about 30,000. In those villages—certainly in two places—rural housing development has been undertaken. The tenants concerned would not take kindly to not having the right to buy. In some cases the land was not given by local landowners but was made available by the borough council for the housing association. Such anomalies can occur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not endorse the judgement in the Department of the Environment's White Paper, "Rural England" that
	<br><blockquote><p>"we have decided that all housing in communities of less than 3,000 should be excluded from the proposed Purchase Grant Scheme"?</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>82</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the Secretary of State was trying to achieve through the rural White Paper. I have simply pointed out that several anomalies will arise. That is why a great deal of flesh needs to be added to the bone of the relevant passages of the White Paper. Many hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will be looking forward to hearing the Minister's remarks. He is to make an important speech this morning and clear up some difficult points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am attracted to the idea of an exemption based on the planning application. I have in mind the granting of a planning application in the case of a landowner who has made land available, on condition that it should in part be occupied by local people. To specify such an exemption for rural communities would be a clear and powerful approach that everyone could understand. It would be possible to get away from other anomalies that could arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Minister is trying to do is absolutely right, and I support it. He is trying to give the right to buy to people who want it but have not had it up to now. He is also trying to ensure that the flow of rural housing from the landowning and farming communities continues. That flow has certainly gained pace in my constituency. I look forward to hearing what my hon. Friend has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Vaz</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. McWilliam, for showing some flexibility on this group of amendments. We intend to press amendments Nos. 83, 87, 88 and 91 to a Division, depending of course on what the Minister says. If he oozes the charm and reasonableness that he showed to my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford), we may not require a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall speak to amendments Nos. 83, 87 and 91 and my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson) will speak to amendment No. 88. Amendment No. 83 would exclude dwellings in rural settlements of fewer than 3,000 people from the effects of the clause. The tenant would not have the right to acquire the dwelling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me make it clear at the outset that Opposition Members support the general principle of the right to buy, but we believe that the Bill as drafted does not afford the protection that is required in special cases. Some of the concerns have just been expressed by the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have agreed to exclude rural settlements of fewer than 3,000 people from the purchase grant and voluntary purchase grant schemes, but they are oddly reticent about writing that into the Bill. Clause 16(1) allows the Secretary of State to designate rural areas where the right to buy will not arise, but that is a discretionary power and a future Secretary of State might not be so committed to the rural economy as the present one, who represents a Suffolk constituency, appears to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would firmly commit the Government to honouring their promise and, by stating that the rural settlement of fewer than 3,000 people was based on parish boundaries, it would provide a specific means of achieving the desired objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was heartened to receive this morning a detailed letter from the Country Landowners Association. I do not know whether that organisation has a branch in North-West Norfolk or whether the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk is its honorary president. I do not know whether
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0054">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>83</span>
the Minister goes to the association's annual dinner in Skipton, although I remember him speaking at the annual dinner of the Association of District Councils, at which he said that all the other candidates competing for his seat at his constituency selection conference had been members of the Country Landowners Association, but that he had been able to convince the conference that he was the best candidate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Country Landowners Association specifically mentioned amendment No. 83. It said that in the case of amendment No. 83, it doubted that the definition suggested of parish boundaries was the right one to choose. Settlements of fewer than 3,000 people could find themselves outside the rural exemption because of the existence of small outlying settlements within the parish boundary which then pushed the parish population over 3,000. It said that there might be other settlements of more than 3,000 people which nevertheless, because of their situation, were rural in character and where there was a shortage of less affordable housing. The threshold of 3,000 people needed further examination, as did the way in which the threshold was defined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There we have it. No less an organisation than the Country Landowners Association has urged the Minister to think again. I hope that he will think again in respect of amendment No. 83. If he does so, I shall not press the amendment to a vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 87 would exclude dwellings in particular areas such as national parks from the effects of the clause. There would be no right for the tenant to acquire the dwelling in those areas. Ministers have stated that the Government intend to exempt dwellings in rural communities of fewer than 3,000 people from the right to buy. We believe that it is also appropriate that dwellings in national parks, areas of outstanding natural beauty and the New forest should be exempt, as there is minimal scope in those areas to replace any sold properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Attercliffe pointed out, the Department of the Environment White Paper "Rural England" made a number of statements about the issue, one of which I regard as confusing. It says that in recognition of the
	<br><blockquote><p>"difficulties there can be in replacing properties in rural areas and the need to encourage the provision of affordable housing through planning exceptions, we have decided that all housing in communities of less than 3,000, including those in National Parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty, should be excluded from the proposed Purchase Grant Scheme."</p></blockquote>
That is on page 70. In our view, the reference to national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty is superfluous. Housing in communities of more than 3,000 in national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty will not be excluded from the right to acquire if the provisions remain unchanged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a list of these areas, which I do not propose to read out. However, I shall refer to the one in Suffolk, Coastal, for obvious reasons. The only settlement within that part of the Suffolk coast and the heaths area of outstanding natural beauty is Leiston, which has an estimated population of 5,700. Aldeburgh is just below the Minister's threshold, with a population of 2,700. I searched in vain to find somewhere in Skipton, but I was not successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>84</span>
I should like to refer to something that the hon. Member for north-west Leicestershire (Mr. Ashby)—who is no longer in the Room—said last week. I am sorry that I have not given the hon. Gentleman notice, but I expected that he would be back shortly. He was talking about housing associations, and it is important that in this debate on the right to buy, Opposition Members place on record their appreciation of the work of housing associations. The hon. Gentleman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Housing associations tend to be built up out of the Labour party, and are connected with a family or section of the party." [	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee G,</i> 8 February 1996; c.50.]</p></blockquote>
That is simply not the case. I have seen the Minister many times in the housing association press, opening this or that development. I am sure that he would be astonished to discover that he had been visiting a branch of the local Labour party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My colleagues and I have great enthusiasm for the work of housing associations. The history of the voluntary housing movement stretches back hundreds of years, but really took off in the last century, with the establishment of major charitable trusts such as Guinness, Peabody and William Sutton. Housing associations have enjoyed the support of all political parties. We all recognise that they do their work imaginatively and efficiently, and I hope that they will continue to do so. One of their strengths is their diversity: more than 2,200 housing associations of every shape and size are registered with the Housing Corporation. I think that every member of the Committee has a housing association in their constituency and will know of the good work that they do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also wish to pay tribute to the work of the Housing Corporation and its dedicated officers who have a difficult task dealing with regulation. I want to acknowledge the work of Anthony Mayer, the chief executive, and Sir Brian Pearse, the chairman, both appointees of the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to be beastly to the hon. Member for north-west Leicestershire, who has just returned to his seat. I have known him for nine years; he is a fellow Leicestershire Member of Parliament. Those of us representing a county constituency know how important it is to stay on good terms with our fellow county Members of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The housing association movement is a valuable part of our housing system. The associations are not branches of local political parties. They welcome the Government's approach, but have made it clear that a number of points need to be addressed before we can support this scheme. My hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson) will now speak to another amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hampstead and Highgate)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak to amendment No. 88, which would give the Secretary of State the power to designate areas other than rural areas so that they would be excluded from the right to buy that clause 16 will give to certain rural areas. As a Member of Parliament for an inner-London constituency, I feel strongly about that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
London is the capital city, but it would be wrong to represent it as a vast, homogeneous urban sprawl. In many respects, London is a series of villages. Over the past few years we have seen how housing associations, usually with funding from charitable sources, have managed to regenerate areas that had deteriorated gravely through force of circumstance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>85</span>
Housing associations have been responsible for the transformation of individual properties. For example, in virtually every street of my constituency, large late-Victorian and early-Edwardian properties, which were built for occupancy by single families, have been renovated. Over time, it became impossible for a single family to maintain such a property. Therefore, housing associations took over such properties and transformed them into secure and valuable dwellings that can be occupied by more than one family. In restoring individual properties, housing associations have contributed to the transformation of whole areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My area is a popular one in which to live, and housing associations have been able to build houses in different types of housing area. In doing that, they have managed to avoid the ghettoisation of social housing. People with varying economic resources live together in my constituency, and a real sense of community has been created. For example, small clusters of local shops have been retained. Such shops are of value to many of my constituents. My constituency is similar to many others in that it has an aging population. For elderly constituents, the presence of a small local shop is a great advantage. Many of those facilities would not have existed, but for the renovation work that housing associations have carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment should be accepted because the properties that I have described cannot be replaced in brown-field sites. In its response to the Government's consultation document, the National Federation of Housing Associations pointed out that a housing association provides one-bedroom flats in central London. If the tenants of those flats exercised their right to buy, it would cost the housing association £94,000 to build replacements whereas in the past it would have cost £70,000. Those flats are in a central London borough, and replacement properties may not be popular. Housing associations will have limited resources in future, but they should be able to provide decent, affordable rented housing in inner cities as well as in rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members hope that the Minister will look with favour on the amendment. Although the problem is replicated in all urban areas, it is not an exaggeration to say that London faces particularly grievous housing problems. The effects will be desperate if London boroughs lose social housing because of the right-to-buy facility. Labour Members are not opposed to the concept of right to buy, but the exemption that the Government will allow for rural areas should be extended to many urban areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Members who have spoken. I do not think that there is a gulf of principle on the issue. The only thing that terrified me was the glimpse that the hon. Member for Leicester, East gave of what might happen should the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) become Secretary of State for the Environment. An appalling picture was conjured up of the view that the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras takes of the countryside. However, I know the hon. Gentleman, and I am sure that he is deeply benign.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras loves the countryside. He was born in Yorkshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>86</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras may not have many redeeming features, but the fact that he was born in Yorkshire excuses many of his other sins.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing property that has not yet been built; we are not talking about existing properties. They are subject to a voluntary and opt-in scheme, which housing associations can choose to take up. As I said earlier, 120 of them have already said that they intend to opt into a scheme. I am concerned as the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate about the situation in London, which is why we have framed some broad exemptions on the opt-in scheme for existing properties. Housing associations that are active in London, such as the William Sutton trust, are satisfied that we have made considerable efforts to meet their concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with some of the hon. Lady's points: housing associations play an important part in the diversification of tenure. We are trying to avoid ghetto areas. In inner-city areas we want to see mixed tenure with people from mixed backgrounds to make the local community work. I do not wish to dislocate that activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his remarks, but I am not clear about his argument. Surely he acknowledges that strong pressures will be brought to bear on housing associations, not necessarily from their tenants—on whom pressure can, indeed, be brought to bear—but by those whose view of those properties might not be as benign as that of the Minister. Is not there some way of strengthening the powers of housing associations, so that they will not be put under such pressure from people who may not have at heart the best interests of tenants?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reflect on the hon. Lady's concerns to see whether there is a way in which to deal with the matter. However, I do not think that that is likely under the Bill. It is a matter of interpretation and attitude. Wearing my regeneration hat, I want to ensure that those inner-city areas work effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point concerns the proposed exemptions for rural areas, specifically as a result of the consultation exercise. They go further than the exemptions under the right-to-buy scheme. We have broken the link with right-to-buy and have proposed more extensive exemptions. We wish to acknowledge the particular situation of land that has been donated or made available at low prices in rural settlements. As members of the Committees have said, planning permission is often a more difficult problem because of the nature of rural areas than it is in the more urban environment. I can justify that from what happens in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have written to hon. Members explaining our methodology. I deliberately chose one of the most difficult areas—Berkshire. It is a south-east county and is close to urban' conglomerations. It is not an easy area to designate and I thought that it would be helpful to the Committee if I explained the designation process using a concrete example. I hope that members of the Committee found it to be a useful visual aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a Member of Parliament I represent the Dales national park, and, what is not national park, is an area of outstanding natural beauty. I have discussed the matter in detail with the local Country Landowners Association,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0056">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>87</span>
not to mention the Craven tenant farmers and the local National Farmers Union who have made their views known to me. I am conscious of the problems; I have experience of them in my surgeries. That is why I have been trying to devise a scheme that is simple, workable, effective and which rests on known concepts. The known concept under the Bill is the Rural Development Commission's notion of the rural settlement, which is to be found in the rural gazetteer—the Bible or encyclopedia of rural areas—and is why we have decided on settlements of 3,000. That concept is already understood as having a particular application. As I mentioned in the letter, we intend to spell that out in maps, where necessary, so that people will have a clear idea of what is included or excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would cause problems, which I shall explain. However virtuous the intention behind the amendments, many of them would not achieve their aim. They might even have some perverse effects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 16 would already allow the Secretary of State to designate, through secondary legislation, rural areas where the new right would not apply. We have announced our intention to exempt rural settlements from the new right, taking a population of 3,000 as a starting point. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales, the hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Jones), may want to explain later what will happen in Wales, for the full information of hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 83 would exempt in primary legislation all rural parishes with a population of fewer than 3,000 people. That would not work. If it were that easy to designate rural areas, we should have adopted that approach. I always look for simple solutions, but the amendment does not provide one. First, the tombstone effect—to introduce a new phrase into the Committee's deliberations—would come into play. When a parishioner died and the parish population fell below 3,000, tenants might lose the new right. With the first cry of a new baby the right might be reacquired, or gained. That would not be workable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment 83 would be a blunt instrument with which to operate on the basis of parish boundaries and populations—assuming that that is how it is intended to work. Where a parish had a settlement of more than 3,000 people and smaller ones of fewer than 3,000, the amendment would not protect the smaller settlements, as I pointed out to my hon. Friend the Member for North-West, Norfolk, nor would it protect a parish with, for example, two settlements with a population of 2,000, and a total parish population of 4,000. The parish boundary concept does not provide the necessary precision for the relevant application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tombstone problem would arise from new clause 4 and amendment No. 131, under which protected areas would be designated using a definition of
	<br><blockquote><p>"any community with a population lower than 3,000 lying within a parish boundary".</p></blockquote>
Our approach would ensure that all rural settlements would be protected and would stay protected, unless the secondary legislation was subsequently changed. Perhaps, after new censuses, it would be right to review matters. We intend to use census data to designate parishes by name. We intend them to remain designated until the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>88</span>
designation is changed, for example on the production of new information or census data. We do not want parishes to slip in and out of classification from year to year. Some stability is clearly needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Timms 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm whether the Government intend to designate every rural settlement with a population lower than 3,000, or will there be exceptions to the Government's intention in that respect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the Government intend to designate all settlements with populations of fewer than 3,000 people, using the methodology that I have described. We shall engage in consultation on the designations. I do not exclude the possibility that some settlements with populations marginally over the 3,000 level could have special reasons for wanting to be included. At some stage a line would have to be drawn. That is inherent in the business of designation. However, I do not intend to take the line of biblical certainty. There might be instances of parishes with populations somewhat over the 3,000 level where the circumstances would not justify me drawing a distinction.

I do not see the need to extend the power of designation, as would be provided for in amendment No. 88, so that other areas would be exempted. For reasons that I explained to the hon. Member for Christchurch, circumstances in the inner city equally merit our attention, but what we envisage does not lend itself to inner-city problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister explain what it is that makes rural areas amenable to treatment under the Bill but which does not apply to urban areas? What are the particular characteristics of rural areas that mean that other areas are not appropriate for such treatment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that there are two characteristics. First, obtaining planning permission is often more difficult in rural areas. For example, in a national park in an area of outstanding natural beauty, the rules on planning permission are more severe than elsewhere. In many urban areas, we are anxious to promote development. The nature of the development is part of the debate, and the hon. Gentleman and I agree on what that nature should be: a mixed development, with mixed tenure, where different sorts of people live, with recreation, jobs and educational opportunities which are as local as possible. I do not agree that there is a great divide on that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second characteristic that is found particularly in rural areas, and to a lesser extent in cities, is that the land that can be developed—for example, under rural exemptions—has been donated by landowners on the express condition that it should be available for renting. We want to respect that condition so that we maintain the flow of that land into settlements in rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why we think that we have come up with a sensible scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Burden 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Northfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the Minister's reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Timms).

Following his logic, I assume that he would not want to introduce a catch-all designation, as he has with rural areas. But the amendments allow for permissive designations, so that where the circumstances are similar, city areas could also be designated. Why does the Minister object to that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because I do not think that we can apply to problems that affect cities a mechanism that is clearly designed to apply to the countryside, where there are scattered, more isolated settlements and different problems. I am willing to discuss with the hon. Gentleman the problems that relate to the cities and housing in cities, but I do not think that we should transpose to the cities that mechanism for rural areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put to the Minister the particular case of an urban area where land is given specifically for social housing? Does not the logic of his argument imply that an exemption ought to be available in that case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because if the land is given, the housing association sells that land to the tenant at a discounted maket value, but, for the housing association that is the market value because it gets a grant from the Housing Corporation to make up the difference between that value and what the tenant pays. All those proceeds can be redirected to creating new lettings in that area. The difference between that and circumstances in rural areas is that the housing association benefits from the value of that donation to recycle into new housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have summed up the Government's proposal, which I have sought to make simple so that it will work. We have worked hard to try to deliver a proposal that will be effective. We have consulted widely and I believe that the scheme will be effective. I commend it to the Committee and advise against accepting the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Gwilym Jones)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that it will assist the Committee if I explain, as my hon. Friend the Minister indicated, that we are contemplating a slightly different approach in Wales. As one would expect, we examined my hon. Friend's proposal but, in Wales, we have a slightly different pattern, with a number of large but sparsely populated areas. We felt that to exempt rural settlements with a population of 3,000 or below would not be appropriate for Wales. Neither the Welsh Office nor Housing for Wales have used that definition of "rural".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are, therefore, considering an approach based on population density. We have chosen as a starting point community council areas with a population density of fewer than 150 persons per sq km. That is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development definition of rurality, which has been used by the Rural Development Commission in the rural indicators project. Therefore, it is widely recognised. We intend to consult local authorities, housing associations and other interested parties about our proposal shortly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister know how many community councils in Wales will be covered by the definition that he gave the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>90</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have the figure for community councils at my fingertips. Our work so far, however, suggests that more than 80 per cent. of the total area, and one fifth of the population of Wales would be covered by the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I began this morning by feeling optimistic that we would have a rational, reasonable debate. The Minster agreed with my first contribution and I believed that we would sail through, with a general understanding of the rightness of our amendments, and that we would finish our proceedings in a couple of weeks, with a better Bill. Sadly, after an hour, I am disillusioned by the Minister's response to the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is a young man.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Sedentary interventions are to be deplored, especially from one's hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The comments of my hon. Friend that I am a young man is welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unconvinced by the Minister's response to the amendments, especially on two matters. I did not understand the Minister's opposition to granting Ministers additional powers to designate areas other than rural areas under clause 16. Ministers are not usually worried about receiving extra powers by regulation. Arguments in Committee often stem from Ministers claiming more powers by regulation and the Opposition questioning their necessity. Therefore, we are in an unusual position: the Opposition would like to grant even the current Secretary of State additional powers. One of the Minister's objections was that there might be a different Secretary of State in a few months—he understands the feeling in the country as well as we do. We tried, however, to make a genuine point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister claimed that circumstances in rural areas were different from those in urban areas because rural landowners might have given land on a charitable basis to provide housing. His response when challenged by my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East, who asked whether a similar situation could exist in an urban area, did not convince me. There was no logic in the Minister's argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Potential similarities exist between urban and rural areas. I accept that there are differences between the problems of urban and rural areas. Some urban places contain conservation areas, where it is difficult to find a suitable means of replacing a property that is sold. The rationale and raison d'être of a mechanism for exempting small rural communities is the difficulty of replacing any rented property that is sold off with another rented property. That is the reason for restrictions: to ensure that properties to rent continue to exist in those areas. Similar problems that required similar treatment could exist in some urban areas. The amendment would make it possible for the Minister to regulate if those particular circumstances were found to be ones that needed to be dealt with—no more than that. Why is the Minister so adamant in his opposition to the amendment? All we are saying is that if, in the Minister's judgment, those circumstances have occurred, he can make a designation. There is no great point of principle on which the Minister should reject the amendment.

Before the Minister asks what national parks have to do with Sheffield, I can tell him that they have nothing to do with my constituency, but a third of the Sheffield city council area is in the Peak district national park. There is a big interest in the city and in the constituencies of my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mrs. Jackson) and the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Sir I. Patnick).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are particular problems and, despite what the Minister has said about his intention to deal with rural settlements of fewer than 3,000 people, I am not convinced that all of them will be solved. We support the principle, but have a different way of dealing with the matter. There would still be a potential problem, even if the settlement figure was beyond the 3,000 people mark, for example 3,500 people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister suggested that he intends to deal with rural settlements of fewer than 3,000 people by means of regulations, but that could leave parts of national parks with problems because of planning constraints—properties could be sold with no possibility of them being replaced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many national parks, particularly those near Sheffield, there has been the growing trend of properties being bought by people who do not live there permanently, but who use them as weekend homes and in their leisure time. We must try to preserve homes for local people who live and work in such communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not address the fact that in part V of the Housing Act 1985 there is a provision to exempt properties in national parks from the right to buy. The Committee is considering removing the restriction by regulation, but he did not put any convincing arguments for that. I contend that the restriction is necessary. If it was necessary for the 1985 Act, it should be necessary for the Bill. I hope that the Minister will explain why the restriction might be removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to go back to the statement made by the Under-Secretary of State for Wales. Having heard the Minister's views for the first time, I want him to clarify now, or later in writing, whether there are properties in Wales which would now be excluded because of the change from an English to a Welsh definition. What would the English definition have included? The definition that he has given suggests that there is a change from that of England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are there properties which will not meet the definition for Wales outlined by the Minister but which would have been included because of the rural nature of some areas? There are properties in my constituency which, under the English definition, would have come under the exclusion. Does the Welsh definition extend the area or are there areas under the English definition which would now be excluded? I hope that that is clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can help the hon. Gentleman. The examination of both methods—our density figure of 150 per sq km or the figure of 3,000 people as proposed by my hon. Friend the Minister—produced similar results. My hon. Friend's proposal would deal with about 80 per cent. of the part of Wales to be included. Our proposal would go a little further; to about 84 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>92</span>
We have been concerned about the difference in patterns. We use community councils as community areas, because we do not have parish councils in Wales. Community councils seem to be the appropriate area. We have been concerned about the anomalies of large but sparsely populated areas that would not be treated properly. However, I believe that we have proposed a more appropriate arrangement for Wales. It does not produce a strikingly different result, but it covers slightly more of Wales. I very much hope that our consultations on the proposal will satisfy any remaining doubts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that clarification. I wanted to be clear that there would not be areas of Wales that would have been included under the English definition, but would now be excluded. His point about percentages has satisfied me. Some rural areas in my constituency are large community council geographical areas. The size of their population might bring them under the English definition, but they may well fall outside the Welsh definition because of the nature and size of their community councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the Minister's word on the matter and will certainly follow it up in due course to see what the outcome is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Brooke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of London and Westminster, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me start with an apology to you, Mr. McWilliam. I am recorded in a previous sitting as having addressed you in the plural rather than the singular. As I am subject to the same condition of sometimes being put in the plural, I can say with absolute certainty that I put you in the singular. However, I do not think that it would be worth either of us going back to correct the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee of Selection, in its wisdom, selected me as the only Conservative Member of the Committee, who represents a London constituency. Given the size of London, that puts a substantial burden on my shoulders. Necessarily, I rise to speak to the same amendment addressed by the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate, rather than speaking to the amendments on rural areas. However, as St. Martin-in-the-Fields stands within half a mile of this place, there was clearly a time when this was a rural constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituency has been losing votes on the electoral register at the rate of 1,000 a year since 1950. That is partly a reflection of the acquisition of accommodation in central London by foreigners or companies, which means that fewer people appear on the electoral register. The Department of Environment expects that much of the extra demand for housing in this country in the next 25 or 30 years is likely to come from foreigners. In a central London constituency—the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate is in the same position in this respect—we are likely to see more foreigners moving in who do not have votes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no complaint about the rules that the boundary commission has set: it says that the amount of work that a Member of Parliament has to do shall not in any way affect the boundaries. But nor am I am man to wear wounds on my sleeves. The average constituency has a working population of fewer than 40,000. The working population of the constituency that comes closest to mine
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0059">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>93</span>
in that respect is 150,000, whereas my constituency has a working population of 750,000. That is partly because it is at the heart of a great city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said on Second Reading, there is a need for low-income housing—which some may call social housing—near the centre of a city to provide the local services. Without quoting particular cases, I know that I receive considerably more complaints about the quality of public services in certain parts of my constituency than in others. That is partly due to the fact that there is no low-income housing in one area, and a substantial amount of low-income housing in the other. Consequently, the quality of the service and labour in certain parts of the constituency is less good because people have to travel much further to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consequence of this huge daytime population—I am grateful to you for not ruling me out of order for introducing the subject, Mr. McWilliam—is that those who live in the constituency are much more widely spaced than would be the case in most other urban seats, if not rural ones. That causes management difficulties for housing associations when it comes to controlling dispersed properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clearly eminently desirable to maintain the life of the inner city. I am delighted that the housing association movement has expanded. I agree with the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate that London is a series of villages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background, I am happy to support my hon. Friend the Minister in rejecting the amendment in an urban context. I say that as someone who has lived in a block of flats in London for many years. There are problems of management in those blocks of flats that are owned partly by leaseholders and partly by tenants. Even the leaseholders and tenants face problems and the problems for those with managerial responsibilities, such as housing associations, will become even greater if ownership becomes more mixed as a result of the Bill. I ask the Minister seriously to contemplate giving housing association management more flexibility and fluidity when it comes to disclosing the properties of which they intend to dispose under the right-to-buy provisions. That will ease their management problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My argument now becomes circular. On Second Reading, I expressed my view that the extra costs that would be imposed on housing associations as a result of implementing the right to buy should not be added to the rents of their tenants. If the costs end up on rents, we shall destroy the point of providing housing association homes. Such homes serve the needs of people in this great city and, in particular, the inner city that I represent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for his remarks. I take to heart his concerns, but he will be aware that our proposals for existing properties have sought to provide the flexibility that he wants. I believe that we have satisfied the concerns of those housing associations that are prominent in London. I shall reflect on whether we need further flexibility, but our intention has been to provide that. It is an opt-in scheme, not an obligatory scheme for existing properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for rural areas, we are following the model in the right to buy. The existing right-to-buy scheme designates rural areas, but for resale restrictions only. In all other areas, the right to buy is freely available. Therefore,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>94</span>
the 3,000 settlement concept is far more restrictive than that which already exists under the right to buy and which is widely accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have considered the geography. Only 17 settlements in English national parks are not caught by the 3,000 settlement limit. Some of those may be sufficiently close to the limit to allow a margin of flexibility. We have made great efforts to create a simple mechanism that works. I commend that mechanism, rather than the alternatives, to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Despite what the Minister says, we intend to press the amendment to a Division. The longer the debate goes on, the more difficult it is for us to understand the Minister's reasoning. I am sorry that it was left to my hon. Friends the Members for Newham, North-East and for Sheffield, Attercliffe to come to the aid of the countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal outlined by the Under-Secretary of State for Wales is almost as easy to understand as the compilation of the domesday book. If a crying baby affects the size of a parish, someone visiting Aunt Madge on a particular day will bring down the total from 150 to 149 people a square metre. It is difficult to understand how that will work. My hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) is right. Why should the proposals for Wales be different from those for England? That is not acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that include Parliaments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I knew that the Minister was going to ask that. I gave him that opportunity. As he knows, the Labour party is proposing not a Parliament for Wales, but an assembly. I shall send him the documents, so that he can read them carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may reject the arguments of my hon. Friends the Members for Newham, North-East and for Sheffield, Atterclife, the former leaders of Newham and Sheffield councils. However, if he did that, he would also reject the wise words of the Country Landowners Association. I would not like to be in the Minister's Range Rover the next time he goes to Skipton. His comments have not put people's minds at rest. We shall press the amendments to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the serious and constructive way in which the Minister has dealt with our anxieties. Considerable fears have been expressed not only by the Country Landowners Association, but by many councils throughout the country. I know that there are concerns in the New Forest, which is not a national park but is an area of outstanding natural beauty. The council is concerned because there are settlements of more than 3,000 people there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken to people from Hereford, North Devon, South Norfolk, Horsham and Tonbridge and Mailing. Many of the problems will not be solved unless we write something reasonable into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk made a compelling argument why the Committee should support the amendments. He said that local knowledge was important. Indeed, the Minister also recognised that to some extent in his response. I am therefore disappointed that we are unlikely to get further and improve the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>95</span>
People are concerned about the difficulty in replacing properties where they are needed and within a decent time scale. They are also concerned about the possible loss of money to housing associations, which will be allowed to use receipts, but will lose money in the process. Some housing associations believe that they will get only about 50 per cent. of the proceeds. There is concern about the lack of good will among people who have previously given land at low cost or no cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend to the Minister the comments of Dorset community council, which is extremely concerned that housing associations will have insufficient money to buy back properties and that landowners will be unwilling to make gifts of land. It is worried that some areas may lose confidence as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our discussions have been wide ranging and it is clear that the problems are not only in rural areas. As the hon. Member for Leicester, East said, it is extraordinary that we have heard urban Members of Parliament supporting the rural areas. The amendments would help to obviate problems in both rural and urban areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much agreement about the problems and I welcome the fact that the Minister intends to consult widely on how to deal with them. We all support him in that. However, that is where our support ends. I and my Liberal Democrat colleagues want the issue to be addressed locally. That is the purpose of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was somewhat surprised to hear the hon. Member for Attercliffe saying that he wanted to give power to Ministers—indeed, I think that he surprised even himself. We have a different approach. I intend to press the amendment to a vote. For all the reasons that I have outlined, I invite the Committe to support the amendment and, if it is successful, to support new clause 4 at the appropriate time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are an attempt to improve the Bill. The Bill defines the properties that tenants will have the right to buy as those that have received grant under clauses 17 and 27. The Minister has clearly described the cut-off: only new dwellings provided by grant under the Bill will be subject to tenants' right to buy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned that the Bill as drafted could have a disadvantageous effect on some associations and properties—we hope that the Government did not intend that. The clause refers to property:
	<br><blockquote><p>"provided or acquired wholly or in part by means of a grant under section 17"</p></blockquote>
or, in the following paragraph, "section 27". We are concerned about the words "wholly or in part". Clearly, if a dwelling is wholly provided—100 per cent. funded—by a grant under clause 17 or clause 27, the right of the tenant to buy the property will apply, and we can all agree that the intention of the Bill is fully met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem arises with the words "or in part". What does that mean? It could refer to a property that was almost wholly provided by grant, say, 99.5 per cent. provided by grant and 0.5 per cent. by other funds. In that case, there would again be no problem, but at the other extreme, it could refer to a property that cost £50,000 and received a grant of £10—the rest of the money being provided by an association from other funds. In that example, we question whether the overall intent of the Bill would be properly reflected in the application of the words of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we understand it, the Government are saying that where properties are provided by public funds, tenants should have the right to buy them, just as tenants of local authority houses do. Tenants in properties provided by a social landlord and by grants as described in the Bill should have the right to buy because the properties were provided by public funds. On the other hand, the Government are clearly not advocating the right to buy for tenants of privately-owned rented property. The use of public funds provides the distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some circumstances, properties for rent are provided almost wholly by public funds. However, some housing associations have in the past received substantial donations, some of which were in the form of trusts, for the purpose of providing homes for rent, often for restricted categories of people such as the elderly or those who have lived in an area for a long time. One such is the William Sutton trust, mentioned by the Minister, which has houses in the constituency of my hon. Friend

and Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough. Properties have been purchased with money donated to the trust; properties could be provided in future in a similar way.

A trust's revenues from rental income also can be used for future development. For instance, a housing association might consider applying for a grant under the Bill; the grant might be for only 5 per cent. or 10 per cent. of the total development costs, the other money coming from the associations's own resources—money donated for specific purposes or acquired from rental revenues from properties built for specific purposes. We have great reservations about whether the right to buy should apply in such circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to draw my hon. Friend's attention to a trust which is in that position. The Horton trust houses women who have suffered domestic violence. The trust will be looking to its future development, and the Bill will cause it severe difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, my hon. Friend is absolutely right. Bodies and associations with a remit to provide properties for a particular category of people will be caught. Of course, it will be difficult to argue that the right to buy should apply as much to a property if only a little public money was involved as to a property that was provided wholly from public funds. The Minister might say that the example of a £10 grant was absurd and could not apply. That may be so, but there must be examples in which a limited proportion of the total cost of development comes from public funds. The problem is that under the Bill only £1 of public money has to be paid for the cost of a development to be partly provided from public funds and, therefore, subject to the right to buy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The three amendments—they hang together—seek that there should be a clear cut-off and that if 25 per cent. of funding comes from an association's own resources, its properties should be exempted. We want that provision to be clearly stated in the Bill. It is a reasonable proposition that everyone—the associations and the tenants—should know the rules. It would not then be necessary to ask a court to decide whether the legislation meant one thing or another, or for a Minister to have to give a ruling about whether the legislation meant this or that. If public money accounted for 25 per cent. or more of the cost of a dwelling, it would be regarded as having been provided by pubic money, and the right to buy would exist. If public money formed less than 25 per cent., the right to buy would not exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister might say that clause 15(4) gives the corporation the right to exclude dwellings on which a small amount of public funds had been spent. We are not sure what subsection (4) means. It could mean that properties would be excluded if the grant was given simply for renovation rather than for building. Presumably, the Minister can clarify whether that is what it means. If it means that, it does not mean that a property that was built with a small element of public funding could be excluded. Any property with any element of public funding would be subject to the right to buy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is simple but important. There should be an appropriate definition of a small element of public funds. We chose a figure of 25 per cent. and the Minister suggested that 20 per cent. would be more appropriate.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>98</span>
We are willing to listen to his arguments. We must ensure that associations are not discouraged from developing when they need a small element of funding from the social grant to top up their own funds. They may be concerned that their own funds will be put at risk by the right to buy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a great deal of sympathy with the hon. Gentlemen's point and I look forward to the Minister's response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to speak mainly to amendment No. 122, which is similar in spirit to the other amendments in this group. It is designed to make it clear that the right to buy will not exist merely because public money has been spent on repairs and alterations. The money would have to have been for building a dwelling or for creating a separate dwelling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the Minister to spell out on the record the purpose of subsection (4). I would be satisfied if the Government made a clear and sensible distinction between provision of dwellings or creation of new lettings and provision of repairs or improvements to existing dwellings. There is no doubt that registered social landlords have to balance the creation of mixed communities with the management of other problems, and that considerable difficulties are sometimes encountered. There should be discussions and they should not be forced to sell in all cases. Where does the Minister stand on subsection (4)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be able to help hon. Members. I do not accept the amendments, but I hope that I can explain why not and that they will not cause the Committee too much of a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing associations receive Government grant towards part of the cost of providing new dwellings. They have to borrow the remainder or use reserves or some other source of income. That is a classic mechanism with which everyone is familiar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 80 and 81 would restrict the right to buy to tenants of stock that had been provided with at least 25 per cent. of public money. The amount of housing association grant paid on a scheme varies by region. At current rates it varies between about 40 per cent. and 70 per cent. In rural areas it might be lower and in urban areas, where land is more expensive, it could go as high as 70 per cent. Some schemes may receive less HAG, for example, if cheap land is being provided. We discussed that on an earlier amendment. The amendments would reduce the number of tenants eligible to purchase their homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see the need for the amendments. Registered social landlords will retain the receipt from sales to tenants under the scheme and will be required to use it to provide replacement property for social renting, regardless of the original amount of grant. The benefit of any contribution from reserves or donations in homes that are sold will, therefore, be transferred to the replacement properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 15(2) means that homes provided wholly or partially with money from the disposal proceeds fund will be subject to the new right to buy. The words "wholly or in part" in clause 15(2)(a) make it clear that replacement homes do not have to be built solely with money from the disposal proceeds fund, without any supplement from private finance or reserves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sutcliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that we are trying to make is about special provision and special needs. The provisions for small trusts or associations, in which receipts will be used for other premises, will not work. Those trusts and associations form a special group, so will the Minister tell us how he intends to deal with areas of special need and provision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall discuss special needs housing shortly. When we come to it, I hope that I shall be able to help the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the ring-fenced fund is to provide replacement properties for social renting. It is reasonable to require social landlords to supplement the money in the fund with loans or from their reserves, as they are required to do with the social housing grant. Amendment No. 82 would mean that the homes that would attract right to buy would be only those built solely with money from the disposals proceeds fund. That would reduce the number of tenants entitled to purchase their homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister talks about replacements. Does he accept that an association may build a property for £50,000, but that its value may be only £40,000? Therefore, there is a gap that means that a similar replacement home cannot be provided. If the property is built mainly from the associations's own funds, the association may lose out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that that may occur in some transactions, but the opposite may be true of other cases. Our calculations were considered carefully and they suggest that the figures will net out. I prefer to remain with the most simple formulation that can be found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 122, questions were asked about the meaning of clause 15(4). I shall be clear about that. When the Housing Corporation gives grant, it will tell the housing association if accepting the grant will bring properties under the provisions of the scheme. That is because it is difficult in law to distinguish between major repairs to an existing property and a full rehabilitation leading to a new letting. Grant for the latter will give rise to the new right: grant for the former will not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 122 would also suggest that social landlords could use money from the disposal proceeds fund on general maintenance and repair. That is not the purpose of the fund. Our intention is that money in the disposal proceeds fund should be used only to provide replacement properties for social renting. I think that I have replied to the points raised by hon. Members. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not satisfied with the Minister's response. The Opposition have raised important concerns and the provisions may effect some associations badly in certain circumstances. If the Minister had come up with a different way of tackling the problem, we would have been prepared to listen to him. However, we are not satisfied with his reply. We shall pursue our amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment is technical and is designed to explain the phrase,
	<br><blockquote><p>"having remained with the social rented sector".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would tighten up the definition. Subsection (3) tries to explain the phrase. It does that by providing that anyone with an interest in the property must have been an individual tenant or a social landlord. The only exception is where the interest is a security interest. That covers a lender's interest in the property, but there are other cases where, for example, a person might have an interest through an easement, such as a right of way, and we would not want that sort of interest to prevent die tenant from being able to exercise the right to buy. The amendment clears up that wording and I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>'A registered social landlord from whom the tenant is acquiring a dwelling under these provisions shall have the duty to provide the tenant with information about the implications and costs of purchase.'.</p></blockquote>
This amendment would place a duty on housing associations that are selling properties to tenants to advise them of the costs and implications of becoming home owners. That matter has already been mentioned in Committee this morning. The proposal would ensure that people entering into home ownership for the first time are fully aware of the implications of becoming home owners, including the long-term costs and responsibilities. I am moving the amendment because I know, as do other hon. Members, that all sorts of problems have arisen or people who entered, excitedly and in good faith, into home ownership and have had problems over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Age Concern is particularly concerned about elderly people who have found themselves in great difficulty. It highlighted to me the case of a pensioner couple who bought their council flat in the 1980s. They have now been told that they will have to contribute £6,500 to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>102</span>
cost of external painting for the whole block. When they purchased their flat, they were not aware that there would be costs in addition to the annual service charge of £375, which they knew about. They were told that a certain amount of that charge was for repairs. Such people rely on state pensions and are unable to afford large sums of money, such as £6,500. They have been told that there is a possibility of eviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am moving my amendment to avoid such situations. To allow business to move on quickly, I shall not outline other cases. All members of the Committee have come across cases in which people have got into difficulty. It is only right that we give every assistance to people who enter into home ownership and give them the best advice so that they can decide whether such a step is right for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As on other matters, the hon. Member for Christchurch has a point. Labour Members know from experience that there have been difficulties with the right-to-buy policy when tenants have not been given full information at the beginning. Our concern is whether the issue should be dealt with in this way, or whether we should ask the Government to come up with general proposals for the right-to-buy policy to ensure that tenants have full and proper information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember that when the right-to-buy policy was introduced in the early 1980s, Conservative councillors in Sheffield and Ministers berated the local authority for ensuring that all tenants, before they bought properties, were fully briefed about all the issues involved. That was termed a discouragement to people from buying property. Most people who were intent on buying were not discouraged, but some people were given information that it was right for them to have and to take into account. If that information meant that tenants decided to think again because of potential costs, it was right that they had that information at the beginning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to draw particular attention to the difficulties of people in blocks of flats where there is an obligation on the purchaser to share in the maintenance of the communal areas of those flats in the future. As we know, that has led to incredible problems for council tenants who have bought properties under the right-to-buy scheme, and who did not think of the potential cost that they might incur and the responsibilities that they would have. It is arguable that in some cases, the enormous repair costs of the external and internal communal features of the properties have resulted in negative value. People certainly cannot sell those properties on the open market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such information should be available to prospective purchasers at the outset. The Government seem rather to have changed their mind, in view of the number of complaints that have been made. Some sad stories have been told of people who have no hope of moving out of such properties, which they cannot sell. The Government's, attitude has changed to sympathy for people and, perhaps, to a search for ways out of their problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be much better if the Government responded by laying down for the future a legal requirement for all landlords to provide information in the way I have outlined, whether they are housing associations, local

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>103</span>
authorities or anything else. It is right and proper to ensure that that information is provided. I hope that the Minister will come up with a different way of proceeding, in response to a problem that for some people is very real. Let us deal with the problem before it occurs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I invite the hon. Member for Christchurch to withdraw the amendment. No other legislation concerning the right to buy includes a requirement such as the amendment would impose, but that has not stopped a wide range of information being made available—booklets such as the ones I have here, and materials from the Housing Corporation and housing associations. We have to leave the matter to the good sense of the Housing Corporation and individual associations. We do not need legislation. Those bodies will, I am sure, see that the information that they provide for tenants in the purchase grant scheme is clear and balanced and includes advice on the responsibilities as well as the benefits of home ownership. We should not single out the purchase grant scheme as requiring the establishment of the duty that the amendment would impose. That would not ensure that tenants had all the relevant advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tenants in flats will be given estimates of service charges for the first five years in respect of repairs. Landlords cannot charge more than that. That provision is in the right-to-buy legislation and will apply in the cases that we are debating. I ask the hon. Lady to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are intended to elicit from the Minister a statement about where the Government stand with regard to disabled people.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Housing Act 1988 gave rise to considerable discussions on the subject, and two schools of thought have always existed on the matter. People are genuinely concerned that adapted property should be kept for disabled people in the social housing sector. That was
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>104</span>
probably the view that prevailed in 1988. Discussions about the rights of disabled people, and whether they should be treated in exactly the same way as able-bodied people have moved on. Much discussion took place because of the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill. The amendments are intended to establish the Government's stance on the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everybody concerned recognises that it would not be desirable to lose properties that have been adapted for disabled people. However, I have sympathy with those who are disabled and who want to be treated like everyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be briefer than I had intended, because hon. Members are anxious to move on this morning. We have outlined already this morning some of the arguments about keeping special needs properties. I will not labour any of the points further.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I will cover that point in my remarks on amendment No. 132, which seeks to exclude special needs housing for which the landlord receives additional revenue grant from the Housing Corporation. Special needs exemptions are included in the right to buy. They cover housing for people with disabilities, housing for the elderly and specially designed housing. Other types of special needs accommodation is effectively excluded because it is not self-contained. However, I accept that since the right-to-buy exclusions were implemented there have been changes in the way in which some special needs accommodation has been provided, so it is reasonable to add such accommodation. We need to find a careful definition that is not too broad. If the hon.

I shall speak to amendment No. 84. My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe) will speak to amendment No. 85. My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East will speak to amendment No. 86. My hon. Friend the Member for Delyn will speak to amendment No. 90. My hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) will speak to amendment No. 92.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 84 would exclude dwellings on which there were covenants or agreements, including section 106 agreements, which restricted their future use to use as affordable or social housing from the effects of the clause. The tenant would not have the right to acquire the dwellings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers have stated that it is intended to exempt from the right to acquire properties in rural communities settlements of a population of 3,000 or fewer. However, such a narrow exemption will seriously undermine the continued use of the planning system to encourage the provision of much-needed affordable housing in other areas where land values are high and land supply is limited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have recently launched a review of planning policy entitled "Planning for Prosperity". During the planning review I am sure that there will be a great deal of support for the use of the planning system to provide affordable housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent years and with the specific encouragement of the Government through planning policy guidance notes—PPG 3 in particular—planning policies have been used to help to create affordable housing. Opposition Members support that. In rural areas, planning permission has been given exceptionally for housing developments on land which would not otherwise be built on, thus enabling sites to be acquired at full market value and to encourage landowners to donate land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An essential part of the policy has been the use of section 106 planning agreements to ensure that housing produced by that mechanism is restricted to local people who cannot afford to buy a dwelling, and that it remains so in perpetuity. Sometimes, covenants are used instead of section 106 agreements. In rural and other areas, authorities have also been encouraged to regard the community need for affordable housing as a material planning consideration in formulating development plans.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0066">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>107</span>
That has resulted in the negotiation of quotas requiring developers on specific sites to provide an agreed number of units for social housing or the earmarking of sites for social housing development only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the encouragement of the Government, authorities have often ensured the availability of properties to successor as well as initial occupiers by involving housing associations in the schemes. Paragraph 43 of PPG 3 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Most commonly, the best way of ensuring that affordable housing will be enjoyed by successive as well as initial occupiers of property is by the involvement of a housing association or other social body (e.g. a trust) providing housing for rent or shared ownership: the body's continuing interest in the property will ensure control over subsequent changes of ownership and occupation."</p></blockquote>
Authorities have followed that advice and many of the schemes are underpinned by section 106 agreements. In rural areas, the success of the planning policies depend on landowners either donating land free or at considerably less than market value for community benefit, on the understanding that the properties will never be sold on the open market. Moreover, planning permission would not have been given in the first place if that were not the case. That applies also to non-rural areas where other special planning mechanisms have been used to create social housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several examples of district councils which have exception sites in rural areas and settlements with a population of greater than 3,000, or which are expected to exceed 3,000 in population over the next three years. Huntingdonshire, for obvious reasons, will be of interest to the Minister. It has no rural exception sites in place or any that are about to be released in settlements with a population greater than 3,000. A development has, however, been permitted for 24 dwellings under exceptions policy H8 of the Huntingdonshire local plan on the periphery of Huntingdon. The Association of District Councils has advised me that it is a market town with a population of 17,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department of the Environment's consultation paper on purchase grants that was published in June stated that it was the intention merely to give housing associations the discretion to require the purchasing tenant in a dwelling that was subject to a section 106 agreement in a rural area to resell the property to them. That gives no guarantee to landowners or planning authorities that the houses will remain affordable in perpetuity. Even if that restriction were imposed, there would be no guarantee that the housing association would have the resources available at the relevant time to re-purchase the property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Leicester, East would achieve a similar result to amendment No. 123. It would exclude dwellings which were subject to covenants or agreements that restricted their future use to affordable social housing. Tenants would have no right to buy such dwellings. The arguments are clear. Housing associations and tenants often benefit from the generosity of not only organisations but individuals who wish to help meet local housing needs. Homes with affordable rents might be built on land that the landowners might have refused to sell for any other purpose. Housing associations might also benefit from obtaining the land at below market value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>108</span>
To ensure that homes are used subsequently for the purpose for which they were intended, they should not be included in the scheme. Dwellings that are subject to restrictive covenants and agreements should be excluded from the provision. The Government should not make the proposed right to buy override those covenants or agreements because to do so would break trust and, as the community council in Dorset said, it could result in a reduction in good will between housing associations and others in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Four categories of dwellings should be excluded. The first is dwellings on land provided by local authorities which is restricted by covenant to use for the development of social housing. Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 obligates such an agreement. The second group is affordable housing that is negotiated following the terms of the planning policy guidance, under which developers involve housing associations as a way of securing the provision of affordable housing or a private sector housing site. In addition, the guidance states that controls should be in place to guarantee that such housing is available to successive occupiers, not only to the first occupier. Section 106 obligations are used to ensure social housing provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third category is where a planning mechanism—usually a section 106 agreement—has been used to secure dwellings for certain groups, such as the elderly, according to local needs identified by local councils. The fourth category is dwellings on land or in properties gifted to an association or charitable trust. The amendment does not seek exemptions for property that has become subject to a nomination agreement with a local authority but that is not, in other contexts, subject to reduced land price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that section 106 agreements cannot dictate tenure, but they are intended to maintain sites for low-cost housing; hence the reference in amendment No. 123 to "affordable housing". An existing tenant with the benefit of discount under the purchase grant scheme might find such a property affordable, but his or her successor would have to pay the full market value and the dwelling would therefore be lost as affordable housing. Amendment No. 123 seeks to avoid that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sutcliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the brief time that remains, I shall speak to amendment No. 85. It is part of the continuing theme of looking for exemptions in the best interests of tenants—the potential purchasers—and the associations. The amendment allows associations to undertake major refurbishment of properties purchased by them, even if those properties have existing tenants. We have already heard horror stories of redevelopments taking place, with tenants remaining in situ who had the right to buy. The amendment deals with buildings and flats, and my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe has already spoken about such problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should reflect on some of the problems caused by major developments that have taken place where the right to buy has existed. He is aware of the city challenge problems in the Holmewood area in my constituency and the Royds development, where major refurbishments have taken place. We are debating the right to buy in the context of social housing. The scheme should give housing associations the opportunity to replace homes; provision for social housing should not be cut. Tenants should be protected when purchasing

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>109</span>
properties in need of repair. The amendment would safeguard them for up to three years and I hope that the Government see the sense of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to refer briefly to amendment No. 92. The Bill, like so much other legislation, gives the Secretary of State immense powers. It allows him to change the legislation or to introduce new powers by order. Except for those supplementary provisions that apply in clause 15, we suggest that if the Secretary of State wishes to amend the legislation, the House of Commons should be able to comment on his proposals. The right to buy and the exemptions are well tried; past practice has given the Secretary of State plenty of experience to draw on. However, the House should have the opportunity to debate any innovations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to speak in support of amendment No. 86, which proposes the exclusion from the provisions of the clause of dwellings the market value of which is less than the cost of erecting, acquiring and improving them, or than the outstanding private loan debt on them. The Government have already accepted that there should be an exemption for sales where the private loan debt is greater than the open market vacant possession value of the property, but that is not included in the Bill, as it should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exemption will be of especial value to local housing companies involved in large-scale voluntary transfers—which the Government aim to support—because they have a rising debt profile in their early years. The amendment proposes an exemption
	<br><blockquote><p>"where the cost of provision … of the dwelling … is greater than its open market vacant possession value".</p></blockquote>
Such an exemption has already been accepted in relation to voluntary purchase grant, and it is hard to understand why it should not also apply to the statutory scheme. If tenants can purchase below the cost of providing the property, public funds, associations and letting will suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the local authority right to buy, there is a cost-floor mechanism. That is not proposed for this right to acquire. The direct read-across is therefore broken, and it is not easy to see how a cost floor could operate with the proposed grant and discount system. The amendment proposes a simple and straightforward mechanism—evaluation by an independent valuer—which will easily determine whether a sale can go ahead. That would remove a disincentive on associations to regenerate their stock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The statutory purchase grant scheme has been introduced so that tenants of registered social landlords will have the same kind of right to buy as secure tenants of local authorities, and I do not think it right to introduce a whole new raft of exceptions that would apply only to tenants who are for the first time being given the right to buy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 84 and 123 would exclude properties subject to an affordable housing restriction. Amendment No. 85 would exclude properties where essential repairs were to be carried out in the following three years. Neither of those exceptions applies to the traditional right to buy, which has been operating successfully for 15 years, and I do not commend them for this scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment 86 would exclude properties where the cost of provision or the private loan debt were greater than the open market value. I do not accept the need for the first
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>110</span>
exclusion. Under the purchase grant scheme, landlords will always receive the full market value of any property they sell. We have already accepted the second exception.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confirm that landlords will have a discretion about selling where costs are greater than the outstanding private debt. That will be included in regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power for the Secretary of State proposed in amendment No. 90 to designate further exemptions by order is unnecessary. Clause 16 specifically provides that regulations amending the right-to-buy provisions may make other exceptions, adaptations and modifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have covered the points that were raised, and therefore I advise the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
