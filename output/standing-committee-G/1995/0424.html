	<time>Wednesday 24 April 1996</time>
	<p>[MR. IAIN MILLS 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Public Interest Disclosure Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Mr. John M. Taylor)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Mills. I am aware that there has been doubt or uncertainty expressed about my praying in aid the Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart judgment last week. I would like to take this opportunity to explain my position. Indeed, it is one of the outcomes of that judgment—although it has surely been good practice for much longer—that Ministers should correct or clarify at the earliest possible moment any incorrect or ambiguous statement they may have made inadvertently during a debate in consideration of a Bill. The Minister, for this purpose, is your humble servant, Mr. Mills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should say at the outset that the references that I made were based on my own personal knowledge and understanding of that case and not on advice or guidance that I had been given. It was far from my intention to mislead or confuse and I would therefore wish to clarify my position. I believe that I can. I have since taken advice and looked again at the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The facts of Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart may briefly be stated. It was a tax case heard by the House of Lords Appellate Committee in June 1992 and concerned the liability of schoolteachers to tax in respect of preferential school fees. I realise that that has nothing to do with whistleblowing, but it has to do with what Ministers say in the progress of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the case, the question was raised of interpreting the relevant statute. Until the Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart judgment, the rule of the courts was that references should not be made to debates in Parliament when construing legislation. In any case of ambiguity, it was for the courts, applying a longstanding set of interpretative rules worked out by themselves, to reach a decision on how the legislation was to be interpreted, without consideration of the intentions of Parliament. If that interpretation was not in accordance with the wishes of Parliament, Parliament could amend the legislation clearly to reflect those intentions—but in the meantime, the court's interpretation would apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was support for that rule on both constitutional and practical grounds. My understanding is that the Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart judgment will not change the approach of the courts to interpretation in the large majority of cases where the letter of the law is clear. I am glad to say that, in most cases, there will be no need at all for lawyers to spend long hours rifling through copies of 	<i>Hansard</i> to discover what was said when legislation was first introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
The judgment has given judges a new interpretative tool where the wording of the statute is unclear or ambiguous. Inevitably, that is bound to happen from time to time. I have to say that it would, of course, be preferable to rule out all obscurity from all our statutes. I have great sympathy with the Plain English Campaign and I am aware that our legislative draftsmen and women are making strides in that direction and taking pains to ensure that Acts of Parliament are as clear, precise and easy to understand as is possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been a constant theme of my remarks on this Bill that it is not clear how it may be interpreted. Indeed, the way in which the Bill is structured to depend on the position at common law has the effect that its meaning depends to a large extent on difficult case law. I have to say, however, that it would be difficult—if not impossible—to produce a statute on this subject that was entirely without doubt as to its interpretation. That is not the least reason why I have wished to put on record the Government's intentions in offering amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether I was right in my understanding of the Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart judgment raises an interesting point. There is no doubt that the critical passage in the judgment of the House of Lords in Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart lies in the following words of Lord Browne-Wilkinson, with which six out of seven of their Lordships were in agreement:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In my judgment…reference to parliamentary material should be permitted as an aid to the construction of legislation which is ambiguous or obscure or the literal meaning of which leads to an absurdity. Even in such cases references in court to parliamentary material should only be permitted where such material clearly discloses the mischief aimed at or the legislative intention lying behind the ambiguous or obscure words. In the case of statements made in Parliament, as at present advised I cannot foresee that any statement other than the statement of the Minister or other promoter of the Bill is likely to meet these criteria."</p></blockquote>
I therefore accept that Lord Browne-Wilkinson was thinking in terms of statements made by the Minister or, if he is not the promoter of the Bill, by its other promoter—in this case, the hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Browne-Wilkinson was supported in what he said by Lord Bridge, who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It should in my opinion only be in the rare cases where the very issue of interpretation which the courts are called on to resolve has been addressed in Parliamentary debate and where the promoter of the legislation has made a clear statement directed to that very issue, that reference to Hansard should be permitted."</p></blockquote>
It follows that the courts will look to the statements of the hon. Member for Islwyn for enlightenment as to the intended meaning behind any ambiguities in the Bill, and not directly, if at all, to my statements. That raises an interesting point, because the hon. Gentleman accepted many of my amendments without making any comment on them. That was so, in deed, in the case of amendment No. 1, on which I first raised the issue of Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart. I take it that as the hon Gentleman said nothing on that amendment and the Committee accepted it, the hon. Gentleman and the Committee must have accepted it for the reasons that I gave.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Duncan Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chingford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The case that my hon. Friend refers to—and to some degree the precedent that it sets—is fascinating. I think that it sets the wrong precedent, but with regard to the acceptance of amendments, is it not the case that if that procedure were to be followed, judges would have no reason to refer to 	<i>Hansard</i> if nothing had been said and there was therefore no guidance to be had from 	<i>Hansard?</i> They would then be forced back to the usual procedure of interpreting for themselves. Does not that make the argument in some senses irrelevant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are at an early stage in the development of this area of the law. Other cases will come before the courts and they will have to progress if they are to achieve the same seniority of treatment that was accorded to Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart by the House of Lords. I do not believe that Ministers, in the course of their work in Committee, should necessarily regard that judgment as a self-denying ordinance that means that the safest thing for them to do is to say nothing whatever. That would not be a proper way in which to proceed. It is, however, right to take account of the issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Shepherd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aldridge-Brownhills)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not all this in some sense a red herring? My hon. Friend the Minister made it quite clear—I believe that it was also the Committee's understanding of the law—that the promoter of the Bill leads in such matters. To that extent, the Minister is of no higher standing than any other hon. Member on this Committee. After taking up a great deal of time with his legal exegesis, which he then tells us had no formal backing other than that it was his own thoughts, he now comes to us with a more learned opinion and a more balanced view. In truth, that is all a red herring. If the courts have to look at the proceedings of the Committee, the standing that is given to the observations of my hon. Friend the Minister will be no greater than that given to the observations of any other member of the Committee. Although we are grateful for his burdening or unburdening of the law, would it not be more to the point to continue with the purpose of the Bill—which has been set out clearly and, in a spirit of co-operation, has accommodated the Government's desire to protect an interest that some of us would like to address a little later?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, but I should like to bring my point of order to a conclusion. A constitutional issue is at stake. I believe that a Minister speaking to a piece of legislation, especially to an amendment to that legislation, must be on guard as to what he says for the record. That would be so even if he were not the promoter of the Bill. When a Minister has moved an amendment that the Committee has accepted and he wants to clarify his thinking behind that amendment, he should do so in accordance with the discipline to which I am currently speaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>; Am I to understand from the Minister that the Government now seek to deny to hon. Members the right to silence? May I put it to him that he should certainly not construe the silence of hon. Members, any more than the silence of those whom they represent from time to time, as expressing assent to the Government's propositions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that silence can constitute assent, but I am not sure that one can develop that too far. I am not sure that silence would always connote assent. One can only speculate whether a court considering any possible ambiguity in an amendment might feel able to read the words of Lord Browne-Wilkinson as permitting it to look at what I, the mover of the amendment, had said. May be not and that is certainly the general tenor of the judgment. But what is clear, as the hon. Member for Islwyn did not speak to the amendment, is that guidance as to the intention of Parliament in accepting the amendment would be available in any shape or form only from looking at the observations that I had made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore make no apology for what I said then or what I have said now. Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart is seen by some people to be a landmark judgment. In a personal capacity, I saw it as such and I still do. As a former practitioner of the law I saw it as such and I still do. As a junior Minister I saw it as such and I still do. As junior Minister to the Lord Chancellor in the House of Commons at the time of the judgment I felt poignantly about it and I still do because the one dissenting Law Lord in Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart, sitting in his judicial capacity, was the Lord Chancellor himself. That bore on me hard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not for me, as a member of the Executive, to say any more about that judicial decision except that I thought about it long and carefully. It was never far from my mind at our last sitting because mine were the main contributions. I spoke as a Minister on a matter and amendments to it which cannot possible be said to be free of controversy. I referred to Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart three times last Wednesday and it has come to my notice anecdotally and indirectly that my doing so might be doubted, questioned or pursued or may be the subject of continuing interest. I thought it right to deal with the matter at the first opportunity, as should any Minister who may have doubted, or who thinks he may have been doubted. I believe that I am dealing with the matter in accordance with the scruples of this honourable House and I make the point of order accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we must try to make progress. That point of order was the longest that I have ever heard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Touhig 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islwyn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Mills. I do not wish to detain the Committee. We accepted the Minister's amendments and the reasons for them. I did not interrupt the Minister because he was making a statement in the spirit of clarification. I was confused about some of the comments that he made last week, but he was totally honest with the Committee. I did not doubt his
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0633">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
integrity when he used the Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart judgment to justify his remarks. There is no point in pursuing the matter further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Duncan Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Mills. I shall be brief because there is no merit in prolonging the point. I apologise for arriving a little late. I did not realise that my hon. Friend the Minister was on a point of order. Two colleagues and I intervened. I did not know that we could intervene on a point of order. Perhaps you could clarify the position, Mr. Mills. I apologise for intervening if I should not have done so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not usual to intervene on a point of order, but the circumstances were exceptional. Most members of the Committee who spoke said, "Further to that point of order". When the Minister gave way, I was not sure how long he intended to speak. Can we now move on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only after an apology from me for accepting the interventions. That was even more out of order than testing your patience, Mr. Mills, which I did not intend to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 6</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>BURDEN OF PROOF IN RELATION TO CONFIDENTIALITY</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed [17 April],</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not concluded my remarks by the end of last Wednesday's sitting. You were very gracious, Mr. Mills, in pointing out that it was your duty to call order. I shall not delay the Committee for long. I shall not repeat my earlier comments, but I shall remind the Committee of the Government's reasons for rejecting the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the provision extends beyond the protection of whistleblowers and would affect a range of matters that did not involve victimisation. Secondly, attempting to put a matter of common law into statute would create anomalies. It would treat a public body differently from a private body. There is no justification for such different treatment. It could lead to a lowering of standards and, perhaps, compromise national security. Staff in public bodies may owe a particular duty of competence because of the nature of their work. Special procedures enable those staff to raise anxieties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whistleblowing has been a live issue in the national health service, which is a pertinent example of a public service in which good internal guidance has been provided. The NHS executive issued guidance to staff on relations with the public and the media in June 1993 after extensive consultation. About 3,000 individual comments were considered before the guidance was finalised. A copy of it was placed in the Library of this House and in that of another place. It recommends a framework that all reasonable people would regard as sensible. It balances the rights of staff with the obligations of the employer. Local employers can
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
develop local procedures to handle staff concerns within the framework. It complements the relevant NHS professional ethical guidelines and codes of practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
National health service staff have a right and a duty to raise with their employers anxieties about health service issues. Under no circumstances are employees who express their concerns in accordance with the guidance to be penalised. The guidance stresses that staff concerns should be taken seriously by managers and receive full and sympathetic consideration. It makes plain the basis on which NHS staff should raise issues of concern about the health service. It recognises the major principles of patient confidentiality and the duty of confidentiality and fidelity to the employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
NHS employers are required to introduce procedures for handling staff concerns in accordance with the guidance after full consultation with staff and local staff representatives. The responsibility for introducing local procedures lies with the NHS employer. It is also for each employer to ensure that the board and all managers and staff are fully aware of the guidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Makerfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might assist the Committee to know that there is already a court ruling regarding the confidentiality of medical records and NHS staff. In 1988, a High Court ruling defined the public interest in the disclosure of medical records. It was decided unanimously that the public interest did not outweigh the confidentiality of medical records, a decision that we have all accepted. Consequently, the Minister's argument is irrelevant and erroneous, as a clear definition of access to medical records and their public disclosure has already been provided in statute and by the High Court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point, but I am not sure that all our practice, custom, convention and way of doing things in what we all hope is a civilised society begins and ends with a court judgment reached in 1988. In many areas of our work, we normally look with approval on codes of practice that are worked out between employers and employees, with the interests of third parties—patients, in the case of the NHS—taken into account. Issues are not closed by the provision of a court judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that whatever the codes may say, the practice various enormously from trust to trust. Not all NHS trusts uphold the very high standards in this respect of, for example, the King's trust. Does he accept that in this of all areas, when matters of life and death are at stake, it is peculiarly important for employees to have the protection that this measure would afford them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not without sympathy for the view expressed by the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth). The management of health services and patients is, perhaps, the most critical issue under consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0634">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
You and I have had our own poignant experience of national health trusts, Mr. Mills, in the borough of Solihull, where we are both elected representatives. We have shared a very difficult constituency responsibility regarding Solihull hospital. I do not think that either you or I need reminding any further of how poignant such issues can be. It is in that spirit that I accept and defer to what the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon said in his intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to promote a climate and culture of openness, especially in the national health service, and a dialogue within the national health service so that staff concerns can be dealt with properly and effectively. The guidance does not change or replace nationally agreed terms and conditions of employment, which give particular groups of employees freedom to speak and write, nor does it restrict the publication of clinical or scientific research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be arguing in relation to clause 10(1) that the application of the Bill to the Crown is inappropriate. The Government also believe clause 6 to be wrong in principle. It goes far wider than the rest of the Bill. I am pleased to note that Opposition Members have indicated agreement that the clause should not stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 19 and 21 provide that a court shall not approve settlement terms that impose a condition of confidentiality in respect of accurate information subject to protected disclosure. Such terms, if not approved by a court, shall be unenforceable. The Bill would otherwise provide that settlement terms were unenforceable even when they had been approved by a court, which is unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 20 replaces the subjective test of "protected disclosure" when it has
	<br><blockquote><p>"not been shown to be inaccurate"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
with an objective test that such a disclosure "is not" inaccurate. Clause 7 would render unenforceable any term of a settlement that purports to impose a condition of confidentiality on particular information that was subject to a protected disclosure that has not been shown to be inaccurate. I shall clarify why the Bill needs to be amended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 19 and 21 deal with enforceability of a settlement when it has been approved by a court. The problem is that courts often make orders based on settlement terms. To provide that terms of a settlement are unenforceable even where they have been endorsed by a court is wrong in principle. That would undermine the court's authority and run counter to the court's decision. Such a contradictory situation cannot be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Courts have considerable expertise on settlement terms. Sometimes, complex terms relating to restraint of trade may form part of a settlement package. The courts will consider the terms reasonableness and will consider the facts of the case in deciding whether to endorse the terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 19 and 21 deal with an undesirable state of affairs. First, they provide that courts shall not in any case provide terms of settlement of the sort referred to in the Bill—that is, gagging terms—which purport to restrict an individual's ability to make public some information that would be subject to protected disclosure. Secondly, such terms, if not so approved, shall be unenforceable. The employer would be unable to rely on any such gagging terms even if he succeeded in having them included in the settlement. An individual would be at liberty to act as if no such terms had been included. That would have no effect on the individual's ability to enforce the remainder of the terms of the settlement against the employer. The overall effect of amendments Nos. 19 and 21 would, therefore, be clearly in line with the Bill's intention. I welcome the suggestion that the Committee will accept them in the helpful spirit in which they are intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 20 is directed at a different point. I have said that gagging terms would be unenforceable where they related to information that was the subject of a protected disclosure under the Bill. However, that does not and should not apply where the information is wrong. In such a case, we must recognise that employers should have some protection against the publication of information that, in being misguided or simply inaccurate, could be immensely damaging. The employees concerned may be acting in good faith—indeed, they would have been doing so up to that point if they were to enjoy the protection of the Bill—but it would be wrong to require an employer to pay out sums under a settlement while, at the same time, the beneficiary of the settlement was perhaps costing the employer further large sums and damage to the business by spreading false information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present draft of the Bill acknowledges that point, but it does so in an undesirably subjective and uncertain way. All through the Bill, the Government
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0635">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
have attempted, in their amendments, to remove subjective tests and to replace them with objective ones. Amendment No. 20 is another example. The Bill's subjective test of a protected disclosure refers to information that
	<br><blockquote><p>"has not been shown to be inaccurate".</p></blockquote>
That raises questions such as, "Shown to whom?". The amendment would replace that uncertainty with the objective test that such a disclosure is not inaccurate. Although it may not always be such a simple matter to decide such issues, they relate to matters of fact that courts and tribunals are well able to resolve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I applaud the Minister's determination to uphold the authority of courts of law. That is entirely in keeping with everything that we know about his personal disposition. However, is that not somewhat at odds with the Deputy Prime Minister's petulant attitude when he recently deplored the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in a politically controversial case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I speak more personally rather than as a Minister? I have slightly mixed feelings about the European Court of Human Rights because I am aware of the fact that if any single country and its authorities could be accused of standing as authors of the European convention on human rights, it would be this country. It had more to do with the draftmanship and the authorship of the convention than anyone else. We were the first to initial the European convention on human rights and we were the first to ratify it. The second country to do that was Norway. One is bound to have mixed feelings about something when one's adoptive parenthood stands out quite strikingly, but when one is sometimes unhappy about the results that are handed down by that court. I have mixed feelings and I share them with the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the Minister has said, with which I entirely concur, would not it be appropriate for us to incorporate the European convention on human rights into our domestic law so that we could repatriate that element of judicial authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Shepherd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Mills.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will call the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon. There is some doubt in my mind, but I have been advised that a lengthy debate on the European Court of Human Rights would not fall within the debates on amendments Nos. 19, 20 and 21. I am sure that the Committee will understand that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Mills, for calling me on a point that is germane to the point of order raised by the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd). I fully defer to your opinion, and that of the Committee, that to embark on
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
a debate on the European convention on human rights and the desirability of its incorporation into domestic law somewhat stretches the scope of the debate on the amendments. I thought, however, that it might be pertinent to allude to that issue because the European convention on human rights contains important provisions on the freedom of speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I think that these are important constitutional points. There is no one with whom I would more readily wish to discuss such matters in this Committee or on an informal occasion than the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon or other members of the Committee. They are compelling issues of our times. If this were a debating society rather than a Standing Committee, it would not be difficult to make out a case for incorporating the European convention on human rights into English law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we leave this point—we should do so, and I know that you, Mr. Mills, will counsel me to do so—it is necessary to consider the extent to which we would be inserting the judiciary into the political process. To some extent, that would turn the judiciary into an equivalent of the American Supreme Court. It would have a long-stop role in our political and Executive decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I promise, Mr. Mills, that this will be the last time that I intervene on the Minister. There would be less necessity to insert the judiciary into the political process if Parliament and Government could be better depended upon to uphold the civil rights of citizens of this country. That is what the Bill is very much about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nobody has a more pristine record in speaking for the rights of the disadvantaged than the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an intervention on the Minister. It is almost unique in that it deals with issues raised by the Bill. It may be because I did not attend the Committee's previous sitting, but I am unclear whether the amendments cover cases in which somebody continues to talk about behaviour that has been corrected. Such talk has the potential to continue to damage an institution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider a hypothetical example. If allegations were constantly repeated that abuse had taken place in an old people's home even though the abuse had been dealt with, the perpetrators removed and the settlement paid, would it be possible, under the

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend made a particularly germane intervention. My understanding is that if proper procedures had been followed and internal remedies sought, thereafter, a need to make statements and clarify issues would be justified, and most of us would say that that was rightly so. It is hard to prescribe and delimit in the text of a statute what circumstances would meet with general approval and what would not. That is part of our struggle in the Committee. The struggle goes on, but, at this stage, I do not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not my intention, the Committee may be pleased to note, to detain it for eternity, but I have a few brief words to say about clause 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful if I set out the existing law on the disclosure of sources before I explain why clause 8 should not stand part of the Bill. Section 10 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 provides protection for journalists and others from the disclosure of their sources. Like much legislation on this subject, where there are conflicting rights and freedoms, it performs a balancing exercise. The basic principle is that it is not to be a contempt of court for a person to refuse to disclose the source of information in a publication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
There are exceptions. A person may be required to disclose his source if the court considers it necessary in the interests of justice or national security or for the prevention of disorder or crime, all of which can be said to be examples of the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 8 requires the court to form a view on whether publication of information is in the public interest. If it decides that it is, disclosure of the source of information is not to be regarded as required in the interests of justice. I accept that there may be some cases in which that will be so, but I do not accept that it will necessarily be the case. It would be far better to leave it to the courts to decide according to the facts of each case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, it may well be that in order to decide whether publication is in the public interest the court will need to know the source of the information. The second part of the clause would prevent the court from deciding whether the clause applies at all. The clause is thus illogical. Section 10 of the 1981 Act, by contrast, leaves the questions of disclosure of sources and the various categories of public interest to be considered together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my opinion, and that of the Government, the clause is not necessary to achieve the main purpose of the Bill. It is expressed in unacceptably absolute terms. Section 10 of the 1981 Act provides the right balance and does what is needed. I urge the Committee to agree that the clause should not stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That is important not just to the House and to those who support the Bill but to those who will be affected by it—employers, in particular. I should be interested if the Minister could give us some idea of the reasoning behind the amendment which has been accepted. Could he tell us what time table he has in mind for the implementation of the Bill if it becomes an Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I must reply to that question with a proper degree of humility. It is not for Ministers to prescribe the coming into effect of a piece of legislation promoted by a private Member. That would be a presumption by a Minister in the face of the overall authority of Parliament. It is for Parliament to decide when legislation should come into effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that that is the case.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put it to the Minister that he was just propounding what seemed to be the novel doctrine that Ministers do not take an interest in the time scale for the implementation of a private Member's Bill? Will he bear in mind that the implementation of a private Member's Bill on disability matters introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) and enacted by Parliament some 10 years ago has been frustrated by the Government for exactly 10 years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am unravelled by the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon who places me in a position of considerable discomfiture. I was saying when I gave way to him that the effect of Government amendment No. 27 is to delete clause 10(4) which brings the Bill into effect on 1 January 1997 and substitutes in its place an order-making power for the Secretary of State
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
to bring it into effect on the day appointed in a statutory instrument and to appoint different days for different purposes. That is the answer as things stand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for not having been here for most of this morning. I am also serving on European Standing Committee B next door. May I put it to the Minister that it might be useful to hear what the different purposes of the Bill are that might need to be brought in on different dates? If there is one purpose in the Bill that could be brought into effect on one day, and if it is just a question of 1 January 1997 being too late and the Government want to do it earlier, it would be useful to hear that. If they want to do it significantly later, it would be useful to hear that, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is common practice for Bills of this sort to be commenced on the date appointed by statutory instrument rather than on a fixed date. That is a desirable practice to ensure that everything is ready for the Bill to come into effect. The provisions of some legislation may require secondary legislation such as rules of procedure to be enacted before they can operate as intended. Many Bills need to be published so that those who will be affected by them are aware of their existence. That may enable them to prepare properly to take any necessary steps to comply with, or perhaps to enforce, new rights that they may be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Guidance material may need to be prepared to assist those who have new rights or duties. Enforcement authorities may be trying to gear up to their new functions, to acquaint themselves with the legislation, to train staff, and so on. An order-making power also enables the Secretary of State to bring some provisions into operation before others, where appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although not all those considerations apply to the Bill, its provisions are quite novel and potentially far reaching. Employers, employees and others will need to acquaint themselves with its provisions and, where necessary, adjust their procedures and practices accordingly. The Secretary of State will need to take a judgment on the appropriate period to allow, after enactment, for these processes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has given very good reasons why it may be inappropriate to have a fixed date for the provisions to come into effect, but will he confirm that, as soon as the Bill becomes law, he and his Department will initiate steps to enable its provisions to come into effect at a very early date?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I would give an affirmative response to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, I put it to the Minister that if there were a proposal to include in the primary legislation a date by which the provisions would apply in the private and public sectors, I suspect that that might be acceptable to the Committee. I suspect that if no date is included in the primary legislation, people may believe that matters will drift on and on. It might be better to leave the provision as it stands and allow consideration of the matter in

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it extraordinary that the Government want to remove from the Bill the provisions that would apply to the Crown. We heard much in last week's debate about the effects of the measure on business and industry, and have touched on it this morning. As I said last week, I ran a small company before coming to this place. I am sure that many people who run businesses in industry today would find it extraordinary if we said, "This piece of legislation applies to all you people in business and industry, but not to us—the Crown." That might be difficult for them to comprehend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have accepted the Nolan recommendations on standards in public life. They have set up safe reporting schemes for civil servants. The only reason why the Minister's scheme should not apply to civil servants is if the Government wish to reserve the right to refuse to investigate, let alone act on, concerns about serious misconduct. The Government should give a lead to the country, especially to the private sector, by agreeing that the Bill should apply to Her Majesty's Government. How can civil servants be expected to have confidence in the Government's new schemes if they alone are denied the limited protection that the Bill offers private sector employees? The Government's approach will not encourage a civil servant who suspects serious fraud or wrongdoing. Whitehall frauds that are discovered currently involve £2 million per annum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister to reconsider. The Bill should apply to the Crown as well as to the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the whole, I agree with the promoter of the Bill. Arguments took place about Crown immunity covering hospitals and other places, but we have managed to survive changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can envisage some difficulties. Let us suppose that a Government agency was authorised and expected to carry out activities that would otherwise be against the law. Such a responsibility may be part of the duties of some of the security agencies. They would not wish all arguments about authority to be heard in public. I am not impressed by Peter Wright's arguments about "Spycatcher". He tried to carry out activities that were not only unauthorised but designed to destabilise the Government. He then gained notoriety by writing a book that explained that he had done things that, he argued, should not have been done. That is tautologous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that the Government are responsible for the public service brings us to the arguments that were epitomised by the First Division Association's examination of the need for a revised code of ethics. The former head of the civil service may have suggested to the Government that that proposal should be accepted. I do not know whether the proposal was presented to the Government, but it was not accepted. I believe that it should be accepted. If the Government, in association with the representatives of public servants, were able to agree a code that would have the effect of the Bill, I would like to hear the arguments for it. It could provide an alternative method of tackling the delicacy of some parts of Government service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill could apply without such difficulties to ' many parts of the public service. An advantage of the many stages of proposed legislation is that when a government are convinced that a Bill is likely to be enacted—I hope that the present measure will be enacted in the current Session—they can concentrate on the best ways in which to achieve the aims that the House accepts while making them compatible with public administration. The best way to maintain pressure is to resist the amendment and to allow government, in its widest sense, to work out ways of fulfilling the wishes of the House and the public, while bearing in mind the points in the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In public service it must be clear whether an offence or breach of a statutory requirement or legal obligation exists. That is not a particular problem. Let us consider the improper or unauthorised use of public or other funds. The Bill provides for people to take up issues within their organisations. But, in unsuccessful cases, it would be in the public interest for the Bill to apply to a civil or public servant who believed that the matter should be made public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Abuse of authority will always be a difficult question. It would remain a problem if the Bill did not exist. Miscarriages of justice fall squarely within the Bill's remit. The aims of the Bill cover someone who works in the Crown Prosecution Service or in the police service and believes that information should be made available in the interests of justice, to get those
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0639">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
who have committed an offence convicted or those who have not acquitted even if that requires a late appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On maladministration, we have the ombudsman; the Government are able to argue that that is an alternative way to deal with a difficulty in the public service, although it does not apply to the private sector. On health and safety, a de minimis provision might come in but if, say, someone had found out about the BSE problem and could get no one to pay attention, I should regard disclosure as a public service. Or if someone had found out about CJD and growth hormones being transferred through pituitary glands, I should regard that as important. All the time, people are trying to shake others out of apathy, complacency or ignorance. People in the public service ought to be prepared to make sacrifices for what they believe important. But perhaps I am dealing with the penumbra, slightly outside the amendment, Mr. Mills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I advise the Committee not to accept my hon. Friend's amendment but to keep the pressure on. If the Government believe that some areas ought to be excluded from the Bill, and if they can satisfy the Committee or the House that those areas can be dealt with in other ways, some modification may be possible. But we should presume, in principle, that the Bill will cover the public sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with much of what the hon. Gentleman said. The Minister, whose commitment to integrity in public life the whole House holds in the highest regard, has failed to appreciate the extent of public disquiet and dismay about the governance of the United Kingdom. Recent years have seen enormous growth in the power of the central Executive, which has claimed the rights of royal prerogative and, arguably, has escaped accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The history of Parliament is one of challenge to the absolutist pretensions of the Crown over two or three centuries. During this century—and particularly during its second half—Parliament has given away much that it had gained in those constitutional struggles. It is critical that we recover real accountability to protect the liberties of our people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why so many people give three cheers for judges who from time to time—but all too frequently—feel compelled to challenge the Executive. It is extraordinarily important that we should have freedom of information legislation. That is why we are in enormous debt to my hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn for introducing a Bill to protect the rights of whistleblowers who expose malpractice and the abuse of power. That principle must be the same whether the abuse of power occurs in the public or private sectors. It must apply if the abuse of power is perpetrated in the name of the Crown, in which case it is even more objectionable than other such abuses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is dispiriting that Ministers still fail to understand how deeply scandalised people have been by the revelations in the Scott report. The Government have pronounced their verdict, and have acquitted Ministers of improper conduct. But they have not, by the same token, acquitted civil servants; the possibility remains that individuals will be pursued and
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
disciplined for matters described in the Scott report. There is a constitutional doctrine that Ministers are responsible for the actions of civil servants in public matters, so the Government's position is deplorable. We cannot respect or accept that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not detain the Committee at length, but I want to mention the new code of conduct introduced in January, which governs the rights of civil servants who might want to make complaints about matters related to the Government that they consider to be against the public interest. I am willing to be corrected if I am wrong, but I understand that the new code provides an extended right to civil servants to take their complaints, if necessary, to the Civil Service Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a minute. I shall finish this point and then I will be happy to hear the Minister's response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the present position to be that even if a civil servant takes his complaint to the Civil Service Commission and is still dissatisfied, under the code he is not at liberty to divulge the matter about which he is dissatisfied. The civil servant is required to forfeit his job and go to his grave without revealing what he, in all good conscience, regarded as malpractice or abuse on the part of Government which runs against the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extremely important that subsection (1) should be enacted as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon if I sought to intervene at an inappropriate moment. I sought merely to confirm his understanding of the civil service code. What he said, slightly speculatively, was correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already unburdened myself as far as amendment No. 27 is concerned. On amendment No. 26, I stress that the application of this measure to the Crown would be inappropriate for various reasons that were well-rehearsed in the aftermath of Lord Nolan's first report. It is undoubtedly preferable to develop sound procedures that will enable Crown servants internally to voice concerns about malpractice and fraud. The Government would not want to encourage vexatious or irresponsible complaints in public which could undermine public confidence in institutions without due cause. Public whistleblowing puts the employee at most potential risk from media intrusion and possible repercussions in the workplace. Public disclosures weaken the cohesiveness of civil service bodies and the relationship of mutual trust between Ministers and civil servants, as in other professional advisory relationships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, civil service codes issued this year contain broad-ranging provisions whereby a civil servant can report internally, ultimately to the independent Civil Service Commission, any requirement to act in a way that for him or her raises a fundamental issue of confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0640">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
I will press my amendment, but I assure the Committee that I have heard some persuasive, interesting and compelling arguments this morning. I shall take those away, reflect on them and weigh them before we come to remaining stages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the Minister's arguments for pressing the amendments, and in particular, his analysis of the Nolan committee. If I remember correctly, the Government accepted without reservation the Nolan recommendations for the creation of internal whistleblowing channels. They also accepted that the circumstances under which a public servant can take action to highlight a malpractice or a potential illegal act should be clearly set down. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon said, and as the Minister accepted as speculative but accurate, it is intended under the revised code of practice still to prevent civil servants in some circumstances from placing in the public domain information that in all conscience belongs there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that one of the main reasons for the Government's desire to remove subsection (1) is to prevent civil servants from using the legislation to disclose matters that they are not allowed under internal civil service procedures to put into the public domain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gave no indication of the possible impact of the removal of the subsection on a range of Government agencies that spend large sums of taxpayers' money and are increasingly involved in working with the public—be it the Benefits Agency or other agencies that provide goods and services or act under Government contractual arrangements and utilise public finance resources. He has not said whether he believes that the removal of subsection (1) would affect all civil servants working for current agencies or agencies that are to be created in the final stages of the next steps agency programme. Would quangos no longer be covered? That is important, not just in relation to quangos set up directly to act on behalf of a Secretary of State but in relation to those that exist for the sole purpose of distributing public resources, either by short-term or by longer-term contractual arrangements—for example, training and enterprise councils and health service trusts. There is a whole range of public bodies that spend billions of pounds each year in providing goods and services, yet the Minister has not said whether they would be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The removal of the subsection would also place us in a two-tier system in the public domain. What happens if local government bodies have to comply with disclosure rules but Her Majesty's Government do not? Where does that place us in terms of continuity of standards in public life?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be seen as a narrow interpretation, but I have always taken the view that the Bill is essentially about crime prevention. Any Government, of whatever political persuasion, must be constantly on the alert
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
for internal criminal activity, carried out either within Departments or by organisations or bodies that have contractual arrangements with the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Crime continues to increase and it places a huge burden on the taxpayer, who suffers a loss in terms both of goods and services and of the sums of money that go astray because of malpractice and illegal activity. It would be in the Government's own interest, as an employer, as a provider and procurer of services and as a protector of the public purse, to ensure in all circumstances that the Crown had a method and a programme by means of which to root out criminal activity and bring the perpetrators to justice. The Government have a duty, in my view, to work with their employees to ensure that the internal systems are vigorous and that nothing is done to undermine the pursuit of criminal activity or malpractice. The removal of subsection (1) would undermine that drive. It is to the credit of Lord Prior that he was the first Secretary of State for Employment, of any political persuasion, to tackle Crown immunity. A range of people in the House and other places—they were conservative with a small "c"—opposed him, saying that there would be a collapse of government if Crown immunity were not maintained. Government has not collapsed. We have not yet been vigorous enough but have been able to bring accountability to the public into a whole range of Government Departments and services where it did not previously exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extraordinary, therefore, after more than a decade of systematically getting rid of Crown immunity that a Minister is today trying to put the cork back in the genie's bottle. That is the kindest interpretation I can place on what he is doing; at worst, he is trying to make sure that the new civil service code of conduct, agreed before the Nolan inquiry, will be no more than a piece of paper so that a civil servant who comes to the crunch of putting information into the public domain will be prevented from doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although my hon. Friend the Minister intends to press the amendment, we should not exaggerate the difficulties in the civil service. There is an open system and those who deal with policy advice or are heads of agencies have access to Ministers. In general, Ministers are open with information, especially within the agency system. There has been progress; the question is whether we can move further forward and whether the Bill will encourage people to run their systems as they say they are running them. It is important not to catch people out, but to build on the existing ethos of the public service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of my hon. Friend's arguments apply equally well to auditors, lawyers and ministers of religion who have information about someone who is doing something wrong. They have just as much duty of confidentiality and trust as public servants. I hope that they will feel able to use the Bill, if they have taken steps earlier within their own systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not underestimate the difficulties of deciding how the Bill will apply within Departments of state. Indeed, I doubt if that has been looked at yet; I suspect
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0641">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
that that is why my hon. Friend cannot withdraw his amendment. But if the provision remains in the Bill, people will start to pay attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the spirit of openness, I want—openly—to foresee a problem that will arise later in the parliamentary Session if the Government tell the hon. Member for Islwyn that his Bill can go through if the public sector is not included. We may need to face that dilemma later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Recommendation 23 of the Nolan report said that the Government accepted that the civil service code should be revised to place
	<br><blockquote><p>"a duty on civil servants to report unlawful activity and a right to report other (malpractice or administration)".</p></blockquote>
I endorse that and welcome the Minister's comments on amendment No. 26. He is happy to consider what the Committee has heard and may come forward with another proposal on Report. I note that he still wants to pursue the amendment, however.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Prime Minister has said that he is keen to improve scrutiny of the public sector following the Scott report, and we all endorse that. The Bill underpins changes that the Government have introduced including the code of practice on open government and new whistleblowing procedures in the civil service. Those have been introduced for Whitehall, and the Government have pledged to spread them across the public sector. I am worried that, if we accept the Minister's amendment, we are in danger of introducing a piece of legislation that will offer a certain degree of protection to some of our citizens, but not to others. That will be difficult to justify. It is dangerous to consider enacting laws that should apply across the board to all our citizens, but would not offer that protection to all of them. That is why I urge hon. Members to resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to delay the Committee but there are a couple of points to which I should reply. As the hon. Member for Islwyn kindly acknowledged, I said that I would reflect on points made today. I must emphasise that the new civil service code was drawn up in the light of the Nolan report after extensive consultation. It is not just a piece of paper as one hon. Member described it; it provides an appeal to an independent body. It is a very considered response and it should not be overturned or discarded lightly without the most thorough reflection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accepted the substance of all the Nolan committee recommendations. These were: that the code should cover wrongdoing of which a civil servant is aware even though not personally involved; that there should be wider reporting of appeals by the civil service commissioners; that there should be a confidential appeal channel independent of the civil servant's line management; and that introduction should be as soon as possible. I do not wish to detain the Committee. I have deployed my arguments. There may still be differences and there may necessarily be a Division, but I hold to my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Mills. Both the promoter of the Bill and the Minister have helped the Committee greatly. The Bill has been improved in Committee. I have no doubt that other matters will be taken further into consideration at later stages as it moves through this House and the House of Lords.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Mills. I concur with the remarks of the hon. Member for Eltham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Bill is reported to the House, it might be helpful to the Committee if the Minister told us of the processes in which he is prepared to get involved between now and the Bill returning to the Floor of the House. The Minister has said that the Government want to take a fresh look at certain matters. When moving probing amendments he listened to and seemed to take on board comments from hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. On some issues, the Government have not seen the case for some provisions, but they have not been able to persuade the promoter or the Committee to withdraw or to accept amendments. Therefore, it would be useful if the Minister gave us an idea of the processes in which he will engage to ensure that proper debate takes place on any proposals that the Government may wish to put before the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister comes before the House, will he give us an idea of the timetable for implementation? That is important not so much for ourselves and those who support the Bill—even though that is important in itself—but for those who will be affected by it. If the Bill becomes an Act, it is important that those who are affected by it have a clear indication of the role and duty of the Secretary of State in implementing it. If the Minister can answer some of these points before we finish our consideration of the Bill this morning, that would be helpful to all of us who want to give the Bill a fair wind on the Floor of the House and the maximum opportunity to become law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I feel obliged to say something just to prove that I am here, having almost been omitted from the vote. I should like to ask the Minister to convert some of the helpfulness that has been revealed on both sides of the Committee into the future progress of the Bill. It is hard to feel disagreeable towards the Minister, who is such a genial—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Shepherd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Cove."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fellow. I was trying to avoid "cove", which I always see as a George Galloway word, if I am allowed to say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rather P. G. Wodehouse, perhaps?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us not get too carried away. [	<i>Laughter.</i>] It is very hard to feel personally disputatious with the Minister. He has, at various times, lectured us—in the nicest possible way—on Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart. I feel that I am now an authority on Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart, having heard so much about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman want more?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at the moment. Perhaps we could have extra-mural classes later on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point of Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart, as the Minister has explained, is that people should know what goes on inside this place and, in particular, what Ministers say. Acts may be construed by judges at some point, when reference is made back to Ministers. I think that people should also be aware of what is happening to this Bill in the House. That should be on the record too. We do not yet know the end of the story, but we know a good part of it. People elect us and send us here to do various things, such as implementing what they regard as beneficient legislation, They know about the procedures that allow that to happen, but they should also know what happens, in practice, to some measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that context, let me record that here is a private Member's Bill, admirably promoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn, which received overwhelming support. Indeed, not a dissenting vote was cast on Second Reading. The Minister himself has told us how compelling the arguments were, although he could not find it in his heart to agree with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An hon. Member who was in the top six in the golden arena of the ballot has brought forward a measure that received unanimous support on Second Reading. The measure has been consulted on widely throughout the country, in the public and private sectors. It has been smiled on by the Nolan process and endorsed by everyone. It has been much discussed and is much wanted. And yet we discover that the Government are consistently unhelpful, despite the Minister's genial approach in Committee. I have heard dark rumours—let them not be true—that it was a struggle even to get the Bill into Committee at an appropriate time because of enormous delays and deliberate unhelpfulness. We do not know whether it will be possible for the Government to help the Bill's passage to Report stage. Will there be a slot in the House for this product of the Committee stage to be debated again by all right hon. and hon. Members?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want those points to go on the record, along with Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart, because I think that people will want to know what happened. They will say, "The Bill had overwhelming support in the country and the House of Commons. What happened to it?" In addition to the mutual congratulation that is always engaged in at the end of a Committee stage of a Bill, it should be put on record that the end of the story has not yet happened.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0643">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
There is many a slip, as we say. I suspect that one of those slips will be a concerted Government action to prevent the Bill coming into effect despite the overwhelming will of Parliament. I should like to place that fear on record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Mills. There is a lot of pepper in the Bill and I take heart from the encouragement and support that I have received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Echoing the comments made by other hon. Members, I hope that the Government will feel able to take up the offer that I made early in the proceedings for my sponsors and I to sit down with Ministers and civil servants to see how the Bill can be improved and how we can get support for it on Third Reading. The Minister spoke this morning of his genuine willingness to try to achieve that. I can say only that the offer is still there. I hope that the Government will make an empty response because people who are interested in the Bill, including hon. Members—on Second Reading they voted in favour of the Bill by 118 votes to nil—and those outside the House who have been watching the Bill's progress, will not understand if the Government fail to respond to the sponsors' offer to sit down with them to get the Bill through Third Reading. The offer is there. My address is 3 Dean's yard and I can give my extension number to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, Mr. Mills, I thank you for the way in which you have chaired the two sittings of the Committee. This is my first private Member's Bill. I have been very green and there was a steep learning curve, but your help, advice and guidance have been absolutely invaluable. I appreciate that and I am sure that other hon. Members do, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M.

On Second Reading I was part of the nil. I accept that that does not give great strength to my arm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has been a matter of sustained attention and reflection on my part and I assure the hon. Member for Islwyn that it will continue to be so.

There are now only two processes that I should like to complete. One is to thank the hon. Member for Islwyn for his sincerity, commitment and unfailing courtesy. The other is to thank you, Mr. Mills, for your courtesy and careful leadership of our affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Mills. The Minister has been generous to me this morning. I put it to him that the further passage of the Bill is at risk because of the notorious lack of parliamentary time made available for private Members' Bills. In this Session the Government have a relatively light legislative programme and there is an abundance of parliamentary time for hon. Members to resume their scrutiny of the Bill on Report. Will the Minister give an undertaking to the Committee, in the spirit of generosity that he has already displayed in previous proceedings, to use his best endeavours to persuade the Government's business managers to allow Government time to be made available for Parliament's further consideration of the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
