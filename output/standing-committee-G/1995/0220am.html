</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This group of amendments covers the extremely important issue of the licensing of houses in multiple occupation. Unless you wish me to, Mr. McWilliam, I do not propose to explain in detail each amendment, otherwise we would be in Committee for a long time. The amendments would introduce a mandatory national licensing scheme for HMOs. It is right to introduce such a scheme and to see it in the context of the current arrangements in multi-occupied houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As their name implies, houses in multiple occupation are properties in which more than one separate household lives. In the main, they comprise houses converted into bed-sitting rooms, shared houses or flats,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0118">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>197</span>
guest houses and bed-and-breakfast hotels including some that derive their income almost exclusively from people on income support and other social security benefit, households with lodgers and buildings that have been converted into self-contained flats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of multi-occupied houses in England was estimated recently by the Department of the Environment at 638,000, which is slightly less than the estimate that was issued by the Government in November 1994 at the time of the consultation paper to which I shall return in a moment. That figures denotes the large scale of the problem in that 638,000 HMOs contain a greater number of people than that because, in many cases, they contain several tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is recognised universally that HMOs have some of the worst housing conditions and, thus, put at risk more people's safety and lives than any other housing. The Government's consultation paper that was issued in November 1994 made that point. It stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"estimates from the English House Condition Survey suggest that the privately rented HMO stock contains a significantly greater proportionate share of dwellings in poor condition than other forms of housing."</p></blockquote>
It goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"there is little dispute that HMOs represent a significantly higher fire risk than single family homes."</p></blockquote>
To put a little more flesh on those bare bones, I must stress that four out of 10 of the traditional HMOs—properties converted into bed-sitters—are known to be statutorily unfit; 40 per cent. of them are unfit for human habitation. Fire and safety hazards are massively greater in HMOs than in housing stock elsewhere. The Campaign for Bedsit Rights has been unstinting in its hard work to draw public attention to the scandal of poor conditions in such properties. In a report that it commissioned from Geoffrey Randall last year, it was estimated that the risk of someone being killed or injured by fire in an HMO was 28 times higher than in other types of accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Housing and Town Planning Council published a report about a year ago, which was entitled "Potential Death Traps"—a title that encapsulates the problem. It outlined a particular problem and stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As we go to the press, we read of yet another two deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning over Christmas, and of a court case following the death of two brothers also from CO after a landlord made a 'dangerously amateurish attempt' to mend a faulty central heating boiler. In the first case, a couple were gassed in each other's arms while watching a video. Their death was only discovered when they failed to turn up for Christmas lunch—they had been fine the previous evening. Unnecessary deaths from fire are so commonplace that they are often not even newsworthy."</p></blockquote>
The report goes on to highlight several areas, including Brighton. The National Housing and Town Planning Council stresses that Brighton
	<br><blockquote><p>"is typical of many apparently affluent towns. A house condition survey in September 1994 identified 18,000 HMOs, comprising 15,400 converted flats and 2,600 bedsit houses … According to Trevor Sennett. Brighton's Private Sector Team Manager, all the latter HMO category failed one or more of the issues of fitness under the Housing Act 1985 as amended and the majority require fire safety work. In the converted house category, 80 per cent. require some expenditure to provide satisfactory means of escape and other fire precautions. In many cases this involves upgrading to meet current DoE guidance under circular 12/92."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>198</span>
That, in graphic detail, shows the scale of the problem—the poor conditions and the threats to life caused by fire or other hazards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that there is any difference in view between the Opposition and the Government on the extent of the problem. It is widely recognised that conditions in HMOs are unsatisfactory and that action must be taken. Indeed, as I have already mentioned, the Government published a consultation paper in November 1994, which had an interesting title: "Houses in Multiple Occupation—The Case for Licensing". Why were the Government interested in the possibility of a licensing scheme for HMOs? The prime reason, spelt out in that consultation paper and in many other documents published on the subject, can be summed up under two headings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the current legislative framework is unsatisfactory. It is complex and confusing. Seventeen regulations or Acts of Parliament have to be applied, and local authorities do not find the regime easy to operate. Secondly, the current framework is regarded as inherently inefficient because it depends on tenants lodging complaints or on local authorities identifying problems. There is no obligation on the landlords of such properties o obtain licences, which would enable the public authorities, in the process of licensing, to discover whether or no risks existed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government recognised in the consultation paper that such a case pertains. Paragraph 19 sets out the arguments for licensing. Ministers may be worried that I shall be partial; I assure them that I shall shortly deal with the other side of the coin—the arguments against licensing. I shall be utterly even-handed, but the Committee should be aware of what the Government said in their 1994 consultation paper. The Government's arguments for licensing were, first that it would
	<br><blockquote><p>"secure high standards throughout the licensed HMO sector. As with current HMO powers there would be an emphasis on the more consistent enforcement of fire safety standards, both the provision of the basic amenities to ensure minimum health and hygiene standards would also be included".</p></blockquote>
Secondly, licensing would
	<br><blockquote><p>"prevent the undesirable proliferation of hostels catering primarily for benefit recipients in resort areas"—</p></blockquote>
something of widespread concern, but particularly important to hon. Members who represent such areas. Thirdly, licensing would
	<br><blockquote><p>"focus any regulatory regime on those areas and types of housing with the worst problems, and hence make possible the removal of planning controls which apply uniformly nationally".</p></blockquote>
Fourthly, it would
	<br><blockquote><p>"clarify the regulatory regime so that landlords and tenants know as far as possible which properties need to be licensed and what standards are acceptable".</p></blockquote>
Finally, it would
	<br><blockquote><p>"ensure a more consistent approach to the HMO sector, which recognises the value of HMOs in meeting a particular housing need and which is reflected in local housing and planning strategies."</p></blockquote>
That was the Government's case for licensing HMOs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph 22, the Government set out the arguments against licensing HMOs. Against I shall quote in full, and not selectively. Sir Richard Scott need not come to this Committee, as the quotations will be absolutely straight and comprehensive. The first argument against licensing is that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0119">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>199</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"it would add little to the powers already available to local authorities. These can be exercised flexibly and tackle those properties which represent the greatest risk. Licensing would reduce this degree of flexibility by requiring local authorities to deal with all HMOs, so making it more difficult to concentrate on those properties most at risk".</p></blockquote>
The second argument against licensing is that,
	<br><blockquote><p>"as with current registration schemes it would create excessive bureaucracy which would have to be paid for. Only the better landlords would agree to register and the remaining landlords would, as now, refuse to come forward. There would therefore be no significant improvement in the condition of standards of HMO properties as a direct result of licensing".</p></blockquote>
Thirdly, licensing
	<br><blockquote><p>"would be introducing to high a degree of regulation into a market where both landlord and tenant are willing to agree on a reasonable standard of accommodation, particularly in relation to matters not directly affecting fire safety. Raising standards to an unrealistically high level in all cases would mean that either the landlord would withdraw accommodation from the market or the tenants would be unable to afford the higher rents that higher standards could imply."</p></blockquote>
Those were the arguments against a national licensing scheme set out by the Government in their consultation paper. Let us consider those arguments carefully. The first was that licensing is not necessary as
	<br><blockquote><p>"it would add little too the powers already available to local authorities".</p></blockquote>
The Government do not believe that. If they did, they would not be introducing the changes proposed in part II of the Bill. By proposing measures to toughen the registration regime, the Government have conceded that the existing framework is not satisfactory and that there is a need to change existing powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to flexibility to deal with the worst cases, everyone agrees that whichever system is operated, be it licensing or registration, it is essential for the body responsible—the local authority—to operate on the principle of first priority being given to the properties in the worst condition, usually on the basis of a risk assessment strategy. Concentrating on the properties in the worst condition will be common to whichever approach is adopted. That part of the argument is no case against a licensing scheme, and the Bill disproves the argument that licensing would add little to local authorities' existing powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the argument that licensing would create excessive bureaucracy. If that it the case, why are the Government taking steps to introduce a stronger registration scheme? Again, the Bill disproves that argument. If the bureaucracy is common to registration and licensing schemes, as is stated in the consultation paper, there is no justification—if the arguments are valid—for part II of the Bill. As far as I know, the Government do not intend to withdraw part II, although they have already surprised us by withdrawing 11 clauses. They accept that part II involves bureaucracy, so they cannot use that as an argument against a licensing scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument that only the better landlords would agree to register and that the worst would refuse to come forward so that there would be no significant improvement in standards does not wash. The Minister obviously does not believe that. On Second Reading he clearly and unequivocally argued for an effective scheme that would tackle the worst conditions. He believes that his proposals are the best way to achieve that, and we believe that a licensing scheme is the right
	<span class='label label-info column'>200</span>
way to achieve it, but neither of us doubt that tough and effective action is required to improve standards, which will result from action to tackle the worst problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Local authorities must have clear and enforceable rules on safety. They must be able to say 'enough is enough' when it comes to approving new establishments and closing those which are not managed effectively and responsibly. It is stated on the face of the Bill that the registration and control scheme can be refused if the owner is not a fit person to manage the establishments."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 29 January 1966; Vol. 270, c. 744.]</p></blockquote>
So clearly the Minister does not believe the argument that a licensing scheme will not tackle the problem—that it will not lead to action on the worst properties in the worst condition and that only the good landlord will come forward—because his registration scheme is designed to tackle the worst problems, and he accepts that there is a case for doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So of the three arguments advanced against the national licensing scheme in the Government's consultation paper, two do not stand up. The Government are bringing forward their own proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Multiple consultation appears to be going on in the Room. We ought to listen to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. I was saying that in their proposals the Government have effectively dismissed the objections to a national licensing scheme. That brings me to the third argument—here we enter significant territory—which is that it would introduce too high a degree of regulation into a market in which landlord and tenant are willing to agree on what is a "reasonable standard of accommodation".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us for the moment leave aside the question of reasonable standards of accommodation. The Committee will recall that earlier I highlighted the fact that a very high proportion of properties in the sector are unfit for human habitation and have a serious fire risk—a disproportionate risk of death or serious injury from fire, carbon monoxide poisoning and other hazards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leaving that question aside, will the scheme introduce too high a degree of regulation? The Government are clearly divided on the issue. The consultation paper was published in England in November 1994 and argued the case for licensing—although it put the case against as well. But in Wales, no consultation paper was issued. I am pleased to see that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales is present this morning. Perhaps he can explain why the Welsh Office took a different view from that of the Department of the Environment on the need for consultation about licensing houses in multiple occupation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rumours—they may be no more than that—attribute that to the then Secretary of State for Wales, the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), because of his view that he would make a better job of being Prime Minister than the current incumbent, is no longer a member of the Government. It is rumoured that when
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0120">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>201</span>
Secretary of State for Wales he vetoed the proposal that there should be consultation on a licensing scheme for houses in multiple occupation because he was opposed to regulation. There we approach the nub of the issue. Is an ideological hostility to regulation the reason why the Government—who recognise the problems, the poor conditions, threat to life and horror in some of our seaside resorts—are not prepared to introduce a national licensing scheme to tackle those problems?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The then Secretary of State for Wales appears to have made up his mind in advance and was not prepared to countenance that prospect. At least his English counterparts were prepared to consult—although, sadly, they did not listen very carefully to the responses. Three quarters of the respondents said clearly and unambiguously that we need to introduce a national, mandatory licensing scheme—76 per cent. of respondents were in favour. Housing authorities will be responsible for doing the work and have the clearest overview of housing conditions in their areas; 92 per cent. of them were in favour of a national licensing scheme. Those are persuasive majorities—but, as we shall see when we discuss parts VI and VII, the Government do not always listen to persuasive majorities. The majority in favour of dropping the homelessness proposals was even greater, but the Government have disregarded it.

The only groups opposed to a national licensing scheme for HMOs were landlords and fire authorities. Why? Fire authorities opposed the scheme on a technical issue. They wanted to retain responsibility for fire licensing rather than let it go to a local authority. That is an entirely understandable but separate issue. They did not dispute the need for effective action on fire; it was simply a matter of how best to do it. The only group opposed in principle to a national licensing scheme for HMOs were landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Landlords, by the Government's own admission, are in many cases running unsafe, squalid, dirty, disgusting and dangerous properties. Rather than recognising the need to maintain responsibility to ensure proper standards, the Government are putting themselves in a profoundly dangerous position. In backing slum landlords against the overwhelming majority of informed opinion, the Government have revealed a great deal about their priorities. They have also chosen to ignore the clear evidence of local authorities of all political persuasions who have real practical experience of what is involved. I shall quote from the response of some of those local authorities because it is important that members of the Committee are aware of the strength of feeling across the political divide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The housing Minister is a Yorkshire Member so I shall start with Beverley borough council, although it is in a different part of Yorkshire. The borough environmental health manager wrote to the Department of the Environment saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is my view that the introduction of a licensing system for HMOs will resolve many of the enforcement difficulties and place the burden of complying with current standards on the owners in order to have premises licensed. Whilst the detailed provisions of such a scheme will require careful consideration I would welcome its introduction and regard such a scheme as essential in order to enable
	<span class='label label-info column'>202</span>
authorities to improve the standards of such properties and reduce the bureaucracy of the current enforcement regime."</p></blockquote>
That means streamlining, simplifying and making it easier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to Harrogate borough council—we are getting nearer to the Minister. I said that the local authorities to which I would refer were of all different political opinions. Conservative Members have a treat in store. Not many local authorities are Tory-controlled but I tried very hard to get the views of a proper cross-representative sample of political differences among local authorities. To return to Harrogate—the Liberal Democrats must have their hour. The council states that its current powers
	<br><blockquote><p>"are extremely cumbersome, bureaucratic and confusing for landlords … Licensing would raise the profile of legislative requirements on a national scale. Harrogate borough council currently has a resource problem and currently operates a ten year plan for visiting each of its HMOs … If licensing was introduced, the scheme would allow some information about HMOs to be obtained to enable crude risk assessment to be completed prior to visiting"—</p></blockquote>
in other words, getting the priorities right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Sykes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Scarborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is my first intervention so far. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman will be interested in the response of Scarborough borough council in my constituency, which is Labour controlled. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] Opposition Members may have cause to regret saying that. A letter from the director of environmental health and housing services states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The proposed Special Control Provisions to regulate those HMOs which by virtue of poor management have an adverse effect on the neighbourhood in which they are situated, accord with controls in this area which the Borough Council has been seeking and which you have successfully pursued."</p></blockquote>
That is the view of a Labour council and I believe that that is the real voice of local authorities in the country. Is not what the hon. Gentleman is saying a case of new Labour but the old tricks of mandatory schemes left, right and centre?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary, the hon. Gentleman is referring to a later amendment. We are discussing a national licensing scheme. On Second Reading, the hon. Gentleman commended the views of his own authority and argued for tougher provisions than those provided by the Bill. I am arguing for a national licensing scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To get back to Harrogate—its response continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>'This local authority believes that there is a need for licensing as the progress in dealing with HMOs is currently very slow and the majority of tenants are living in substandard conditions (93 per cent. of Harrogate's 1290 HMOs)."</p></blockquote>
That authority—in Yorkshire—is keen for a national licensing scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration (Mr. David Curry)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is seeking to draw two extremes and to paint the Government's position as one of them. That is a travesty. There are only two substantial differences between the two sides of the Committee. The first is whether the scheme should be mandatory, or whether
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0121">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>203</span>
local authorities should be able to opt into it. Authorities have written stating how urgent the problem is, and it would be inexplicable if they did not opt into the scheme. The second issue is the definition of the categories of HMOs that fall within the scheme. We believe that a certain level should be excluded, but the hon. Gentleman's later amendments will attempt to broaden the range caught by the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With respect to the powers and the effective action that a local authority can take, there is precious little difference between the registration scheme that we suggest, and the licensing scheme that the hon. Gentleman suggests. I hope, therefore, that he will not persist in the argument that we favour a scheme that is much more lax. If local authorities mean what they say and what they have written, they will opt into the scheme and they will have the necessary powers—in some case, more than they may have envisaged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will recall that I said that there was no difference between the two sides of the Committee on the need for action; the difference was over the way in which we proposed to tackle the problem. I do not accept all his points. There are other matters on which we want changes and improvements in the Government's proposals, other than the issue of whether the scheme should be mandatory or discretionary, and the definition of HMOs. We shall deal with those when we discuss later amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the principle—and I accepted it, entirely properly, in my opening remarks—that we both recognise that there is a problem, and that we are arguing about the best way of resolving it. The Government consulted on the matter and set out both arguments in their consultation paper. I fairly and properly quoted both sides of the argument, and I am giving hon. Ministers the benefit of the views of a range of different local authorities responding to that consultation and all advocating a national mandatory licensing scheme. We share the views of those authorities. We think that they are right, and the Minister will have to explain why, despite their views in response to the consultation and the overwhelming support—76 per cent. of the respondents—he has not decided to go down that route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The royal borough of Kensington and Chelsea
	<br><blockquote><p>"fully supports the introduction of a national, mandatory, scheme for the licensing of HMOs."</p></blockquote>
I am sorry that I did not manage to get a response from the London borough of City of Westminster for the right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South (Mr. Brooke). I have not been able to bring Westminster into the debate, but I hope that the neighbouring borough of Kensington and Chelsea gives him some comfort. That borough is quite clear that it is
	<br><blockquote><p>"necessary to ensure that conditions in HMOs are improved uniformly and nationally under properly constituted risk assessment scheme … [and] ensure that both owners and tenants are aware of the requisite standards"</p></blockquote>
to ensure that
	<br><blockquote><p>"inconsistencies are avoided and the profile of HMOs raised.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Licensing would assist landlords, particularly those with portfolios, who would be secure in the knowledge that the standards they need to comply with were uniform and applied nationwide. By encouraging responsible landlords to remain in the private rented
	<span class='label label-info column'>204</span>
sector, the image of private renting would be enhanced and made more attractive."</p></blockquote>
There is not a word in that statement with which I disagree. The royal borough of Kensington and Chelsea has hit the nail on the head on every point. I only regret that the Minister has not chosen to follow its point of view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does the hon. Gentleman think the royal borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Harrogate or Beverley could do under a national licensing scheme that it cannot do by opting into the registration scheme, if we agree that it is necessary to define the properties that would come into the scheme? Once that question is solved, what is the difference for local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give the Minister the most immediate and obvious answer. The passage that I quoted made the case for a good quality private rented sector that will encourage landlords to remain in the sector and to maintain high standards. Any local authority that wants to impose a proper and rigorous scheme will be worried about the prospect of unscrupulous landlords moving out of the areas, closing down their properties and renting elsewhere, offering substandard accommodation in another area. That would undermine the viability of the private rented sector and allow slum conditions to exist elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Conservative Members look at the evidence, they will see that far to many landlords let slum-condition properties with impunity because many authorities do not properly enforce standards. I shall deal with that evidence in a moment. Conservative Members will have the pleasure of hearing evidence from the Audit Commission—an exemplary body in the assessment of local authority performance—which shows that the local authority performance varies enormously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just want to clarify the hon. Gentleman's case, which is that some local authorities are so bad, indifferent or whatever that they permit HMOs to continue to exist without the necessary controls. That clarifies the difference between mandatory and opt in schemes. We should trust local authorities to know what is best for their areas, but the hon. Gentleman wants a universal system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall resist the temptation to go into a lengthy debate about the city of Westminster, but the performance of authorities varies. Evidence from the Audit Commission shows that there are unacceptable variations in the way in which local authorities administer their powers. One of the arguments for a national mandatory scheme is that it would ensure consistent standards throughout the country, which would be good not just for tenants, but for landlords because they would know what standards they were required to meet. They could not concentrate their efforts in areas where the regulatory regime was lax, where they could get away with worse conditions and less investment in improvements than in the good areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The precise purpose of introducing the model control scheme—of which the hon. Gentleman will be aware—under which local authorities can proceed to implement the legislation without reference to the Secretary of State, is to achieve a standard of performance across the country which is as even as it can be given local circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have no objection to a model scheme. There should be a mandatory model scheme which must be complied throughout the country, rather than a model scheme with which good authorities only would apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend consider that, in the Minister's line of argument, there is no difference between what authorities could do under the registration scheme that he proposes and what they would be asked to do under a mandatory scheme? The Government's primary argument against the licensing scheme—that it would be excessively bureaucratic—falls down because the Minister has said that both schemes would have the same administrative agreements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an extremely valid point, which we shall test later. I shall deal with other possible objections that the Government might put forward. I have dealt with the objections that they have set out in their consultation paper. I have demonstrated that hostility to regulation is the sole objection that has any validity or force with Conservative Members; the others do not stack up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government could have two other possible objections to the introduction of a national mandatory licensing scheme. First, such a scheme might be expensive and cumbersome. If the Government take that view, they should consider—to which I have referred—Geoffrey Randall's report on licensing private lettings for the Campaign for Bedsit Rights. In a detailed and thorough analysis of the various options, he concluded—it is a persuasive case—that a self-financing scheme limited to HMOs, not extended more widely to private lettings, could be introduced on the basis of a licensing fee of just £30 per room. That is not an onerous sum, especially given the sums paid for each of those rooms from housing benefit. Many hon. Members will be only too well aware that sometimes more than £100 a week goes into landords' pockets, via tenants in such properties, from housing benefit. Against that background, £30 is hardly an onerous charge. The Government propose to give the Secretary of State power to specify a maximum registration fee. I invite the Minister to say whether he regards £30 as unreasonably high.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is probably too low.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a sedentary intervention, the Minister suggests that £30 is too low.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First we will consult about what is a sensible level. It is important that local authorities receive from registration the funds that they need for the work that they must undertake. I question whether a level of £30 would necessarily deliver sufficient money
	<span class='label label-info column'>206</span>
to local authorities. The level of £30 is proposed as an annual fee; we recommend that a fee be set for a much longer period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister recognises, we differ about the period that there should be between licensing and relicensing. That is one of the other differences that I referred to earlier, and to which we shall return. The licence fee of £30 was proposed in the report produced for the Campaign for Bedsit Rights by Geoffrey Randall. If the Minister regarded that amount as excessive—clearly, he does not—it would be difficult to operate the registration scheme that he proposes. But in fact he suggests that the amount is too small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I hope that cost will not be advanced as an argument against a national licensing scheme. Such a scheme should be self-financing; the charge on landlords should be simply that which is necessary to cover the local authorities' costs incurred in carrying out the work; there should be no element of profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second argument that might be advanced against a national licensing scheme is that it is unnecessary; that the discretionary local registration scheme that the Government propose will be sufficient. I suspect that the nub of the Minister's argument will be that he will give local authorities streamlined powers to register, that that is sufficient and that there is no need for a national scheme. That argument is not compelling. In the report to which I have already referred, Geoffrey Randall spells out in detail the evidence from the Audit Commission of the current variation in the performance of local authorities. The report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The effectiveness of local authority programmes to remedy bad conditions in the private rented sector was examined by the Audit Commission in 1989–90. They found that in that year local authorities had served statutory notices on only 5 per cent. of HMOs requiring attention. There was a fourfold variation in the number of statutory enforcement actions taken, per officer per year, between the best performing and worst performing 25 per cent. of authorities. If all authorities had performed at the level of the best 25 per cent., then the numbers of properties improved could be increased by about 75 per cent."</p></blockquote>
That is fairly devastating evidence of the current variation in the performance of local authorities. The Minister will have to make a persuasive case why local authorities should continue to be free to maintain such a variation in standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not deny that local authorities' standards differ widely, but they do so right across the range of statutory functions—that is what the Audit Commission discovers in almost every report. The fact that something is made incumbent upon local authority—mandatory—will not by itself make the situation any better than it was the day before it became mandatory. The Audit Commission's findings show that to be true across the board. The hon. Gentleman is pursuing a red herring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be arguing for a scheme that will allow local authorities the discretion to decide whether they introduce a registration scheme. That will allow those authorities that are failing to meet the needs of the people of their areas to continue to do so. A national framework will not be created to enable close monitoring to be undertaken to show the performance of different authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0123">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>207</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sykes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely if the hon. Gentleman's argument held any water it would be up to local electors in such areas to vote in a Conservative administration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows only too well, electors in many areas of the country—including his own—have had the good sense to return Labour councils. On Second Reading, the hon. Gentleman commended the actions of the Labour authority in Scarborough. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I commend the actions of Scarborough borough council"—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 29 January 1996, Vol. 270; c. 697.]</p></blockquote>
—a good Labour authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's discretionary scheme will not tackle the worst problems. It will allow authorities that are not diligent or doing their job properly to go on failing their residents and their areas; it will allow continuing anomalies and different standards in different areas, all of which will be bad for tenants and bad for landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Landlords will have to meet different standards in different areas. Many hold properties across several local authority areas and will not understand why they are required to do certain things in some areas, but not in others. It will be a highly confusing and uncertain picture for them. What happens if an authority that operates a registration scheme decides to drop it, or if an authority that has not been operating one decides to suddenly introduce one? For no apparent reason, other than a political decision by a local authority, a landlord could be required to meet new conditions and standards or he may no longer be required to carry out expensive schemes on which he has spent a lot of money. It is a recipe for confusion and it is bad for landlords and tenants. It will not be easy to persuade anyone of the merits of the Government's proposals. Ministers will have a hard task convincing not just the Committee but people outside that their proposals are right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the special issue of seaside areas, where hotels have been converted into bed-sitting rooms that are let to people on benefits and where there are concentrations of very serious problems. Many hon. Members referred to that on Second Reading, including the hon. Members for Scarborough (Mr. Sykes) and for Blackpool, North (Mr. Elletson). They spoke in sensible and admirable terms about the problems and the need to take action. The hon. Member for Scarborough said:
	<br><blockquote><p>'The most unbearable manifestation is the badly run DSS hostel, usually owned or managed by unscrupulous landlords. They are the real fat cats, with their noses firmly in the housing benefit trough. They are the landlords who cram unfortunate tenants like sardines into their hotels. They are the landlords whom I want to drive into the sea and out of business for ever. The badly run DSS hostels can be small former guest houses with five or six tenants, or they can be large former hotels with up to 100 tenants. The effect of just one badly run DSS hostel can be devastating in a town such as Scarborough.—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 29 January 1996; Vol. 270, c. 698.]</p></blockquote>
I agree entirely. Scarborough is a town which I like and which I have visited frequently, and it is unfortunate that the wrong hotel fell into the sea a few years ago. The hon. Gentleman expressed his constituents' concerns extremely well. The situation is a disgrace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Blackpool, North also stressed the issue and said:
	<span class='label label-info column'>208</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"How can we deal with that problem? The Government have gone some way in the Bill towards addressing the issue of a registration scheme, but I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Atkinson) that the Bill does not go far enough. I was delighted to hear what my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State had to say about the scale of the powers that he appears to be ready to offer to local authorities to enable them to close down places that are having a significantly deleterious effect on the local community. I believe that the best way of ensuring that that happens is through a proper licensing scheme—possibly self-financing—that allows local authorities to opt in. In any event, we need a licensing scheme. I hope that when the Government table their amendments to the Bill, we shall see the introduction of such a scheme".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 29 January 1996; Vol. 270, c. 713.]</p></blockquote>
I agree with the views of both those hon. Members and all the others who have argued for a national licensing scheme. Our case is overwhelming. It is based on the human lives that are at risk. We are concerned about the well-being of tenants who often live in squalid and disgusting conditions. We want to raise standards generally in the private rented sector. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee want to raise standards. The only difference between us is that we believe that national standards should be set, so that there is clarity for landlords, safety and security for tenants, and pressure on local authorities in every area to deliver a proper regulatory framework applying to all HMOs where the risks are most heavily concentrated. We believe that such a scheme is essential and that the 29 members of the Committee have a responsibility to set aside all other considerations, including party-political ones. They must recognise the responsibility to set in place a framework that stops the appalling toll of lives lost through fire and other safety hazards and to improve the squalid conditions from which too many of our fellow citizens have to suffer. I hope that the Committee will support us in seeking the introduction of a national, mandatory licensing scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Gwilym Jones)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by acknowledging two points made by the hon. Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford). First, we all appreciated his saying that he would not explain every amendment in the massive group, and we all appreciate the way in which he and his colleagues—indeed, the whole Committee—have been trying to make progress on the Bill. However, a little more study of each amendment might have been helpful to our understanding of the concept of mandatory, to which I shall return. Secondly, I agree with the hon. Gentleman that there is no difference between the Government and the Opposition on the existence of the problem and the need to take action. I shall develop that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that there had been no consultation and no wish to consult or do anything about the problem in Wales. That is not the case. Even though there was no consultation paper when my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) was Secretary of State for Wales, my right hon. Friend and I were no less concerned about the need to take action and to consult properly. If anything, there was more effective consultation in Wales than there was elsewhere. My right hon.

My officials also met student groups, university accommodation officers, councils, landlords and tourism groups to discuss in much more detail all the practical issues relating to those homes.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall share with the Committee the fact that the range of responses that we received were similar to those mentioned by the hon.

The hon. Member for Greenwich has made much of the need to be persuasive in the debate, but I put it to him that he has failed to be persuasive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Burden 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Northfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon.

What was the difference between those letters and the consultation papers issued in England?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that no one is any doubt, I am happy to send every member of the Committee exactly what my right hon.

The letter was designed to pursue the matter in parallel with the consultation exercise carried out by my colleagues at the Department of the Environment. We wanted to elicit what those representatives felt about such an important matter. We come to same conclusion and the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Greenwich presented it in introducing the debate, the issue is licensing versus registration, but as his arguments ran, I hoped that the debate would not be solely about semantics—about whether one called the arrangements licensing or registration. It must be about more than that. There are questions to be answered—for example, what are the powers involved? The hon. Gentleman did not seem to advance any claim that the powers that would be available to local authorities should be strengthened further than we proposed. That must be an important aspect for us to examine. Are the powers adequate? Should they be made stronger?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister conducted a consultation exercise on the powers contained in the Bill. Although respondents said that they would prefer to use the term "licensing", the extent of the powers was generally welcomed. That line has been followed in the debate. So far the Opposition have not called for additional powers or further strengthening of the powers, in addition to the strengthening that we propose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Harold Elletson (Blackpool, North): It is clear that, to most of my hon. Friends the Government's proposals in the Bill, which we debated on Second Reading, do not go as far as many of us would have liked, but what the Government are now proposing, especially in the new clause 7, would give us a licensing scheme in all but name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my hon. Friend confirm that the views that I expressed on Second Reading were significantly misrepresented by the hon. Member for Greenwich? I called for a

any local authority to refuse to implement the scheme or protect the tenants of HMOs in its area who could be exposed to bad landlords. That is not a matter of semantics. We must protect every tenant of such properties throughout the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman accurately anticipates the next point in the argument. It is a question of compulsion—whether the Government know best. That is what the hon. Member for Greenwich is advocating, but the argument sits less well the further one is from London. Circularity is implicit in it: much of the case for the need for action is based on evidence and responses to consultation from local authorities but as my hon. Friend the Minister pointed out to the hon. Gentleman, doubts are then expressed about whether we can be confident that they will act in response to the problems that they played a leading part in identifying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will recall that the Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration said earlier, in an intervention, that the Government proposed to introduce a model scheme.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends at what level one takes the argument. The hon. Gentleman highlights an essential difference between Government and Opposition members of the Committee. Conservative Members, especially in relation to Wales, use the phrase "practising real devolution". We try to take decisions at the lowest possible level and give more opportunities to local authorities. The hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends have a centralising tendency; they want to impose control from the top. It emerged as a result of the Minister's interventions that the hon. Gentleman really wants to tackle rogue councils, although he gently described them as authorities that are not diligent and are not doing their job properly. He did not explain the difference that a mandatory scheme would make between the day before and the day after it was implemented. The hon. Gentleman is trying to introduce the concept of rogue councils, but who would police them? It is one thing to have a duty and to have mandatory powers, but how would they be enforced in the rogue councils? Who will ensure that they do as the hon. Gentleman anticipates when he is sitting in Marsham Street controlling them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Does the Minister accept that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon.

Further scrutiny of all the amendments reveals that they are woolly, they would not achieve their aim. If they were accepted, the first part of clause 62 would state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every local authority may make a licensing scheme".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister must not criticise the Chair's selection of amendments. The point that he makes is a different argument from that behind amendment No. 211, and is the basis of the group of amendments led by amendment No. 212. That may assist the Minister; I was worried that he was in danger of developing that argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rush to reassure you, Mr. McWilliam, that I do not intend to criticise the Chair, but the amendments before us now have the effect of changing the part of clause 62 that I quoted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities have for a long time had significant powers to intervene in this sector to improve standards. They have at their disposal a range of statutory and discretionary duties to take action when those standards are not met. They can already establish HMO registration schemes containing control provisions under which registration can be refused for new HMOs being established in their area if management or other conditions are unsatisfactory. They also have a statutory duty to ensure adequate means of escape in the largest HMOs, those exceeding 500 square metres of floor space and those exceeding two storeys in height.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposals give the existing powers much stronger teeth. Local authorities will be able to refuse registration of an HMO on initial application if the property is below standard or the management is inadequate. They will also be able to deregister property if conditions within the property or management standards begin to deteriorate. If the local authority decides to take action against an existing HMO, it will have a wide variety of powers available to it. It will be able to demand improvements to the property. If those improvements are not carried out, it will be able to carry out the work in default. If it decides to deregister a property, it will have powers to require the owner to run down the property in an orderly manner. By that, I mean that existing tenants will be able to remain, but the owner will not be able to fill vacancies as they occur.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Greenwich said that only good landlords would come forward. When pressed by my hon. Friend the Minister of State he said that the amendments were really intended to tackle rogue councils. I accept that mere could be difficulties in finding and tackling slum landlords, but why would licensing help? Local authorities would still be faced with the same problems. We are increasing the level of fines for non-compliance with registration schemes and we are placing a duty on landlords to improve their properties when necessary. If they do not, that will be a criminal offence and they could be liable to civil proceedings, too. Such measures will help to secure better compliance under registration. However, the hon. Gentleman has not demonstrated any way in which his concept of licensing would make an improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0126">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>213</span>
We have also provided several measures under which local authorities will be able, through stronger enforcement activity, to generate the resources needed for that work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the Minister missing the point again? He has referred to the powers that are available to local authorities. We are arguing through the amendments whether all local authorities throughout the country should have to use the powers to safeguard tenants in the properties or whether they can opt out and leave the tenants exposed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My argument is how would a mandatory licensing scheme make a difference to the efficiency of those powers? The Opposition are not responding to that point. There is no difference between us about the powers and the need for such powers, but the Opposition are not saying why a mandatory licencing scheme would make a difference to the way in which councils—be they rogue councils or others—implement them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall be increasing fees payable by the landlord on initial registration and for re-registration after five years. We shall also allow charges to be made for the costs incurred by the authority in serving formal enforcement notices under section 352 of the 1985 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should the scheme be self-financing? There is much scope for arguing about what is meant by a self-financing scheme. We are not claiming that our registration proposals would necessarily be self-financing. However, they will provide local authorities with much-needed finance. We are proposing to charge for enforcement notices. That is generally welcomed and we shall consult carefully about the level of fees that will be charged, so that landlords will not be discouraged from letting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposals also provide a new model registration scheme to be issued by the Secretary of State. If a local authority follows that, it will not need to apply for individual approval for any scheme that it wants to make. In addition to the stronger powers relating to registration, we are proposing to take tougher action to deal with the threat of fire in high-risk HMOs. I am sure that such action will be supported by all members of the Committee. We propose to do that by making a new statutory instrument under the powers contained in section 365 of the Housing Act 1985, which will be amended by clause 70 of the Bill. That will widen the existing statutory duty of local authorities to inspect and check for adequate fire safety measures in high-risk HMOs. That duty will be extended to all HMOs that are potentially registrable, but which are also two storeys or more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our package includes in clause 69 a new duty on landlords to keep their properties up to standard. Breach of that duty will be a criminal offence and the penalties for other HMO offences will be increased.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Under-Secretary explain the logic of restricting the new powers to HMOs of three or more storeys? What evidence does he have of the extent of fires in properties of that size as opposed to those of two storeys or less?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>214</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are continuing the existing concept, which is in line with what the hon. Gentleman said earlier. All local authorities need to address the general and specific problems of HMOs, and deal with the worst cases. There must be a priority of risk assessment. We are proposing the same principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason for the earlier question was that there is substantial evidence, to which we shall allude in subsequent debates, of the extensive risk in smaller HMOs. For example, the London borough of Brent, another Conservative-controlled authority, highlighted the extent to which fires occur in two-storey terraced and semi-detached properties. The Under-secretary would exempt those properties. What is the basis for that exemption?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said a moment ago, we are proceeding on the principle outlined by the hon. Gentleman—that one should seek to have an appropriate approach to priorities. We are going forward on what we believe to be the appropriate position. Of course, I welcome the opportunity to debate the matter further with the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 71 provides for the Secretary of State to approve codes of practice. We envisage that power being used to bring forward a clear code of practice that will guide local authority enforcement procedures and will clarify the standards required of HMO landlords. The amendments call for a code of practice covering standards and management conditions for the model licensing scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, the amendments illustrate a fixation with a licensing system that adds nothing to our proposals except bureaucracy and over-centralisation. Amendment No. 179 would make it a criminal offence to contravene the proposed code of standards in relation to the licensing scheme. The difficulty with that is that the code would need to be drafted with absolute precision, dealing with every case and all possible defences. That would be difficult, if not impossible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have taken a different and better course. Our code of practice would be evidential in legal terms; it can therefore be expressed in more general terms, and landlords will be able to depart from it if they can demonstrate good cause or if they have substituted an alternative method to achieve the same results. It can be suggested that licensing linked to a code of practice affords the opportunity for a simplified codification of legislation relating to HMOs, which includes at least 17 Acts of Parliament. I admit that that is a difficult and complex area of housing and that there is always scope to simplify administrative procedures. Some of our proposals have that aim. The national code of practice and the model registration schemes are two examples. However, nothing in the Opposition's licensing proposals would achieve anything more than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition suggest that registration should be replaced with licensing. They also want a code of practice, yet all the other legislation relating to HMOs will remain. I see no simplification in that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>215</span>
landlords who had to be licensed under a mandatory national scheme would than have the power to argue their case? Many tenants are too old, too frail or too frightened to attempt that. The Under-Secretary has said much about local authorities and even more about landlords, but the tenants have not once been mentioned. I believe that they should be vital to our considerations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady seems to be taking the same position as the hon. Member for Greenwich. They seem to be concerned about rogue councils. We are impressed by the local authorities' responses to consultation, and by their knowledge of the situation. The difference is that the Government trust the councils to a far greater degree. What is the logic of saying that councils that come forward should not be expected to take the opportunity to use the powers given under the Bill—powers that have been generally welcomed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not concerned with rogue councils. Surely the Under-Secretary understands that some landlords will move from a local authority's remit because it is concerned to impose the regulations—such as they are—that protect tenants of houses in multiple occupation, to a local authority where such restraints and restrictions are not imposed. If those restraints and restrictions are not nationally mandatory, rogue and unscrupulous landlords will move from one area to another. Their basic concern is not the health and welfare of their tenants or their properties, but making a great deal of money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The conclusion of the hon. Lady's argument would be that such rogue landlords could only move to another area if there were a rogue council that neglected its duties. As I asked the hon. Member for Greenwich, what is the difference between the day before and the day after a mandatory scheme is introduced? How can the man in Marsham street—who knows best, according to the hon. Member for Greenwich—ensure that rogue councils are policed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposals represent the appropriate strengthening of local authority powers. They are the appropriate response. Local authorities will respond, take the opportunity—which they welcomed—represented by our proposals and put them into effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am becoming a little worried about what the Under-Secretary is saying about his Department's ability to police the scheme. If he has so little confidence in its ability to police a mandatory licensing scheme, how does he think they can police the model scheme that he is urging the Committee to accept?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Greenwich must be asked that question, as he proposed the idea that having a mandatory licensing system somehow makes a difference. He has not demonstrated how it will make a difference; nor has he said how it would be policed if it did not make a difference. We will agree on the extent of the problem and on the powers that must be available, which are those that the Bill provides. Local authorities will respond. I commend our proposals to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>216</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was enormously disappointed with what the Under-Secretary said because he did not address either the real problems to which my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich referred or the proposals in the amendments. The Government accept as a premise that houses in multiple occupation are different and require different treatment. There is no argument about that in Committee. The Under-Secretary went to great lengths to say that the Government recognise the fact that there are insufficient powers to deal with those landlords who do not run HMOs properly, causing risk to tenants. He gave severall examples of how he thought the Bill would improve those powers, enabling local authorities to control such landlords. In later debates, we shall consider whether those powers improve or reduce the ability of local authorities to act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary said that the current arrangements are unsatisfactory which is why the Government intend to legislate, but he said nothing to reassure us about the fact that the Government seem content that there might be no scheme in place in certain parts of the country. There will be areas of the country where tenants in houses in multiple occupation have no protection because, whatever powers are in the Bill, there will be no scheme through which they can be exercised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary often referred to rogue councils. I understand that there are currently fewer than 100 effective schemes for registering and dealing with houses in multiple occupation. Many of those schemes involve little more than registration; there is no active back up from the local authority, but simply a requirement for landlords of such properties to notify the local authority of the property's existence. That is all that is required of landlords in some parts of the country, which is our concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a question of rogue councils or rogue landlords. There are rogue landlords and there might be councils that do not use the powers properly, but our concern is about the tenants of such properties whose lives are being put at risk and about how we, as Members of Parliament, should act to try to protect them. If we believe that there is a risk—presumably, we believe that, there is otherwise we would not be treating such properties differently—have not we a responsibility to ensure that the protection applies to all tenants in such properties without exception? That is the basic difference between the Government and the Opposition on this matter, and it is one of absolute principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that houses in multiple occupation are different because of the dangers that they pose to people who live in them. Of course, some landlords run HMOs admirably and properly, and some local authorities police landlords effectively, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich said, the evidence shows that people living in HMOs are 28 times more likely to die or to be seriously injured in a fire than people living in other rented properties. That is surely a matter of the most enormous concern and if it does not make Conservative Members want to ensure that every one of those properties and every one of those tenants is protected, according to the powers that they want to be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0128">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>217</span>
enacted in the Bill, they must seriously ask themselves why not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also know that, according to the Government's house conditions survey, two fifths of those properties are unfit—twice as many as ordinary private rented properties. HMOs are substantially different from other rented properties in degree of unfitness and fire risk, so we need different powers to deal with landlords and conditions and we should apply those powers to all such properties. That is why we are arguing for a mandatory scheme rather than an optional scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the beginning of the consultation, the Government said that they were open-minded about a mandatory licensing scheme. The then Minister, the right hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) went to great lengths to say that the Government had not made up their mind. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I share the widespread concern about the poor conditions and fire risks in some houses in multiple occupation."</p></blockquote>
We could all agree on that. He went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, I have an open mind about whether licensing of all HMOs is the most effective way forward."</p></blockquote>
He had an open mind. The consultation then took place and 76 per cent. of respondents said that they wanted a mandatory national licensing scheme. If the Minister's mind had been genuinely open, would not it have been likely to have been pushed in the direction of supporting a licensing scheme?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend for Greenwich said, many of the respondents who questioned the idea of the licensing scheme were worried not about the mandatory nature of the scheme but about where responsibility for fire protection should lie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the consultation paper linked to the White Paper "Our Future Homes", the Government set out their response to the consultation exercise and gave reasons why they had decided against a mandatory scheme. I did not hear one argument this morning arising from the consultation exercise that could possibly have persuaded any open-minded Government to go for a non-mandatory scheme. Can the Under-Secretary cite one response from one responsible representative body that pushed him and his colleagues in that direction?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the response document, the Government said that a licensing scheme
	<br><blockquote><p>"would lead to excessive cost and bureaucracy",</p></blockquote>
but this morning the Under-Secretary said clearly that if local authorities adopted the model registration scheme, tenants in HMOs would be in exactly the same position as if a national mandatory scheme were in force. It is interesting that the Government have come up with the idea of a model registration scheme, which suggests that they have a view about how housing should be run. The Under-Secretary challenged Opposition Members to say how the position of tenants under a model registration scheme would be different from that of tenants under a mandatory scheme. If there is no difference, how can the cost and bureaucracy be different? The Government's arguments fall at the first hurdle, shot down by ammunition provided by the former housing Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>218</span>
The Government went on to say that they were in favour of
	<br><blockquote><p>"a stronger local authority led programme to improve standards".</p></blockquote>
I am not sure what that means. Surely the strongest local authority-led programme would require local authorities to have a programme would require local authorities to have a programme of action through a mandatory licensing scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government also said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is an additional advantage that strengthening existing powers may enable change to be made more quickly, using secondary legislation in some cases."</p></blockquote>
However, the Committee is considering primary legislation, because the Government concluded that the best way to enforce the powers was through primary legislation, so it would be no quicker to introduce the registration scheme than it would be to introduce a mandatory scheme—either could be up and running in the same amount of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government had an overwhelming response in favour of a licensing scheme, not only from local authority associations but from the Institution of Environmental Health Officers, the Chartered Institute of Housing, Shelter, the Refugee Council, the National Union of Students, and the National Association of Probation Officers—all the representative bodies involved. The Government claim to have been open minded, but they decided against a mandatory scheme, despite the overwhelming response to the contrary. The Government's arguments against the mandatory scheme do not hold water—the housing Minister himself destroyed the central argument, which concerns cost and bureaucracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other argument that the Under-Secretary used was that it was strange that the Government should be in favour of giving local authorities the freedom to act whereas Opposition Members were arguing for a mandatory scheme. That is not strange at all. Opposition Members have always been prepared to argue for minimum standards and requirements that local authorities must adopt in the provision of services. We have accepted that principle in relation to many matters, such as education and health and hygiene—environmental health officers have to enforce such standards all the time. There are many areas in which legislation lays down national standards that local authority officers have to enforce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no argument to say that there should not be a mandatory scheme because the Government do not police local authority activities—the Government police local authority provision of all sorts of services. When they want to impose certain policies, they find mechanisms to police local authorities. There were no shortage of policing powers when the Government introduced the right-to-buy scheme; they checked up on every local authority. Local authorities had to fill in sheets galore, saying what action they were taking to ensure that the scheme worked effectively. The Government wanted that scheme to work, so they found a mechanism to ensure that local authorities were forced to put the scheme into practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government wanted to, they could ensure that a mandatory scheme for HMOs was put into practice. Their excuse is so feeble that it is not worth considering.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0129">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>219</span>
If they are saying that they are so ineffective that they could not make such a scheme work, they have no business to be in Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to correct the hon. Gentleman. I am not advocating the line that the hon. Gentleman suggests. I was questioning how the hon. Member for Greenwich would follow through the logic of the argument that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) is advancing. What policing of rogue councils would the hon. Member for Greenwich put in place? Is he suggesting that there should be an inspectorate similar to that on pollution or education? Are the Opposition suggesting mat all that work should be done in Marsham street?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there was a requirement in law, I should expect local authorities to follow it. The Department of the Environment would require local authorities to follow such a law, as they are required to follow other laws. For example, district auditors examine local authority expenditure. The Audit Commission has a wide range of responsibilities to ensure the proper provision of services, and regularly monitors local authorities. There are already bodies with responsibilities in local authority services, and I do not see why they should not be responsible for enforcing a licensing system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must decide whether protection for the tenants who live in HMOs is important. If it is important enough, we shall find a way to enforce it. That is the essence of our argument. As many of the responses to the consultation said, the current situation is unsatisfactory. Seventeen Acts of Parliament cover HMOs. The matter is confusing, and that different schemes operate throughout the country, especially in London where a different scheme can be operated on one wide of the street from the one that is operated on the other side of the street, is neither tolerable nor defensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be dealing with the rights of tenants to such protection and local authorities should be required to provide it. If Opposition Members and local government were arguing about the matter and local government said that it was another example of central Government interference, we might consider that. But local authorities are not saying that; they want a mandatory scheme. They want the Government to impose requirements on them because they believe that tenants should be protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authority associations of all political persuasions are arguing the case for a mandatory scheme. It is only the Government who are not. If they recognise the great risks to which people are put in some properties, they must explain why they think it reasonable for there to be no registration scheme in some local authority areas and for tenants to be given no protection. The Government must say why they are willing for such a situation to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are basically arguing about people's lives. I accept that I am becoming emotional about the matter, but people are killed regularly in such properties. The bottom line is that we want them to be protected and we want to reduce the number of deaths and accidents. The Committee should take seriously such responsibility.
	<span class='label label-info column'>220</span>
Are we prepared to vote for a situation in which tenants in such properties have no effective protection and, in the next 12 months or three years, will die as a result? If the Government consider that that situation is adequate, let them come out and argue for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members are not prepared to accept such a situation. Such tenants deserve protection and they have a right to look to their Members of Parliament to provide it. If that requires our saying to local authorities that they must have a mandatory scheme and enforce its standards, so be it. On this occasion, the local authorities are with us and I hope that we can persuade the Government to be with us, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Diana Maddock 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, the Government are out on a limb. Discussions and consultations have taken place with various groups that are involved in houses of multiple occupation as well as with tenants and local authorities that have HMOs in their areas. All the parties say, "We want to have a mandatory scheme". The Minister and the Under-secretary say that they want to give powers to local authorities. I agree, but why do they not listen to the local authorities that are saying, "We want a mandatory scheme"? That is one of the most powerful arguments for such a scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been argued that the scheme should not be mandatory because it could not be policed. What happens to other measures? It was amazing that the Under-Secretary said, "Well, we cannot make laws because we cannot police them". If we are serious about the scheme and if it is made mandatory, we can do something about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee will know that if local councillors failed to carry out their duties, they must pay certain penalties. If the Government are saying that, although the scheme will not be mandatory, everything will be fine, we do not agree with them. If the scheme is mandatory, councillors are far more likely to adhere to it. If they do not, penalties must be imposed and the councillors can be removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard about the unfit conditions of HMOs and the severe increase in the likelihood of death of those who live in such property.

If, as we shall discuss later, more people are to be housed in the private sector, many of them will be in HMOs—many homeless families with children, many vulnerable people and, because of other changes that are taking place, many young people, especially those under 25. The Government will try to ensure that those people are housed in the types of property that we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to bring to the attention of the Committee and the Minister two or three reports that outline the horrendous conditions in HMOs, especially for women, children and families. Those conditions are the reason why we all feel so strongly, and why there is agreement across all parties that we must do something about the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1993 a report entitled "Unhealthy housing: research, remedies and reform" was published. As part of the report, a study of 57 women was conducted of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0130">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>221</span>
London, Manchester and Southend bed-and-breakfast accommodation. Women's and children's health was badly affected by the poor hotel conditions. Particular problems related to pregnancy and poor nutrition: 28 per cent. of babies had a low birth weight, and colds, diarrhoea, vomiting and skin problems were common. Mothers and health professionals identified developmental and behavioural problems in children. Health visitors throughout the country would confirm those findings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another report that appeared in 1993 was called "Families in B&B: a survey of conditions and standards in two London boroughs". Health visitors carried out interviews with 33 families in 26 hotels in Hammersmith and Fulham and in Kensington and Chelsea. Many health and safety risks and failings were revealed. Fourteen out of 15 cots were found to be unsafe; 30 per cent. of families reported vermin in their rooms; 90 per cent. of families had no safe areas for children; and 75 per cent. of families had no instruction in fire procedures. Other dangers included a lack of electric socket covers and locks on windows. Such problems continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most disturbing recent reports—I attended its launch in 1995—was produced by the South Bank university, London, and is entitled "Out of sight: London's continuing B&B crisis". The figures suggest that local authorities are putting fewer people into bed-and-breakfast accommodation, but that is not the whole story. Local authorities, especially in London, are under great pressure because they have fewer properties at their disposal. When people present themselves as homeless, the local authorities make it more difficult for them to get through all the hoops and hurdles and to go through all the interviews. Many families in that position are finding life extremely difficult anyway, and the report reveals that an increasing number are referring themselves to HMOs. The local authorities do not know about them. That is a serious situation, which makes it important for us to get the Bill right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report estimated that between 10,000 and 15,000 households in London were self-placing, of which some 20 per cent, had children. It concluded that health and safety standards were deplorable. It found evidence of fire risks, poor kitchens, cockroaches and other infestations and, in many cases, staff were aggressive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those reports explain why we are keen to get matters right, and why many of us believe that if the private sector and HMOs are to play the role that the Government intend, there must be an effective framework to encourage long-term investment and good quality professional management. The consumers—the tenants—must be provided with safety, security and affordability. They do not want to live under the threat of homelessness, they need rights to repair and they need the protection of statutory enforcement. Landlords and investors also need a framework that regulates standards of accommodation and management that is predictable, stable and avoids needless bureaucracy. There is agreement across the board that we must ensure that councils act. For the reasons that I have mentioned, we need minimum
	<span class='label label-info column'>222</span>
standards. Responsible landlords and investors should be encouraged; we are trying to deal with those who are making a lot of money from the taxes that many of us pay out of providing substandard accommodation to the types of people whom we have been discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities need a clear and efficient legal framework to enforce standards, and to be able to make landlords responsible for tackling the extensive substandard conditions that exist in the sector. Above all, tenants of housing in multiple occupation must be given real guarantees that their homes will be made safe and healthy as soon as possible. That is why the Liberal Democrats, the Labour party and the majority of authorities want a mandatory scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Everyone in the Committee accepts that houses in multiple occupation have long been the subject of serious concern because of the high proportion of bad conditions and slum properties among HMOs. Tenants in HMOs are disproportionately at risk from fire and other safety hazards, such as defective gas appliances, as more than one member of the Committee has pointed out this morning. We must have regard for the health and safety of tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich explained that for sometime the Labour party has been campaigning for a national licensing scheme for HMOs. That is not a new proposal this morning; it has been campaigned for by the Labour party for many years in order to raise standards and ensure enforcement throughout the country. Some Conservative members of the Committee would go much further than we propose, but the Bill excludes HMOs that contain four bedsits or fewer. It has been pointed out that there is no logic behind that, as statistics show—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is anticipating amendments Nos. 217, 181 and 218; he should not do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The statistics show that in relation to registration we should consider the high number of people who have suffered as a result of faulty gas appliances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I pointed out, some Conservative members of the Committee would go much further than a national licensing scheme. On Second Reading, when we were discussing licensing, the hon. Member for Scarborough told us that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the trickle of complaints that I had been receiving turned into a torrent."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 29 January 1996; Vol. 270, c. 695.]</p></blockquote>
As a result, the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Blackpool, North made an extensive trawl of coastal towns. They consulted hoteliers associations, the police, and the housing, tourism and environment departments in nearly every single coastal resort. They spoke to the forces of law and order. They asked national tourist organisations what their experience had been. They questioned local hoteliers associations. They conferred with the Department of the Environment, the Department of National Heritage and the Department of Social Security. They consulted leisure companies whose interests lay with tourism. In other words, the two hon. Members undertook an extensive
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0131">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>223</span>
investigation. They did not ask about licensing or registration; they requested that a change in the user-client orders should be considered which would oblige hostels to apply for planning permission. The two hon. Members went on to state in the report that, in March 1994 they won the Prime Minister's backing for planning permission regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[MR. DAVID ASHBY 	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing in the Bill says that planning regulations will be part of registration. Yet members of the Committee presented a report that included the principle—with which the Prime Minister agreed—that people should obtain planning permission for such hostels in addition to registering them. That is much more bureaucratic than the registration scheme that the Prime Minister accepted. Therefore, the proposal that the Prime Minister considered was much wider than the Opposition's proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sykes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for giving way, as he has mentioned me and my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North. In fact, the Prime Minister said that he would consider removing the planning permission aspect when the licensing scheme had been considered and accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only quote what is on the record. On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Scarborough said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We also included in the report a request that consideration be given to changing the 'use class orders', to oblige hostels to apply for planning permission in future. In March 1994, we won the backing of the Prime Minister for planning permission regulations."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 29 January 1996; Vol. 270, c. 696.]</p></blockquote>
That did not imply that strings were attached or that, in other circumstances, the request for planning regulations would be withdrawn. Great play was made of the fact that the Prime Minister supported planning regulations. Local authorities will not be able to opt out if a law states that planning regulations must apply to houses in multiple occupation. Therefore, how can Conservative Members be in favour of presenting that proposal to the Prime Minister, but not in favour of accepting a national registration scheme which would introduce protection equal to that which the hon. Members for Scarborough and for Blackpool, North proposed after extensive investigation? So hon. Members are saying one thing and doing another, which is disgraceful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I was outside the Room when the hon. Gentleman mentioned me. The point that he raised about planning permission related to "use class orders", which we originally discussed two or three years ago. The Government changed the "use class orders" to make it much more difficult for hotels to become houses in multiple occupation. My hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and I fought and won that battle two years ago. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for drawing the public's attention to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We were told that the Prime Minister gave his backing to the proposal less than two years ago, in March 1994.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>224</span>
On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Scarborough said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In addition, the Prime Minister promised to look carefully at the case for the licensing of existing hostels."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 29 January 1996; Vol. 270, c. 696.]</p></blockquote>
Again, one assumes that if the Prime Minister is considering the matter he is not looking only at some houses or at allowing only certain houses in multiple occupation to be licensed. We think that the Prime Minister must be looking at it comprehensively and that it will apply across the board of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not only talking about coastal towns. The hon. Members for Scarborough and for Blackpool, North represent coastal towns and would want to obtain information on how their authorities were affected, but is there are regulations they must apply to all local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sykes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that our report was based entirely on a coastal survay of every Welsh and English seaside resort? That, and the drift of homeless people to the coast, was all that concerned us. We were not concerned with Leeds, Bradford or Glasgow because those are not where our problems are. Seaside resorts are specifically what the Prime Minister considered in dealing with this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is pleasing to note that the Prime Minister is considering sectors of the country and changes in planning laws and regulations on licensing of houses in multiple occupation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[MR. JOHN MCWILLIAM 	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will agree that the Bill applies not only to coastal resorts. I, for one, represent a county constituency and want the same protection for my constituents as do those who represent coastal towns. I want Yorkshire to have the same protection as the south of England, the centre of England and Wales, If the Government are looking only at certain areas, they should come clean and tell us so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Barnardos, in a circular on the Bill, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Bill permits local authorities who wish to set up HMO registration schemes. By not introducing a national, mandatory licesning system, families and young people will continue to be subjected to poor conditions, risk of accident and landlord harassment which are characteristics of the HMO sector."</p></blockquote>
Organisations that represent people right across the country are drawing attention to the fact that we cannot look only at seaside towns or other areas that might be favourable to the Conservative party. A policy has to be comprehensive. Our request this morning is for a national scheme that will be comprehensive and will give protection to the kind of people that Barnardos is concerned about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Local Government Information Unit has expressed similar concerns on how licensing should apply nationally as a mandatory function of local authorities. Local authorities should be strengthened to ensure that tenants of houses in multiple occupation will be protected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sykes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what he has said, will the hon. Gentleman congratulate the Labour-controlled
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0132">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>225</span>
Scarborough borough council on welcoming the Bill's provisions to tackle the problem that he is talking about?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the commendation of Scarborough borough council that the hon. Gentleman made on Second Reading. Labour took control of the council last May. In less than 12 months, backed by its Member of Parliament, it has shown, beyond a shadow of doubt, that it has people's interests at heart. That is good co-operation. We must give credit to the Labour Members of Scarborough council for taking the initiative in pursuing the matter, mindful of their responsibilites and duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other members of the Committee will have received a copy of the letter sent to my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Ms Anderson) from a solicitor in Blackpool. The letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Only a number of days ago I visited a property where a tenant had only moved into the same in January. The property was extremely cold, suffered from accute dampness and other matters. However what was quite apparent was there was a major problem with the gas fire. The gas board were called and they disconnected … If the room had not been so large the tenants may not have been here to revcount the story. The Landlord's response to all this is that … the tenants are only paying £100.000 per week".</p></blockquote>
In other words, because their rent is low, they must suffer appalling conditions. That heightens our concern that such landlords can avoid making premises habitable, as without a mandatory registration scheme, they will slip through the net. I ask the hon. Member for Blackpool, North to take heed of what is happening—perhaps not in his part of the borough—and of the appeals by tenants' representatives for a mandatory scheme that will give powers to local authorities to impose a duty on landlords to ensure that the conditions described by the solicitor from Blackpool do not persist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our case should persuade Conservative members of the Committee of the need for a statutory mandatory registration scheme. I appeal to hon. Members especially those to whom I referred, to support the amendments, which would help the tenants, not the owners, of substandard properties. We must take this opportunity to include the scheme in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In common with my hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock), I believe that an overriding concern is the danger of fire, faced every day by tenants in multiple-occupancy property. In 1994, in my constituency, there was a fired in a hostel for single men, whose rent was paid exclusively by housing benefit. At the time of the fire, which broke out in one of the rooms, there were 21 people living there. The resident of the room where the fire started died and the men in the rooms on either side suffered severely from smoke inhalation. It was impossible to open any of the windows in that hostel; the fire extinguishers had not been maintained and, in four instances, were empty. There were no fire alarms, and some escape routes and staircases were blocked. The local authority took the people who owned and managed the property to court; they were found guilty and fined. They had a string of previous convictions as long as may arm. They had begun operating houses of
	<span class='label label-info column'>226</span>
multiple occupation in the midlands, then moved to the south of England and to my constituency. I hope that the Minister appreciates that the fines imposed were but a drop in the ocean given the annual profits made by landlords of multiple-occupation houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Increasingly, in my constituency—and, I am sure, in every large urban conurbation—landlords are deliberately allowing multiple-occupation houses to decay. Many tenants in my constituency are elderly and frail, with little or no knowledge of their legal rights with regard to landlords. They certainly have no means of knowing how to obtain representation. It is not unusual for a tenant to be physically attacked by a landlord if the tenant has made representations to either the local authority or the police about the conditions in which they live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Slum properties are not cheap. Year on year, the owners-managers of such properties increase the rents. As I said, many tenants are elderly and live exclusively on pensions, so we, the taxpayers, via housing benefit are maintaining those landlords. The existing legislation for local authorities—even for one such as mine in Camden, which is particular about pursuing such landlords—is not sufficient. It is an extremely difficult process because often the landlords cannot be found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A mandatory national licensing scheme for multiple-occupation houses would be of enormous benefit and extremely advantageous to tenants. I cannot accept that such a scheme for HMOs would be impossible to police, as suggested by the Government. We have a national licensing scheme for television sets and for motor cars, so is it really beyond the wit of the House to have such a scheme for people's homes, which is a matter of primary importance?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other issue that the Government have failed to address is the desperate shortage of affordable housing. I can conceive of local authority, for the best of reasons, opting out of a non-mandatory scheme. It may worry, because of the housing shortage, that being in such a scheme would mean losing the multiple-occupation houses in its area, appalling, substandard and dangerous though they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be the Government's primary concern to concentrate on how to assist local authorities—I do not accept that they are rogue local authorities—to improve the housing stock in their areas. The Government must consider how to help them to ensure that standards of housing are raised. As my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich said, that would be a step towards helping everybody who wants standards to be increased. It is not acceptable that an elderly person in my constituency is in a property that has been allowed to deteriorate to such an extent that she walks around the wall area of her bed-sitting room because the middle of her room is so damp that the floor has rotted and decayed. Despite the notices served on her landlord by the local authority, nothing has been done. I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will endorse what is essentially a simple measure to alleviate the burden on frail, elderly and sometimes, frightened people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To paraphrase the words of a song, "If there is a wrong way to do it, nobody does it like them." Clearly, we have

	<span class='label label-info column'>227</span>
heard an overwhelming case for a national licensing scheme. Incidentally, I am happy that the hon. Member for Scarborough supports his local Labour council. That is a step in the right direction—not long to wait before he can go the whole way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's intention is sinister. They want see the private rented sector grow, yet they abdicate the responsibility of ensuring equality of treatment for those who will suffer. How can the Government call it consultation exercise when they ignore 76 per cent. of those consulted, who agreed on a particular course?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about people's lives in a sector with an appalling record. The Government have created an environment to encourage the private sector. They have gone for six-month assured tenancies, and have increased the opportunities to repossess tenancies in difficult situations. They have created an environment to help the landlord and others to invest in that sector. If statistics are accepted, the regulations must be mandatory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sykes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Every member of every party in Scarborough borough council supports the measures already adopted—it is not simply a Labour initiative. Will the hon. Gentleman answer the question that the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr O'Brien)? refused to answer? All parties represented on Scarborough borough council have endorsed the proposals contained in the Bill. The hon. Gentleman should accept that the fact that the scheme, which is optional not mandatory, has the support of a Labour council such as Scarborough, goes a long way towards showing that his argument is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sutcliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That was a couple of you's too far. A few you's have been straying around this morning.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sutcliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. McWilliam. It is the intensity of the problems created by the Government that drive me down that route.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

He said that all groups on Scarborough borough council have accepted the report—but he did not accept it; he wants more intensive planning regulations. If it is right for the hon. Member for Scarborough to change his mind after reading the Bill, I imagine that if he canvasses Labour members of the council, he will find that they, too will have changed their minds in favour of our amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I call Mr. Sutcliffe, bearing in mind that the subject for debate is whether there should be a mandatory regime, not the internal workings of Scarborough borough council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sutcliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Member for Scarborough is an honourable man. I am sure that after listening to the quality of the debate this morning he will change his mind and support our proposals. We shall have to wait and see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case has clearly been made. We are talking about people's lives and a sector that has an appalling record. I was happy to do some work for British Gas about carbon monoxide poisoning in student accommodation in Bradford—in houses of multiple occupation—where landlords had not met their responsibilities. If there had been a national licensing scheme, the local authority would have become involved. Bradford local authority has an excellent record on environmental health, but dramatic cuts have been imposed by central Government over the years, and the proportion of spending on environmental health has diminished. It is now for tenants to blow the whistle with local authorities; if there was a licensing scheme HMO tenants would have to opt in, which would assist local authorities to ensure good standards of practice. Environmental health officers in Bradford tell me that they estimate that 3,000 HMOs are not visited; voluntary agreements have to be made with good landlords, who want to play the game and who want to develop. We want standards to be raised. The Government have the responsibility, but they abdicate it. If they decide that the private rented sector should develop and that HMOs should grow, they must be responsible for ensuring equality of treatment for everyone. They are responsible for the sector and for ensuring that those standards are achieved. Opposition Members want equality of treatment for everybody.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Second Reading, I welcomed the progress that the Government were making on housing in multiple occupation, but argued that they could go further. I am now beginning to wonder whether that guarded welcome went to far. Even though it is fair to say that the Government are trying to simplify the 17 Acts of Parliament and the regulations that provide for controls on conditions in the private sector, their proposals and, in particular, the absence of a mandatory licensing scheme, worry me more and more as the debate goes on. I am not worried only by the absence of a mandatory licensing scheme in isolation, but by the absence of that scheme in the context of the exclusions, which we will talk about this afternoon. If one takes those factors together, they are very serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having heard the Minister, I do not understand why the Government are opposing a national licensing scheme. They introduced a consultation document, to which many hon. Members have already referred. As my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich said, it is a consultation paper on the case for licensing. The Government said that they had an open mind. It is interesting that they called the consultation paper, "The Case For Licensing". Over the past few minutes, I have been speculating about why the Government wanted to put out a different consultation paper in Wales. I asked them why that was the case and did not get a clear reply. I wonder whether it was because the thrust, title and overwhelming logic of the first paper are in favour of a national licensing scheme. The paper outlines the arguments against such a scheme, but, even with the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0134">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>229</span>
Government's logic and before anybody had responded to that paper, the arguments against the scheme did not stand up. The Government responded to the replies to the consultation paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to correct an impression and to learn from what has happened this morning. I learned a lot about how we should issue consultation papers. There is a set of arguments in favour of licensing and another against it, which everybody acknowledges. The Opposition seem to think that the Government had, therefore, to opt for one proposition or its alternative. That is not the case. We listened and then framed the proposition that is now before the Committee. It is a balance between those two sets of propositions. We do not have to buy one agenda or the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no objection to the consultation paper that the Government issued in England. It is excellent. What worries and disturbs me is why, given that paper and what the Minister said about the paper not coming down on one side or the other, it was so unacceptable in Wales. That strikes me as odd. Ministers might disagree, but I think that the reason for that was that the logic of that paper, having presented both sides of the argument, was that a national licensing scheme was the right choice. That is not surprising because that is what most of the responses said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know what the Government said when they had received those replies. Seventy-six per cent. were in favour of a mandatory licensing scheme. A press notice from the Department of the Environment on 22 November 1995 noted that
	<br><blockquote><p>"a majority of respondents to the 1995 consultation paper welcomed the proposals in principle".</p></blockquote>
I guess that that welcome is rather like my welcome on Second Reading. It means, "You have made some steps forward but why didn't you take the really necessary step of introducing a mandatory licensing scheme?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why are the Government against a mandatory licensing scheme? As my hon. Friends have already said, the Government believe that such a scheme would be costly and bureaucratic. Let us examine those two propositions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have gone wide; at the moment, the issue before us is whether the clause should apply to one council or to all councils. The mandatory element comes in the next group of amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. McWilliam. However, the Government's argument against a mandatory scheme is that it would be costly, which is why it seems relevant to this group of amendments. The Government's argument against the introduction of such a scheme was outlined in the consultation paper. I shall not dwell on the subject, save to say that all the evidence suggests that, given a fairly modest fee, a mandatory licensing scheme could be self-financing. It would not be costly. Indeed, Ministers have said today that registration could prove more costly for local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>230</span>
The main reason for having a mandatory scheme has nothing to do with cost. Even if such a scheme were costly, it would still be right to introduce it if it were necessary. The real reason why we need a mandatory scheme is the appalling conditions of houses in multiple occupation. Some 40 per cent. of HMOs, according to the English house conditions survey of 1991, are unfit for human habitation. The 1985 physical and social survey of HMOs showed that 80 per cent. lack adequate means of escape from fire. Some 98 per cent. of local authorities rate inadequate fire safety, provision as the most prevalent problem. That evidence comes from the Campaign for Bedsit Rights. May I add my commendations to those of my hon. Friends for the work that that organisation has done on this issue?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An average of three people per week die in bedsit fires, according to the United Kingdom fire statistics, published by the Home Office. The risk of fire, as we have heard today, is 28 times greater in HMOs that in self-contained housing. Health and Safety Executive statistics show that about 30 people a year die from carbon monoxide poisoning from faulty gas appliances, mostly in private rented housing.

In Birmingham, about 5,000 houses are in multiple occupation. Local authority evidence is that far too many of them are insanitary, unsafe and, in some cases, downright dangerous. We know that the use of those properties is likely to expand; there is little doubt of that, given the changes in housing policy. The South Birmingham young homeless project, which does a lot of work in assisting young people to find accommodation in my corner of the city, did a survey of those whom it helped to accommodate in 1994–95. Of the 189 young people the project was able to help, just in that corner of the city, no fewer than 80 of them were accommodated in hostels. As my hon. Friend the Member of Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson) rightly pointed out, it was not a cheap option, considering the high rents in the areas where some of the young people were accommodated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those reasons have weighed heavily on the minds of not only Opposition but Conservative members of the Committee. I congratulate the hon. Members for Scarborough and for Blackpool, North on their survey of coastal towns and on bringing the matter to the attention of the public. I also congratulate the hon. Member for Scarborough on his speech on Second Reading. In relation to the appalling tragedy in his constituency in 1994, the hon. Gentleman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The case for a licensing scheme was cast into hideous focus". [	<i>Official Report,</i> 29 January 1996, Vol. 279, c. 696.]</p></blockquote>
He was right about that, and we should pay tribute to the work that he has done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Atkinson) also spoke on Second Reading about the need for a licensing scheme, but he suggested that it should be one that local authorities could opt into. That is the nub of today's debate—and the nub of the problem. I appreciate that there might need to be different take-up levels for a licensing scheme in different towns, cities and areas, but there is no logic in the idea that the standards applicable should vary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned not about whether a local authority has the right to opt into a scheme but whether the tenant
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0135">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>231</span>
has such a right. Under the Bill the tenant has no such right. How can a tenant who wants to live in a certain area in certain accommodation be assured that the standard of that accommodation is as high as the standard that applies up the road?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with much of what the hon. Gentleman said about tenants. Does he agree that part of the problem is not just the effect of houses in multiple occupation on those who live in them but, in many cases—particularly in seaside resorts, as my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and I well know—the effect that badly run HMOs have on businesses and local residents in the surrounding area? That is why we especially wanted the Government to consider some mechanism to take account of that. The proposal for taking into account the effect of HMOs on the local economy and local amenity that the Government are now considering under the registration and control provisions is of particular importance to my constituents. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that is absolutely essential?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an entirely valid point. There is no dispute about the problems that exist in his area and in others that hon. Members have highlighted. The difference between the parties concerns whether there should be a mandatory licensing scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members advanced the case for a mandatory scheme. We believe that it would be simpler than an opt-in registration scheme and that it would be cost-effective and in the interest of tenants. I am sure that all Conservative members of the Committee have a genuine concern about the problem, and a number of them have played an important role in highlighting and bringing it to public attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Scarborough said that the report drawn up by him and his hon. Friends involved only coastal towns, because those were the towns that they represented—so they were not concerned with Bradford and various other areas. I take that to mean that the report focused on certain areas because the hon. Gentleman, as a representative of one such area, had a particular concern about them. I do not believe that the hon. Gentleman meant that he and other Conservative Members are not concerned about areas other than coastal towns and that it does not matter what standards they have or whether tenants living in them are protected. I am sure that he did not mean that it does not matter whether houses in multiple occupation in Birmingham, for example, are up to standard. If he did not mean that, surely the conclusion is inescapable—there must be an enforceable minimum standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposals make no such suggestion, so it will be an accident of geography that decides whether one's accommodation is up to scratch. Surely no one here would agree with that. There is an easy way out of the problem. I appeal to Conservative Members who have made an important contribution to the debate to follow their own logic, as expressed in their speeches on Second Reading and elsewhere, and support us in seeking a mandatory licensing scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>232</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why should houses in multiple occupation in some parts of the country not be subject to registration? I assumed that Conservative Members would explain why that is right, but no one has. In his interesting contribution, the Minister, if I understood him correctly, went as far as to characterise local authorities that do not take up the powers as rogue councils. If that is the Government's view, why on earth is not the scheme mandatory? Why are not those responsibilities being given to every local authority, as the amendment provides? The Bill implies that HMOs in some parts of the country are not subject to registration. Why is that right?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like other hon. Members, I am puzzled as to why licensing has been dropped. The Government consultation paper accepted that there was a case for licensing. The head of environmental housing in my borough commented:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Government has rejected completely the concept of licensing is much regretted. Licensing was seen as a way of turning around the way Local Authorities deal with HMO's and also how Landlords viewed/managed their properties."</p></blockquote>
The Government clearly thought in 1994 that there was a case. More than three quarters of responses supported licensing. Why has that case been thrown out?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interesting exchange that we had about Wales suggests that the case was perhaps thrown out because it was caught up in the lurch to the right in the middle of last year, when there was internecine warfare in the Conservative party. I am grateful that the Minister is sending us a copy of the letter sent by the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) on the subject. It will be interesting to discover whether it sets out the reasons for licensing as clearly as did the Department of the Environment consultation paper. The case for licensing was either a victim of the lurch to the right or the objections of landlords and their representatives swung the argument against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand why bad landlords do not want the scheme—their ability to earn a living from the death traps and public nuisances for which they are responsible will be ended. But no one wants that to continue. Good landlords have a great deal to gain from a national licensing scheme. They would benefit from reduced uncertainty over the standards required of them and from an improvement in the public image of private renting. There would be additional costs in making license applications and in carrying out repairs and improvements, but they would involve inspecting and maintaining properties only to ensure that they met current legal minimum standards. There should not be additional significant costs for landlords who already manage properties to those standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I quote the view of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health when it learnt of the Government's response to its consultation:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Chartered Institute has supported the concept of licensing for HMOs since at least 1985; it considers that licensing would have a number of unique benefits. These were set out in the Chartered Institute's response to the Department's paper … we still believe that a national, uniform, mandatory licensing scheme is necessary, that its benefits cannot all be achieved otherwise and we are disappointed, not least given the overwhelming weight of opinion behind our views, that the Government does not accept these arguments."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Committee will accept the arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an important debate. It is impossible to reply to everything that has been said, but certain points deserve a response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Normanton and for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe) were concerned about gas appliances and fire risk. I remind them that regulations under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1994 require landlords to have gas appliances checked annually by Confederation of Registered Gas Installers engineers and that criminal sanctions are involved. Licensing would be but duplication.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. OBrien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who is responsible for policing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be easier if I wrote to the hon. Gentleman, to give him full chapter and verse on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fire statistics quoted were somewhat misleading. There have been 150 deaths, but that is from all multi-occupied buildings, including local authority tower blocks that are not HMOs. Deaths in bedsits make up only one third of the total. It is a serious problem, but it does not help to exaggerate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that there might be no registration scheme in some instances, but other powers, will still be available. Many local authorities now take action under section 352 enforcement procedures and the mandatory fire duty will have to be acted on by all local authorities. In addition, the new duty of care in clause 69 will apply to all HMO landlords. Action will still be taken, but with greater flexibility. It has been pointed out that many councils are under the control of the Labour party or the Liberal Democrats, so I wonder whether Opposition Members will reflect on which of those councils would not fulfil the obligations that they can best meet under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has been extended to consideration of a national licensing scheme that would perhaps be run from Marsham street. However, only the smallest difference lies between the two sides of the Committee. There is no practical difference between us, and when the legislation is in force in a year or so, many of us will be wondering what we were arguing about today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a fundamental difference between the two sides of the Committee on how to go about tackling the problem. Opposition Members believe that there should be a single, national, mandatory scheme, applying in every area. It would ensure safety, raise standards and make absolutely sure that people's lives are protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not respond to the Minister's points about the number of people who die in fires or as a result of defective gas appliances. The truth is that too many people die and, whatever stastistics one uses, it is clear that the risk is far greater in multi-occupied houses than elsewhere. That risk should be dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have advanced three arguments against our proposals. First, they say that they accept the need for tighter powers and for more effective enforcement but will not require those powers to be in force across the country. They say that they want such powers but they will leave it up to local authorities to decide whether to implement them. That is not credible. We must protect people wherever they live. We must raise standards in all areas of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>234</span>
Secondly, the Minister said that he was opposed to excessive centralism and in favour of real devolution. That sits extraordinarily ill with the proposal to issue a code of guidance and a model scheme. If the Government believe in a model scheme, they should have the courage of their convictions and impose one throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly—the most extraordinary argument of all—the Minister of State said that our proposals could not be enforced. What a pathetic argument. They are the Government and they cannot see how such a scheme would be enforced. It is Government's responsibility to ensure that action is taken to protect the lives of citizens and that the law is enforced. As Ministers know only too well, if local authorities fail to discharge their responsibilities under a national licensing scheme, not only the Government can act and remind them of their duties. Individual citizens—tenants living at risk in multi-occupied houses—can take the law into their own hands. They can seek a judicial review of a local authority's failure to perform its duties. The Minister knows that is an extremely effective power for the people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition Members want action to protect people, to give them more say and control, and to put an end to such abuses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ministers have argued that Labour-controlled Scarborough district council is against the national mandatory scheme. Is my hon. Friend surprised to hear that I have just received a message from Councillor Mavis Don, the leader of Scarborough district council—in fact, Labour is the largest party on the council but it does not have an overall majority—stating that Scarborough district council has been solid in its support for a national mandatory licensing scheme? That has been particularly so since the fire at the Richmond hotel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for reminding the Committee of that.
