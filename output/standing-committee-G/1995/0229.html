	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [27 February]:</i> No. 304, in page 60, line 17, after "(1)", to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to subsections (1A) and (1B)".—[	<i>Mr. Raynsford</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 305, in page 60, line 23, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) No notice shall be required where possession is sought under ground 17 of Schedule 2 to this Act.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(1B) Where possession is sought under ground 17 and the court dismisses the claim for possession under that ground, the court shall also consider whether to make an order for possession under grounds 1 to 4 of Schedule 2 to this Act and may make an order for possession and exercise the powers contained in section 85 notwithstanding that no notice has been served relating to those grounds as required by this section.".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 317, in page 62, line 1, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) In section 84 of that Act after subsection 2 insert—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'(3) If the Court is satisfied that the ground 17 in Part IIIA of Schedule 2 to this Act is established then the court shall make an order for possession':".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 306, in page 62 line 1, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) In section 84 of that Act for subsection (3) there shall be substituted—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'Save where the court dispenses with the notice under section 83(1)(b) or where subsection 83(1B) applies, the court shall not make such an order on any of the grounds in Parts I to III of that Schedule unless the ground is specified in the notice in pursuance of which proceedings for possession are begun; but the ground so specified may be altered or added to with the leave of the court.'.".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>New clause 16—	<i>New ground of misuse of drugs: possession order</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>"After ground 16 in Schedule 2 to the Housing Act 1985 insert the following—</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>"PART IIIA</p>
	<p>GROUNDS ON WHICH COURT MUST ORDER POSSESSION</p>
	<p>GROUND 17</p>
	<p>The tenant or a person residing in the dwelling house has been convicted of an offence under section 4 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (production or supply of controlled drugs) and that offence was committed in the dwelling house or within the vicinity of the dwelling house.</p>
	<p>For the purposes of this ground the phrase 'the vicinity of the dwelling house' shall be defined as set out in ground 2 in Part I of this Schedule'.".</p>
	<p>New clause 17—	<i>Special expedited possession procedure</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Section 111(2) of the Housing Act 1985 shall be amended by adding a new subsection (c) as follows:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'(c) for an expedited procedure where possession is sought under grounds 2 to 4 and 17 in Schedule 2 or under ground 1 in that Schedule where the conduct complained of is a breach of an obligation of the tenancy other than an obligation for the payment of money to be landlord'.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>404</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At our previous sitting we were discussing how to deal with drug dealers who lived in tenanted properties. My hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford) had moved the amendment that would make drug dealing grounds for mandatory possession of properties. He was absolutely right to take such a tough stance. I hope that the Committee agrees that such a stance must be taken to deal with people who peddle drugs, especially those who peddle drugs to children, as often happens on estates. It is important to reflect the wishes of our constituents. My constituents would certainly want to go much further than simply making the homes of drug dealers subjected to mandatory possession. The issue is worrying. Only a few months ago, the head of a local primary school complained to me about a person peddling drugs outside gates. All available sanctions must be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now deal with some problems that might arise from the amendment. The subject of double jeopardy has been raised. I do not regard that as an issue because people often receive two punishments for committing one offence. For example, an accountant who defaults his company will probably end up in gaol and, at the same time, lose his job. No one argues that that should not happen if someone commits a serious fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the grounds for possession in schedule 2 of the Housing Act 1985, if a person smashes up his home and the homes of his neighbours, he loses his home because he is in breach of the tenancy conditions. That person can also be prosecuted for criminal damage. To protect people who live in the neighbourhood, people who commit such offences should be made to cease occupying their property. We should accept that. We should regard it not as an arbitrary and wilful double punishment but as action taken for proper reasons to protect people in the neighbourhood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon Friend accept that the problem with double jeopardy is that the courts can take into account the circumstances? They may give a lighter sentence to someone who stole money from a company and who lost his job as a result. The two matters are taken into account. If we are not careful, the situation will arise in which the courts deal with the offence of drug trafficking, but do not wish to punish someone else in the household with the loss of the tenancy. That is the difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there are clear grounds for possession, the courts probably can take that into account. When the courts decide the punishment for a crime, there is a separate issue to be decided about the tenancy of a property, given the threat that someone else who lives in the house might continue to pose to other people in the area by peddling drugs. It is reasonable that that should be a ground for possession, as well as the courts having sanctions on criminals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) said that the clause dealt only with tenants, not with owner-occupiers. I accept my hon. Friend's argument. We are dealing with the relationship between a landlord and a tenant—a relationship that cannot exist for owner-occupiers. However, that is not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0233">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>405</span>
necessarily a reason for taking no action against someone dealing in drugs from a local authority house. In a later part of the Bill, we shall deal with similar powers against owner-occupiers as well as tenants. Local authorities should be able to take action against both—a basic rule that we should try to uphold. Although grounds for possession apply only to tenanted properties, we should not hold back simply because we cannot deal similarly with owner-occupiers. Indeed, many grounds for possession are to be found in housing legislation. Obviously, they can be used only against tenants, but no one is saying that grounds for possession should not include failure to pay rent, damaging property or other anti-social behaviour simply because such action cannot be taken against owner-occupiers. We should be seen to be taking a hard line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) asked in the previous sitting what might happen to the children if the parents lost their home. That is a tragic circumstance, and local authorities will have to decide whether to rehouse someone or whether the homelessness is intentional and take other action to deal with the children. However, that problem has to be faced when possession is taken on other grounds under other housing legislation. Local authorities have to come to a view about the cause of the homelessness and then decide what housing arrangements should be made. We shall deal with homelessness later. Grounds for possession already exist. We wish to introduce a mandatory ground for possession for people who peddle drugs and blight the lives of young people on housing estates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that most council tenants would welcome our taking a strong line. I hope that the two sides of the Committee will reach agreement. I realise that some of the wording may need to be changed, and that we need to take account of some of the points raised in debate. However, a tough stance is right and it should be supported.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration (Mr. David Curry)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that there is no misunderstanding, I shall make clear where I believe that we should seek common ground and why I am cautious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essence of new clauses 16 and 17 is that a tenant or other person can be evicted after having been convicted of dealing in drugs in or near the house, and that the eviction should be mandantory. That is the heart of the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The drafting of the new clauses causes me some concern. One can easily sketch the domesday scenarios that they might lead to. One has to consider the extreme cases. I think, for instance, of a widowed mother living in a council house with a son of 19 or 20 who lives at home. He is a big lad and his mother cannot control him—he probably supports Millwall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Minister that giving dogs bad names is not good. Millwall football club works closely with the local community and the council. It has been at the forefront
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>406</span>
in Kicking Racism out of Football and should be commended rather than denigrated by the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the Committee goes too far, I like watching Newcastle United matches, but that is not the subject of our debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are quite right, Mr. Me William. If I may, however, I should point out that I last watched football when Everton was defeated at home by two goals to four by Millwall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to my story. The son is convicted and, under Labour's proposals, the neighbours put pressure on the council because they want the woman to be evicted, but what happens when he returns and his mates are still around? There are genuine worries. The court would not have discretion under the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take another example. A single parent has a live-in boyfriend and dare not kick him out—we are all familiar with such cases. The boyfriend deals in drugs and is convicted. What will happen then? Will the children go into care and will the mother be evicted? Those are the questions that cause me to be concerned. Moreover, there are other offences—murder, child abuse and paedophilia, for example—that are not covered by the proposals. People convicted of those offences would not lose their homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to the Committee that clause 108 will cover such circumstances. It does not include the concept of vicinity, but it would be reasonable for us to incorporate it. I do not want to rehearse the discussions that we had on Tuesday about the phrasing—whether we should use the word "locality"—but we could introduce the concept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 108 will also cover visitors to the dwelling house, which the Opposition proposals would not. It will apply to those who live in the house occasionally. The clause also covers a person who
	<br><blockquote><p>"has been convicted of using the dwelling-house or allowing it to be used for immoral or illegal purposes."</p></blockquote>
It covers prostitution, paedophilia and receiving stolen goods, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should bring together the proposals and embrace them in an effective formulation. I also accept that we need to ensure that the law works effectively. That does not necessarily lend itself to formulation in the Bill, although it is a subject of importance to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall examine how we can reinforce the measures to embrace the Opposition proposals that the Committee finds acceptable, and also how we can make the operation of the law more effective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Raynsford 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Committee knows, this is a serious issue. Since our debates on Tuesday, I have received further representations from a number of quarters, urging me to press the Government further, to reassure communities all over the country who feel extremely threatened by the activities of drug dealers in their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An appalling case in Canterbury has been brought to my attention. A housing association that owns most of the houses in an inner-city street was forced to rehouse all its tenants to enable it to deal with one tenant who was dealing in controlled drugs from the property. He was preventing anyone else from coming into the street
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0234">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>407</span>
by threatening visitors and housing association staff. Until all the other tenants were rehoused away from the street, none of them were prepared to give evidence against the dealer, as they were terrified of being intimidated or beaten up, or suffering an even worse penalty. That is real life; that is the problem that we are dealing with, which is why tough sanctions are necessary, and why we want the Bill to provide tougher and clearer grounds for possession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Appalling as the example that my hon. Friend has given may be, new clause 16 would not deal with it. Until an individual has been convicted, the housing association cannot apply for a possession order. What is important is that the police get a grip of such situations, and do not have the excuse that it is up to the housing association to deal with the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept entirely my hon. Friend's point that the proposals will not cover all circumstances. The point that I stressed emphatically on Tuesday was that this House had a responsibility to send out a message that such behaviour was unacceptable; that people who behaved in such ways could expect not only the criminal law to come down on them heavily, as we all agree that it should, but to lose their homes. It is wrong that people should threaten, damage and intimidate a community and expect to continue to have the right to live in that community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Tuesday, the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I undertake to examine the points that he has made and work out how we can use new clause 16 as the basis for producing more effective action. We shall obviously have to be careful about the definitions—how far a tenant's activities are linked to the fact that he resided in the area. We may be able to use ground 2 of the 1985 Act, which concerns nuisance and annoyance in a locality, to include some of those sorts of activity."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee G,</i> 27 February 1996; c. 400.]</p></blockquote>
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am slightly troubled because the Minister is backtracking from that rather clear commitment to use new clause 16 as the basis for measures. I must press the Minister further on that. We want more effective action to ensure that people who have behaved in a way that has caused appalling anxiety, suffering and grief in a community should not be able to continue to live there and intimidate their neighbours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gave examples of hard cases and, in a way, I am rather pleased that he did. During previous sittings, the Minister has said that he is sorry, but he cannot allow the hard cases that the Opposition have raised to divert the Government from the intention of their legislation. On at least two occasions, the Minister has said that there will be innocent victims, but that that does not take away the justice of what the Government are doing. I am intrigued that he is not taking a different line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the first example that he used, if the son had been convicted of drug dealing because the mother was incapable of controlling him, the neighbourhood would be terrified, not surprisingly, at the prospect of the son leaving prison and returning to die neighbourhood because presumably the mother would still be unable to control him. The obvious, logical solution would be for the council to obtain possession of the property and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>408</span>
rehouse the mother elsewhere so that she could live separately from her son. If that were done, the other people in the community would not think that they were likely to receive an unwelcome visit from the imprisoned drug dealer as soon as he was released from prison.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where would he go then? Would he not live with his mother wherever she was living? Is not the hon. Gentleman advocating a policy under which people are dumped in parts of an estate where all the sink cases, as it were, are found? The son will go back to live with his mother, and a different set of neighbours will have the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to make exactly the point that I am trying to make. A line should be drawn under previous circumstances, and one should say, "That is it; the son cannot go back to that community." Whether or not the mother chooses to have him back in a different home is, of course, up to her. However, she would know that she had lost her tenancy and been evicted because she had failed to control her son. That message would ensure that she knew that she would have to exercise more control over her son if she were to have him back. Therefore, the example that the Minister uses reinforces our case, rather than his case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of the live-in boyfriend, the Minister undermined his own argument when he said in a different context that visitors were not dealt with in our proposals, whereas the Government intended to include them. If the live-in boyfriend were a visitor, he would not be dealt with. We did not want the new clause to be so widely drawn as to be open to potential abuse. We want to produce an effective framework of law which will send a clear message to the outside world that the community will not tolerate such unacceptable behaviour and that there will be tough sanctions against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will repeat the undertaking which he gave on Tuesday to use new clause 16 as the basis for new provisions which will have that effect. We accept that there are grounds for possibly linking such a measure with the likelihood of future nuisance. That would deal with the anxieties that several of my hon. Friends, among others, have raised. We should be only too happy to take on board such perfectly sensible amendments to the concepts if the Minister were to propose them later. However, we should not be happy if the Minister said that the existing provisions of the law were acceptable and there was no need for more than minor tinkering. The evidence from local authorities and housing associations throughout the country is that the present position is unacceptable. They find it very difficult to fight for decent values and to protect communities against people who have behaved appallingly. I hope that the Minister will give us the kind of undertaking that we are seeking; if he does, we will be happy to withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under new clause 17 we are seeking expedited proceedings, which are essential. General expression of concern that courts do not deal with things quickly enough will not suffice. We must have evidence that the Government will ensure that where people are making the lives of communities an utter misery, proceedings to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0235">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>409</span>
get them out can be undertaken quickly and will not be bogged down in lengthy and complex legal procrastination. I hope that the Minister can offer us some joy on that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always suspicious when people talk about sending messages. What matters is not just the message but what is done in practice to help people deal with a problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that introductory remark. Will he pass that message on to the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Bolton, West (Mr. Sackville), who was so keen to grab headlines? It is dangerous for the Government to claim that they will do something about the problem when—as the Minister and I know—it will be extremely difficult to do so. While the Minister may legitimately make that comment to my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich, he should also to make it to the Under-Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Politicians have a tendency to make exhortations and to send messages. That is no doubt part of our vocation. However, we also have a duty to deliver measures that work on the ground. My concern is that when tackling what is—let us be fair—a spectacular problem we must not create a mechanism that may or may not be effective, but will have much wider implications. We might regret that. The absence of discretion for the court is at the heart of my concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not retreat from what I said at column 400 of the 	<i>Official Report</i> of Tuesday's sitting. I will look for ways in which we can provide effective measures to express our concern that give local authorities, housing associations and landlords effective powers to deal with the problem. Those measures will be based on clause 108, and I shall consider the hon. Gentleman's amendments to see how their intentions—where I agree with them—can be incorporated in the redrafting that we shall propose on Report. I give the hon. Gentleman that promise; I have reflected deeply on the matter; the Committee will appreciate that while I recognise the problem, I am anxious to ensure that we deliver a solution with which we can live in the long term.

I have undertaken to consider how to make the system work more effectively. The hon. Gentleman will know that that will involve the Lord Chancellor's Department.

The Minister has moved a series of amendments to tidy up provisions relating to serving notices and other such matters, which we happily accept, but we think that he has missed one.

The amendment would remove the requirement for the notice when notice has been dispensed with under section 83. It will make the clause consistent. It is necessary to make the legislation hang together and make sense and is moved in the spirit of many of our amendments, which is to improve the legislation.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is very perceptive this morning. It may help if I explain what his amendment is about so that he will understand why I cannot accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would introduce into section 84 of the Housing Act 1985 a series of factors to be taken into account by the judge when considering whether it is reasonable to make an order for possession. I do not believe that that is necessary or desirable. Under the current system, there are certain grounds on which the court may order possession if it considers it reasonable—usually for breach of the tenancy agreement, rent arrears, nuisance or annoyance and using the premises for illegal or immoral purposes. The local authority will have prepared its case and the defendant will have his day in court to put his side. Ultimately, it is left to the judge to decide whether possession is reasonable. I consider that that is a fair system and it would be wrong to attempt to fetter judicial discretion by dictating what factors must be considered when the court decides on the reasonableness of eviction. Establishing factors in the Bill would remove the flexibility of the courts by directing them to give weight to particular aspects in preference to others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the Minister said about influencing the court or the judge, would not it have another effect? If there were a provision in the Bill that influenced the quality of life of the people in a community, it would be taken into consideration, regardless of the judge's position. At least there would be certain issues that would be noted and the judge would have to consider them. I believe that such a provision should be included in the legislation to ensure that the tenant's best interests are safeguarded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>412</span>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The argument can be made either way. My argument would be that if we list factors in the Bill, the court will have to have regard to them. The problem with any list is what is in it and what is left out of it. Unless die list is comprehensive—which might limit its effect—there is a danger that it will not allow the defence or the prosecution to consider factors that may be relevant in a particular case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill puts in place an effective package of measures. Strengthened grounds for possession will make it easier to take someone to court. Speeded-up possession proceedings will mean that the authority can get the trouble-maker into court more quickly. The power of arrest can be attached to injunctions to restrain anti-social behaviour, where violence has occurred or is threatened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that the list is not exclusive, and that other factors could be taken into account by the court? We tabled the amendment because we believe that judges do not always take into account all the circumstances. Perhaps judges are not familiar with what happens on some estates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that if we follow the hon. Gentleman's counsel, situations may arise in which the court acknowledges that certain circumstances are relevant, but, because of what is written in the Bill, feels unable to take account of them in a way that it would consider appropriate. The argument can be played either way. My choice is not to give prescriptive guidance to the court, as the hon. Gentleman proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the non-legislative front, the Department, with the local authority associations and others, is a member of Lord Woolfs working group on housing that is dealing with the housing aspects of the "Access to Justice" inquiry. We are focusing on speeding up court procedures and measures on witness intimidation, to see whether more can be done in practical terms to help in possession cases where anti-social behaviour is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also about to issue guidance to local authorities on how to make the best use of the court system. The associations have been consulted and I hope that the document will be useful to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that by inserting more and more detail in the legislation, we will necessarily help to bring eviction cases to fruition. Good preparation, swift handling and good liaison with the local courts are more likely to concentrate the mind of the court than prescribing to judges the special factors that they should take into consideration. Accordingly, I invite the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to probe the Minister's argument. Experience shows that a possession order is usually made because of a tenant's anti-social behaviour, leading to a complaint from others living in the block of flats or the area. Often, when a person is accused of anti-social behaviour and a repossession order is made, the person can defend himself. If the matter goes to court, people will be required to give evidence relating to the complaint and the application for repossession. That is when the problem starts.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0237">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>413</span>
People are sometimes reluctant to go to court and give evidence because of the possible consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is nothing before the judge relating to the specific complaint, the decision could go in favour of someone who was guilty of an offence. The process of British justice would have to start all over again. The amendment would allow certain issues to be considered by the judge without the witness having to appear in court. In other words, the judge could ask questions on the various subjects listed in the amendment, including the conduct of the complainant, the effect of the behaviour and the vulnerability of other persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The converse of the amendment would be for someone to go to court and plead that those are the issues on which they want the judge or the magistrate to decide. It would be a constructive move to give courts the opportunity to consider the issues rationally and make judgments on matters that cause problems in communities, on estates and in blocks of flats. To list the issues concerned, as in the amendment, would ensure that all the relevant facts and evidence were considered by the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The representative of the local authority or landlord could refer to the list, which would be set down in legislation, rather than having to find a witness to substantiate the reasons for the repossession order. My experience shows that people with a genuine complaint are sometimes reluctant to attend court, for fear of what could happen after the hearing—regardless of whether the defendant is found guilty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would have a constructive effect, as the courts' ability to consider a list of items would help to settle issues in communities in which there is a cancer of a minority causing problems for the majority. The Minister should be aware of the other side of his argument and consider the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister cannot accept the amendment, I would ask him to consider carefully the principle behind it, which is not far removed from what the Undersecretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Bolton, West has been saying about certain tenants and drug-related activities. Other issues can be as important, but if Ministers do not show the determination to act people will suffer because of the lack of protection in legislation. This is an opportunity to give such protection. I ask the Minister to reconsider what he said to us, or at least to consider the points that I have made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I respect the hon. Gentleman's concerns, but people's reluctance to go to court has nothing to do with the amendment, which would not solve the problem. The amendment would not allow witnesses not to have to give evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a little anxious when the hon. Gentleman said that all the evidence and all the facts would be considered. I am concerned about that, because there are bound to be factors other than those spelt out in the amendment. At the end of the day, we must choose either to spell out for the judge every single signpost on the way to his judgment or to make the assumption that the court, which will be experienced, will be able to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>414</span>
take into consideration whatever factors it deems necessary in the particular circumstances. The hon. Gentleman has not persuaded me, and I must persist in my opposition to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has to appreciate the anger, bitterness and frustration that exists on many council estates about the intolerable behaviour of a very small number of tenants. In my constituency not long ago, someone in a downstairs flat was faced, for some months, with disposable nappies being dropped out of the upstairs window so that they piled up in front of the window of the flat downstairs. The annoyance caused by such action is great. What happens if the neighbour also hears repeated noise and banging on the floor of the upstairs flat? What if the people upstairs have neighbours coming round at all times of the night and are abusive when their neighbour objects?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, quite reasonably, the neighbour complains to the housing officer, who says, "I'll have a word with the tenant." The housing officer and the tenant end up having a barney, in which the tenant claims that he is being victimised and that the person downstairs is exaggerating the problem. The housing officer tells the downstairs neighbour, "I've had a word with the person upstairs and the behaviour is going to change." But it does not change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the downstairs neighbour presses further, the housing officer realises that the neighbour's behaviour is outrageous and that the problem is serious. It is then referred to the legal department. It is a bit unfair on Stockport Council, but I am afraid that its legal department has two speeds—slow and very slow. It is either cautious or very cautious. There is a great reluctance to start court proceedings, but eventually, after much pressure and perhaps six or seven months of continuing nuisance, court proceedings are started. The trouble is that there is a 50:50 chance of success. The person upstairs turns up in court looking smart and respectable as if none of the problems reported could have happened. Sadly, too many judges have not lived on a council estate next to someone awkward, difficult or anti-social.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister cannot accept the amendment, we need very clear guidance. I know that such guidance cannot require all judges to have lived in the circumstances that I have described, as I would wish, so that they knew more about the reality of these situations. However, local authorities should have a clear timetable to which they can work, so that such a matter is disposed of in a couple of weeks at the most, rather than taking month after month while the nuisance continues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perfectly reasonable to wait for evidence, but once the housing officer has it, I do not see why people should have to wait for a long time before the lawyers bring the case to court. I hope that the Minister can introduce a greater measure of speed and certainty into the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment spells out a long list of anti-social activities. People's ingenuity is amazing when it comes to how many things they can do that their neighbours find intolerable. Most reasonable people would never believe that such things go on, but they do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0238">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>415</span>
In considering this issue, I ask the Minister to understand the anger that exists on many council estates and, increasingly, on housing association estates about the behaviour of perhaps a handful of tenants, who make life intolerable for the other people living there. Their behaviour also starts to affect the reputation of the estate. For the law-abiding people who live on the estate, who have some of the nicest and best-maintained properties in the country, that is a horrible stigma to bear. People in the town say, "If you live on such-and-such an estate, there must be something wrong with you." That is very upsetting. It is also upsetting if people cannot invite friends or relatives to their homes because someone living nearby behaves in a way that disgusts everybody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the Minister will not agree to the amendment, but I hope that there will be at least guidance and strong pressure on local authorities and housing associations to establish a process that will ensure that such cases come to court speedily. Ideally, we want the message to go out to tenants that such behaviour will make them likely to be evicted so that they cease to behave in such a way. Having said that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to chapter III of part V, which deals with the power of arrest for anti-social behaviour. The matter arouses considerable interest and support among those who suffer from such behaviour and all the other problems that we have discussed this morning and on Tuesday
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power of arrest is a means of reassuring threatened communities that tough action can be taken against the small minority of people who make their lives a misery. It is important that communities should be aware of the scope under the law for taking such action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would widen the circumstances in which courts can grant powers of arrest. Amendment No. 307 is a technical amendment. It makes it clear that the power to grant power of arrest will be exercised in response to a request from a landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 308 is one of those familiary amendments that seek to substitute the word "may" with the word "shall". That would place the onus on die court to act if the circumstances justify that action. I make it clear that that would not remove from the courts' judicial discretion. They could still look into the circumstances and, indeed, would have to be satisfied that the conditions were met before granting the power of arrest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those conditions are specific. The first is that the landlord is an appropriate landlord—a local authority, a housing action trust, a registered social landlord, or a charitable housing trust. The second condition is that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"respondent is the tenant or a joint tenant".</p></blockquote>
Thirdly, the tenancy must be "introductory, secure or assured", or other accommodation provided under the homelessness provisions of the Housing Act 1985.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0239">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>417</span>
Fourthly, the behaviour of the respondent must justify the application. According to the clause, that is
	<br><blockquote><p>"conduct which is, or is likely to be, a nuisance or annoyance to a person residing, visiting or otherwise engaging in a lawful activity"</p></blockquote>
in the locality, or
	<br><blockquote><p>"using or threatening to use the premises for immoral or illegal purposes, or · allowing any sub-tenant or lodger"</p></blockquote>
to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the behaviour conditions. Additionally, the court must be satisfied that there will be either a threat of violence or a risk of harm if the injunction with power of arrest is not granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those conditions are precise, and should ensure that the court will grant such powers of arrest only when the people concerned are manifestly causing a nuisance to their neighbours to a degree that is likely to cause either violence or harm to the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Ashby 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-West Leicestershire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon.

If so, can he explain why we have wasted a morning discussing powers of eviction for drug dealing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not regard debate about a serious matter, such as action to protect communities from drug dealing, as a waste of a morning. I am only sorry that the hon. Gentleman does not agree with that view. I do not believe that many people in his constituency or in the country share his view that that is a waste of time. We regard the matter as extremely serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman ought to be aware that we are now dealing with powers of arrest. Our previous debate concerned whether possession would be granted on people's tenancies. Those are different issues, even if the hon. Gentleman has difficulty understanding that. [Hon. Members: "He is a lawyer."] All the more reason for him to understand that there is a distinction between a power of arrest with an injunction and seeking possession of someone's home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 309 sets out the circumstances in which the landlord may seek the power of arrest, which are important. Local authorities obtain injunctions not just for breaches of tenancy, but in possession proceedings for nuisance or annoyance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many local authorities are also using or exploring ways of making contracts with other people that can be enforced through injunctions. Such contracts include community agreements, whereby all members of a community sign a code of conduct as enforceable as a contract with occupiers. A number of authorities, including Manchester, are at present considering the use of such agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other such contracts include occupation agreements, whereby people living with tenants, such as partners, adult sons or daughters—or the live-in lover, in the example that the Minister gave in an earlier debate—are asked to sign codes of conduct when a tenancy is signed, or later on. Authorities such as Rochdale and a number of housing associations have used such occupation agreements. I notice that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales, the hon. Member

for Cardiff, North (Mr. Jones) is looking especially interested at this point—and rightly so—because the South Wales Federated Housing Association is one association that has considered using such agreements. They are obvious and sensible ways to try to ensure that when a problem arises it is clear for the authority or association to take action against the perpetrators. Everyone living in the community will have signed an agreement not to behave in a way that causes nuisance or harm to other people, and breach of such agreements justifies landlords in seeking action. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the power of arrest can also be used where injunctions are taken out to enforce such agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 310 is technical. It would provide that an injunction with the power of arrest could apply even if a court were also seeking an injunction on other grounds. It would simply ensure that where an injunction was sought on other grounds, the court was not precluded from giving the power of arrest. The amendments are designed to give additional powers to landlords to take action against irresponsible and antisocial behaviour by individuals in the community. They widen the scope for making injunctions with the power of arrest. That would assist local authorities to fight against the small minority who often terrorise their communities, and would make it possible for more effective action to be taken against anti-social elements in the community. The amendments are eminently sensible, and go with the grain of the overwhelming weight of public opinion. I hope that the Minister will be able to accept them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Gwilym Jones)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate much of what the hon. Member for Greenwich said about amendments Nos. 307 and 308, but they go further than he suggested. Although I share his appreciation of what he wants to achieve, they seem to suggest that the power of arrest should be mandatory at the request of the applicant. I agree with him that courts must have a role in deciding whether the circumstances merit the arrest power being attached to an injunction, but some local authorities and tenants' organisations are concerned that vulnerable tenants or members of minority groups could fall foul of an inappropriate use of new, stronger powers. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that to be fair to all parties, it is essential that discretion should remain with the courts. We are as one on the purpose, but the amendments will not achieve what the hon. Gentleman wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that the Bill already does what he has in mind with amendments Nos. 309 and 310. Amendment No. 309 would add occupier as well as tenant, but the clause already covers the activities of sub-tenants or lodgers. The amendment also enables a power of arrest to be attached when possession proceedings for anti-social behaviour are taken. That is unnecessary because the grounds on which a power of arrest can be attached are wide enough to cover such behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would enable a power of arrest to be attached in cases where there had been a breach of an agreement between the applicant and the occupier. I assume that to be cases where the applicant has made an agreement about standards of behaviour. That applies

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>419</span>
not only to the dwelling house, but to other premises owned or managed by the applicant. Clause 115 already covers the dwelling and locality. As we said earlier this week, that is as wide as we should go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 310 seeks that the power of arrest should apply where there are other grounds in addition to those connected with breach of tenancy agreements. The amendment is unnecessary because nothing can prevent a court from attaching a power of arrest to an injunction that restricted other behaviour as well as that which is the subject of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 115 goes as far as is reasonable. The power of arrest must be defined as precisely as possible to ensure fairness and certainty. It is a strong power and it will provide a useful new weapon in the fight against antisocial behaviour. I therefore urge the hon. Gentleman not to press the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed by the Minister's reply. Although we should be careful about invading people's civil liberties, it is daft to grant an injunction without a power of arrest. If individuals are law-abiding, the power of arrest will not come into play. They will not suffer the power of arrest being added to the injunction; having observed the injunction, the power of arrest will not be used. However, some individuals will have no intention of following an injunction, and not adding the power of arrest seems totally illogical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that injunctions do not include the power of arrest because it makes work for lawyers. You go for the first injunction; you get one without the power of arrest; you then need a further breach of the conditions of the injunction—in other words the person continues to be a nuisance—so you then go back to the court, but are not necessarily able to get powers of arrest. Under the amendment, you would be able to have powers of arrest. Why not give them in the first place? It is important to look after people's rights, but I cannot see the point of an injunction that is unenforceable, which it would be without the powers of arrest.

11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A constituent of mine has come to see me on too many Friday afternoons the worse for drink. He is very good at consuming alcohol and he was eventually thrown out by his girlfriend, so he then claimed that he was homeless. He would wander round to my advice bureau—he was not particularly easy to handle—and on being persuaded to leave me, he would probably go and have a few more drinks. Late at night, he would arrive on the estate and attempt to gain access to his former girlfriend's house. She had an injunction to stop him going there, but the police had to be quick. He would try two or three times, cause a nuisance, and perhaps a neighbour would come out to try to persuade him to leave. He would then continue around the estate trying to find some other people that he used to* know who might take pity on him and let him sleep in their house. Of course, they all knew the nuisance that he was likely to be and often would not let him in. He would then fall asleep somewhere on the estate in one of the communal areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such a case, there is no point in having an injunction against a person coming to the estate unless
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>420</span>
you attach powers of arrest. We want the courts to be speedy, so why waste their time having to have two hearings? Logically, if you have grounds for an injunction, you should attach a power of arrest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There was a flock of "you"s in the hon. Gentleman's remarks; he knows that when he uses the word "you", he is referring to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is another example of the Government talking tough about dealing with people who threaten others in their community, but not being prepared to act. When we suggest sensible amendments, the Under-Secretary shows that he is not really prepared to listen—indeed, I am not sure that he was listening because he ignored the central point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich about discretion still being with the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that a power of arrest must be included with an injunction. First, the person must be in breach of the tenancy conditions—I am talking not about minor, but about serious breaches—and the court has to give an opinion under subsection (6)(a) and (b) about whether the person
	<br><blockquote><p>"has used or threatened violence against a person"</p></blockquote>
and whether
	<br><blockquote><p>"there is a significant risk of harm to that person".</p></blockquote>
Those are two important conditions on which the court has to make a judgment. If they are thought by the court to apply, I do not think that the court should have the discretion to say that having given the right for an injunction—because it felt it was proper to do so—there should not be a power of arrest. As my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish rightly said, if we have reached the serious position of an injunction, why should there be a further delay? If there is a further breach of the tenancy conditions, the authority has to go back to the court for a power of arrest to get something practical done about the problem.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. James Clappison)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for not hearing the middle part of the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point, but why not give the power of arrest in the first place so that we can act without having to go through that additional stage?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. Following the power of arrest, the court will deal with the offence. It is just the way in which the person is brought back before the court. The breach of the injunction has been dealt with in both cases. The hon. Member misses the point. It is the breach of the injunction that is important. It then puts the person who has breached it in jeopardy because

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes my point again. There are two visits to the court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The Minister is a lawyer and obviously there will be a lot of work for them. He is obviously thinking of his future life when he loses his seat at the next election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not understand.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He would be arrested and would have to go back to the courts for a second time. If that is not the case and if there is no point in having the power of arrest, why are we dealing with the clause at all? If there is no point in having the power of arrest attached to an injunction the Government would not be proposing it here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should that power of arrest in the circumstances laid out by the Government be mandatory or discretionary? That is what we are arguing about. The Government say that, in certain circumstances, the courts may attach the power of arrest, presumably because they believe that it is an important tool and weapon to give the courts to reinforce the action that the local authority or others in the case are trying to take. If the Minister does not believe that the power of arrest is important or that it will short circuit proceedings or encourage more effective action, he will presumably vote against the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend ask the Minister to deal with the following situation? My drunk in Stockport is wandering up from the town centre. The council has an injunction preventing him from going on to the Brinnington estate, but does not have the power of arrest. As he wanders up, he is met by a police officer. What does the police officer do after saying "Good evening" to him? If the man is really drunk and incapable he can be arrested, but if, as usual, he is just a drunken nuisance the officer can follow him around all afternoon until he causes a real problem or the policeman must let him go on the estate. The drunk can then be summoned to appear before the courts for breach of the injunction. But surely it would be far more sensible for the police officer to be able to arrest him as he came up on to the estate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend absolutely makes the point. The power of arrest is extremely important in circumstances where immediate action is needed. Clause 118 deals with how the power of arrest might be operated by a constable. As my hon. Friend said, if the power of arrest is not there, the constable cannot do anything. I hope that we have now established that the power of arrest can be a useful means of dealing with a particular problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>422</span>
Our argument is about whether that power should be mandatory for the courts to attach to an injunction in certain circumstances. We are saying that in circumstances such as breaches of tenancy conditions and thereby the court's opinion about the violence or threat of violence and the risk to individuals as set out in subsection (6)(a) and (b) is met, the court "shall" attach a power of arrest to an injunction. That is the point at issue and it is one that the Minister missed and which the Under-Secretary managed to misunderstand completely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are quite clear. We want that because we want tough action. We want to be able to act in the circumstances that my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish graphically described where currently, without the power of arrest, an injunction is virtually worthless. By the time that individual ends up back in court he could be completely sober. No effective action would have been taken to deal with him while he was in his drunken stupor, causing a nuisance and being a potential risk to individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why we shall be tough here and why we want to see action taken. We hope that the Government respond in a similar way. I have heard nothing so far from Ministers that gives any good reason why they should not accept our amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman puts his case a little high, if I may say so. The conclusions that he reached were a result of his doing so and of the fact that he may not entirely understand how the injunction system works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first point that the hon. Gentleman should take on board is that the clause is an important step forward in allowing the courts to attach the power of arrest to an injunction. That is an important power, which the courts will consider using in the circumstances set out in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman seems to believe that the power of arrest may determine how many court appearances there will be. That is not the case. An injunction is imposed with or without a power of arrest. If the person against whom the injunction is made breaches the injunction, he will be brought back before the court, whether or not there is a power of arrest. There is no question of unnecessary court proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hampstead and Highgate)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister fails to acknowledge the gap between the injunction being broken and the offender being returned to court. I refer to a case of domestic violence that occurred in my constituency. Injunctions were imposed. It is true if the man returns to the former domestic home and causes trouble outside, the police can be called and he can be warned. On one occasion, however, he returned, broke into the house and severely injured his former partner. If the power of arrest had existed, that injury to my constituent would not have taken place. That is central to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady, as I am about to turn to the issue of domestic violence. She has given a good example of how the system works. She and the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) would do well to consider the history of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0242">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>423</span>
injunction in cases of domestic violence. Before 1976, it was not possible to obtain an injunction with the power of arrest for offences involving domestic violence. In that year a measure was passed that gave the courts the power to attach the power of arrest to such injunctions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That legislation, passed by a Labour Government, is drafted in the same way as the Government have drafted the clause, and gives the courts the power to make an injunction restraining someone from committing domestic violence, which I am sure hon. Members agree is an extremely serious matter that can cause considerable distress. Under the Domestic Violence and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1976, the courts have powers to make an injunction restraining the other party to the marriage from using violence, restraining the other party from using violence towards a child, and so on. I invite the hon. Member for Attercliffe to listen carefully to the next part of the Act, which states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the judge may, if he is satisfied that the other party has caused actual bodily harm to the applicant or, as the case may be, to the child concerned and considers that he is likely to do so again, attach a power of arrest to the injunction".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman will have heard the word "may"—the same word as is used in the clause. It puts the power into the hands of the court. He, and possibly some of his colleagues, have failed to take on board the fact that this is an important step forward in protecting tenants. It puts the proceedings on the same basis as domestic violence proceedings, which are rightly taken very seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman thinks that because the word "shall" is not used, an injunction will never be made. It is a matter for the courts to decide. Power of arrest can be an important weapon in dealing with breached injunctions, particularly in serious cases, bringing to a rapid end the conduct that is causing the breach. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman wants to explain that a Labour Government got it wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am of the view that legislation can always be improved, which is what we are trying to do. In cases where there is violence or the threat of violence, the court believes that there is a significant risk of harm to a person, and an injunction is granted, is the Under-Secretary content that there should be no power of arrest?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has entirely misunderstood. The clause gives the courts an important power. He does not understand it, which is why he has failed to give it the credit that it deserves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Under-Secretary explain why someone's civil liberties are damaged if there is no automatic power of arrest when an injunction was made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The courts will weight up such matters when they look at the whole picture, including conduct. We can trust the courts to use that important power properly, as the hon. Gentleman will understand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>424</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: However nasty and objectionable people are, it it important to give them rights and to protect those rights. I cannot understand why giving such discretion to the courts makes it nicer for the person on whom the injunction is served. Why is it better for an injunction, rather than an injunction with a power of arrest, to be served? It is not as though someone will serve an extra week in prison because of that; it seems to be simply an administrative matter, which saves a court appearance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary said that, back in 1976 when Labour was in office we proposed such a measure. However, many Conservative Members who were lawyers and were then in Opposition said how terrible it was even to consider including an injunction. The experience of the past 20 years is that it is better to include a power of arrest in injunctions that deal with those who behave violently and irrationally. The only argument for not doing so automatically is that it might be unfair in some way to the person on whom the injunction is served.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand how it could be unfair to serve an injunction, which should be obeyed, that included a power of arrest if it were not obeyed. It would be efficient for the police to administer; there would be no need for two court appearances. The only people to lose out would be the lawyers who would have received payments from legal aid to represent the miscreant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must add a few more words. I am extremely concerned about this matter because of more than one incident within my constituency. The Under-Secretary is being somewhat disingenuous about not only the realities of life for people who have suffered domestic violence but also the pressures on the police in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were a power of arrest with an injunction, the police would not have to weigh up the importance of attending certain scenes, as they do at the moment. I have already cited the example in which a partner in a relationship that had broken down was served an injunction. As I said the possibility of injury to that woman could have been removed if there had been a power of arrest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary does not entirely understand the constant fear in which my constituent lives because of the possiblity of threat from her former partner. She has become used to the verbal abuse directed at her, but she fears physical violence against her, their children and her neighbours. There is no injunction to protect her neighbours, but on occasion, they have been subjected to the ex-partner's reign of terror, and I do not exaggerage when I use that term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power of arrest would remove that threat immediately. There would be no time gap, about which I am concerned, between the possibility of an offence and another offence occurring. As I said, if the police could use such a power, they would not be put in the position of having to say, "We will get there as soon as we can," although they take the complaint seriously. There would be a duty and obligation on them to react. The Under-Secretary should consider more seriously
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0243">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>425</span>
the real effect that the lack of powers for the police under the current law has on the lives of many people. It would be simple to introduce such a measure, and its benefits could be enormous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends have made an extremely powerful case. I am surprised that the Undersecretary is so unwilling to listen to our logical proposal. There are two crucial issues to consider. We must consider whether the courts should have clearer guidance on granting a power of arrest in such cases. My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish has argued with enormous conviction and common sense that it would be sensible to grant a power of arrest in the majority of cases in which such problems arise. All that we come down to is the worry about whether the court will lose its discretion because of the substitution of the word "shall" for the word "may".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As some of my hon. Friends have pointed out, a number of tests would have to be satisfied before the court had to grant the injunction with a power of arrest. The court must be satisfied that the respondent
	<br><blockquote><p>"has used or threatened violence against a person residing, visiting or otherwise engaging in a lawful activity in the vicinity of the premises"</p></blockquote>
and that
	<br><blockquote><p>"there is a significant risk of harm to that person or a person of a similar description if the power of arrest is not attached".</p></blockquote>
Frankly, if the court comes to the view that the respondent has behaved in such a way and that there is a significant risk of harm, what reasonable person would not grant a power of arrest to stop that happening again? I do not understand the Minister's objections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue is whether the injunction with a power of arrest should apply only in the case of a breach of a tenancy agreement, as it does under the Bill as currently drafted, or whether wider circumstances should be explicitly covered. We have argued, with some conviction, that there are circumstances in which a local authority may seek action other than on the ground of a breach of a tenancy agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I specifically described the community and occupation agreements that a number of authorities are entering into in order to try to bolster the confidence of communities and to provide sanctions against people who make life unpleasant for other members of those communities. There can be no commonsense reason for restricting the injunction with a power of arrest only to circumstances in which there is a breach of a tenancy agreement, as the Bill currently does. The amendment would merely make the power more readily available in the wider circumstances that we all know exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's case is absolutely threadbare. While talking tough, they are acting in a way that will make it more difficult for local communities to get redress against the small minority of people who terrorise them and make other people's lives a misery. The Government will inhibit the scope of local authorities, housing associations and other social landlords to take effective action. I cannot understand why. If the Government will not have a change of heart, we must press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We all know that trouble can be caused by people other than tenants. One offensive aspect of part V of the Bill is that it is entitled "Conduct of Tenants". Antisocial behaviour can be perpetrated by owner-occupiers. There are many estates with mixed tenure in which some of the properties were sold under the right-to-buy scheme. In the interests of ensuring that social landlords have powers to take effective action against people causing nuisance when they are not acting solely in a landlord capacity, we want to delete the phrase

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I share the strength of the hon. Gentleman's feeling, there is no necessity to pursue the amendments. His argument contained no compelling logic. As he said, amendments Nos. 313 and 312 want social landlords who apply for an injunction not to be constrained by being able to act against tenants only in their capacity as landlords. I suggest that he is going too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions in clause 116 already enable local authorities in their general capacity to go wider in certain circumstances. After all, they can take out an injunction against anyone under section 222 of the Local Government Act 1972 to protect the interests of people in their area. Such injunctions can also have the power of arrest attached in cases of anti-social behaviour, violence or threats of violence. That has proved to be a useful remedy in several cases and it gives a local authority the ability to prevent anyone,

	<div class='title'>POWER OF ARREST FOR BREACH OF OTHER LOCAL AUTHORITY INJUNCTIONS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 311, in page 65, line 10, leave out "is" and insert "includes provisions".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a modest and technical amendment. It would ensure that local authorities or other social landlords are not constrained by a technical consideration from securing an injunction with a power of arrest. It would change the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"is to restrain any person"</p></blockquote>
from causing a nuisance to
	<br><blockquote><p>"includes provisions to restrain any person".</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to ensure that, when an injunction is granted on wider grounds, the power of arrest is not precluded on a technicality. Local authorities will usually seek injunctions on several grounds with a number of provisions at the same time. We want to ensure that the power of arrest can be attached if the injunctions include the provisions under clause 116, even though the local authority is seeking the injunction on wider grounds than those covered in the clause. It is a technical point, which I hope the Minister will have no difficulty in accepting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess that when I read the amendment, I was not quite clear what the hon. Gentleman had in mind. Clause 116(3) sets out what the injunction is to restrain people from doing. Again, there is nothing to prevent the power of arrest from being attached to an injunction restraining other kinds of behaviour as well as that set out in clause 116. I therefore suggest that amendment No. 311 is unnecessary. However, I take this opportunity to agree with him that it is only right that injunctions designed to stop persistent troublemakers who are not tenants on the estate from making residents' lives a misery should carry a power of arrest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are providing an important new power, and I think that we are as one in ensuring that the courts have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>428</span>
the opportunity to use it. I share the strength of the hon. Gentleman's conviction about the way in which the courts will use it. I simply do not believe that we need to include this unnecessary proposal in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am troubled on this point, because I can envisage circumstances in which a respondent with a clever lawyer will try to argue that because the local authority has sought an injunction on grounds wider than those specified in clause 116, it is not appropriate to grant the power of arrest. As the Bill stands, clause 116(3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The injunction is to restrain any person from—"</p></blockquote>
and then specifies the circumstances that will apply. If the injunction is to restrain the person from doing other things, does not the Minister concede that there might be circumstances in which a clever lawyer, using that technicality, would argue that the court should not grant a power of arrest because that relates specifically to injunctions for the purposes spelt out in subsection (3)? It is a fine legal point, but it troubles me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very substantial new clause and I hope that the Committee will bear with me if I spend a little time outlining its purpose. New clause 10 would put into law a community safety order. The concept of such an order has been widely discussed in recent months following its proposals in a paper published by the shadow Home Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw). That paper highlighted many of the problems encountered by communities faced with anti-social behaviour and suggested the need for new measures to provide confidence to communities and to provide more effective powers for tackling such behaviour.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>431</span>
The community safety order is a form of injunction which can apply to cover the kind of circumstances with which we are all familiar and which have already been discused in Committee. I should like to highlight one or two of the most important features of the community safety order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Orders made under subsection (5) of new clause 10 could restrict respondents from a particular area, require them to remain within a dwelling at certain times or acquire them to enter a particular area only when ecorted. They could also prohibit respondents from approaching a particular person—important where there has been intimidation—or require them not to approach specified premises; and it could prohibit respondents from contacting particular persons or require them not to cause any form of nuisance or annoyance. That wide range of injunctive powers is designed to safeguard communities that may have been intimidated by individuals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What my hon. Friend has said so far is covered by existing legislation. Will he explain to the Committee why he wants to go further?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend will bear with me, I shall go through the entire provisions of the community safety order to show that it is a necessary addition to the powers already available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (7) of new clause 10 provides that, in certain circumstances, a community safety order can be made against a child or young person. It provides that the order may be made against the guidelines of such children or against the children themselves if they are over the age of 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The conditions to be satisfied for the making of a community safety order are important. The individual concerned should have
	<br><blockquote><p>"been guilty of not less than five unlawful acts within an area".</p></blockquote>
We decided on that wording before before we had our interesting debate about the words "vicinity" and "locality". For new clause 10, we chose the word "neighbourhood". If the Minister were to accept the spirit of the new clause, we would happily accept changing the word "neighbourhood" for "locality".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I say, subsection (9) provides that the respondent should have been guilty of
	<br><blockquote><p>"not less than five unlawful acts"</p></blockquote>
within the locality, or had
	<br><blockquote><p>"on not less than five occasions been guilty of damaging property belonging to a qualifying person within an area".</p></blockquote>
The subsection also provides that the respondent should have been guilty
	<br><blockquote><p>"on no less than five occasions of conduct which amounts to an offence under any provision of the Public Order Act".</p></blockquote>
The respondent could, of course, have been guilty of a combination of any of the above. The key point is that it does not apply for occasional offences. An individual who acted irresponsibly only once—perhaps under the influence of drink or because of some other aberration—would not be caught by a community safety order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend confirm that unlawful acts are those acts found to be unlawful by the courts?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>432</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, but I shall deal with that later. Mr. Bennett: Who decides?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend wil bear with me, I shall come to that in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A "qualifying person"—those who can seek a community safety order—is defined in subsection (12). It includes local authorities, housing action trusts, housing associations and other registered social landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish. Subsection (14) provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"A person is guilty of an act if he has committed the act whether or not he has been convicted of that act by a criminal court and proof of that act shall be required on the balance of probabilities."</p></blockquote>
That provision allows people to be called guilty who have terrorised a neighbourhood but who cannot be convicted because witnesses have been intimidated. I shall give an example to show how essential these new powers are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received a letter the day before yesterday from the chief housing officer of the city of Coventry. One estate in that city has suffered a serious problem, caused by a family who are well known to have perpetrated a series of activities. Those activities have made the lives of everyone living in the area an absolute misery. The letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You will be aware of the injunction obtained under S.222 of the Local Government Act, 1972, by Coventry City Council. This injunction excluded two brothers from entering a defined part of an estate in Coventry.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The injunction was obtained in an ex-parte hearing in Chambers last February. Subsequently applications have been made by both defendants to have the Order set aside. The matter was due to come to trial on March 18th.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Very reluctantly, it was decided yesterday"—</p></blockquote>
that would have been the beginning of this week—
	<br><blockquote><p>"on the advice of Counsel, Sir Louis Blom-Cooper, to withdraw from the action. What follows is an explanation of the reasons why this has been necessary.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I am aware of your intentions to try to use the opportunity afforded by the Housing Bill to introduce the concepts of the Community Safety Order. I felt that the details relating to this case may offer some support to your arguments.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Coventry's case is based on a series of affidavits from Council and Police Officers, as well as Members of the City Council, who describe in detail the impact on the estate of the activities perpetrated by the Finnie brothers. In addition, we had persuaded a handful of mainly ex-residents to swear affidavits about their knowledge, and, in some cases, first hand experiences of the Finnies.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Counsel's advice is that this was perfectly adequate to obtain an injunction, where the hearing was ex-parte and in Chambers and none of the evidence was tested.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>At the ex-parte hearing, hearsay evidence was admissible. However, this would not be the case at full trial.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Counsel had hoped that, in the intervening period, it would have been possible to gain more evidence from police records, or from other victims being prepared to speak out. Without victims being identified, our case is weak. Despite exhaustive efforts it has not been possible to persuade more victims to come forward. Hence, the harassment and intimidation which we were trying to tackle, is the very issue which prevents us from moving forward.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Counsel's advice is that the value of the evidence available in a full trial is severely limited. Indeed, it is Counsel's belief that the Court would not be likely to allow the trial to proceed on the basis of the evidence available."</p></blockquote>
The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is clear from our experience that, without the sorts of changes to the law which you propose, it is impossible to achieve any
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0247">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>433</span>
permanent solution to problems of severe intimidation and harassment.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Had we the advantage of not requiring criminal convictions to prove our case, and of not needing to identify witnesses in order to obtain the Order, our evidence would have been sufficient.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>We believe that the confidence of communities would be greatly improved if a "Community Safety Order" (with the distinct advantage of a power of arrest) could be obtained in this way. It may then be easier to persuade witnesses to actually give evidence should the Order be breached and a prison sentence sought."</p></blockquote>
That is a fairly damning indictment of the current position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the contents of that letter and it brings me back to the point that I made earlier. We are hearing about intimidation and the fear of witnesses coming to court, which suppresses the opportunity to pursue cases of harassment and anti-social behaviour. My hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich has reinforced my earlier point, which I hope will be taken seriously by the Minister. I appeal to my colleagues to press it because it is significant and in the interests of good tenants who want a reasonable quality of life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention, which highlights the concern of commodities all over the country about the sort of circumstances that have led Coventry city council to stop taking action against people who are known to be intimidating the community and behaving in a totally anti-social and irresponsible way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening with interest and share the hon. Gentleman's concern about the problems that he has described. I, too, wish to protect tenants on estates. Will he say a little more in the light of the example that he has just given of Coventry and the lessons that he draws from that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do subsections (13) and (14) apply to each of the five unlawful acts—the conditions—that are set out in the new clause referring to the type of offences involved and how they should be proved? Do they also apply to the breach of the community safety order? That is an important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept entirely that the Minister has raised an important point. Subsection (13) of new clause 10 specifies that
	<br><blockquote><p>"An act is unlawful … if it is a crime or a tort."</p></blockquote>
Subsection (14) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A person is guilty of an act if he has committed the act whether or not he has been convicted".</p></blockquote>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>434</span>
does not of itself involve anyone being convicted or imprisoned. It is simply an injunction. The purpose is to enable a court to grant the injunction on the basis of evidence put together by communities that feel they are threatened, where they are not able to demonstrate that someone has been convicted because witness intimidation, as in the Coventry case, has prevented them from getting that conviction. It is not in any way a breach of an individual's civil liberties and I stress that the requirement is that there must be at least five occasions on which any one of these activities has taken place before the conditions for the community safety order are satisfied. Where that applies, it is right for a court to grant the injunction so that if there is a further action by the individual concerned, the power of arrest can come into play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) made a strong case earlier about the importance of preventive action with the power of arrest where communities are being threatened. I should like to highlight the provisions of subsections (18) and (19).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman has just had to deal with an intervention from the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish, but can I take him back to subsections (13) and (14) and the point that I was making about breach? Does the same mechanism, the same standard of proof and the same definition of an unlawful act apply in the event of a breach or not? Breach seems to have been established in the same way as is outlined in subsections (13) and (14) to avoid the sort of problems that this provision is aimed to avoid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come on to that as I was going to give a detailed exposition of the provisions of subsections (18) and (19), which specify exactly those circumstances. The point mat the Under-Secretary made earlier is the perfectly reasonable one about whether each one of these acts has to satisfy the conditions of subsection (9). My understanding of the new clause is that they would. There would have to have been either five unlawful acts within an area, acts involving damage to property within the neighbourhood or conduct amounting to an offence under the Public Order Act 1986 provisions. There would have to be at least five such circumstances to justify the granting of the injunction. I stress again that we are not talking about denying someone's liberty. We are talking solely about providing injunctive powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under subsection (18)
	<br><blockquote><p>"When deciding whether or not to make a community safety order the court shall consider all the circumstances of the case including:
	<ol>
	<li>whether any person or property require the protection of a community safety order to prevent further crime, harassment, intimidation or nuisance</li>
	<li>whether or not there are other powers available to the courts which are reasonably capable of being exercised by which those persons or that property could be protected from such conduct by the respondents".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The court must be satisfied not only that it is necessary to protect a community or person from crime, harassment, intimidation or nuisance, but that no other powers are available which could provide such protection.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>435</span>
Thirdly, the court must consider
	<br><blockquote><p>"the seriousness of the respondent's conduct".</p></blockquote>
If it is trivial, the court will decide that it is not appropriate to grant a community safety order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, the court must take into account
	<br><blockquote><p>"the extent to which persons living in or visiting the neighbourhood have been, or appear likely to have been affected by the respondent's conduct".</p></blockquote>
Where, as in the cases highlighted by my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton, there is considerable evidence of communities being intimidated, the court would find a community safety order applicable, but where the evidence derived from hearsay or malicious rumour, the court would almost certainly reach a view that there was insufficient basis for granting such an order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fifthly—there are five sets of circumstances that must be taken into consideration, but they are not exclusive and others may be considered as well—the court is required to consider
	<br><blockquote><p>"any evidence that persons have been or may have been reluctant to report any unlawful conduct by the respondent or to appear as witnesses in any court … because of a fear of intimidation or harassment."</p></blockquote>
That is the nub of the argument advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton. Where there was intimidation or harassment, the court would be able to take that into account. Where there has not been a criminal conviction, but there are allegations of criminal activity, if the court is of the view that there has been witness intimidation which has affected the prospects of securing a conviction, that might lead the court to the view that a community safety order should be granted. Those are pretty rigorous conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to achieve a balance between the interests of the community and the perpetrators of anti-social behaviour. If there is evidence of no less than five actions by the individual that have caused a nuisance or damage to a community, if it is likely that thre is a further threat to that community if the order is not granted, and if no other sanctions are available to protect the community, the court may grant a community safety order, if it believes that it is reasonable to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the right and proper response to a serious problem. I do not believe, as some hon. Members might, that it errs on the side of giving the courts too great a freedom to grant an injunction which, if breached, might lead someone to lose his or her liberty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There we are, Mr. McWilliam. I cannot follow my original instinct to allow the Committee to get on, as the Under-Secretary has reminded me that I have not reached that stage in my remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (19) states that someone who breaches a community safety order
	<br><blockquote><p>"commits an offence and shall be liable—
	<ol>
	<li>on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both;</li>
	<li>on conviction on indictment to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
Those are serious penalties because, as a consequence of a breach, communities will be left worried—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with all that the hon. Gentleman said about serious circumstances, but what constitutes a breach? Is it a further unlawful act of the type described in subsection (13)? How do the courts prove the unlawful act? What standard of proof is used? What does "breach" amount to?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary came back too soon; I was trying to answer his question. I highlighted earlier what the community safety order might imply. Subsection (5) states what it may require from a respondent. The order may require him to keep out of an area or to go into an area only when accompanied by a specified person. It may prohibit respondents from approaching individuals or specified premises and from contacting specified persons. A breach of one of those conditions would constitute an offence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman now explain the standard of proof and how the breach will be proved to the court?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary is making heavy weather of the matter. When describing the community safety order clause, I specified the conditions that must be satisfied. I explained that the court would need to be satisfied before the order was made, after which time it would specify the order that contained such provisions. If one of the provisions was broken, the court would be required, on the balance of probabilities, to conclude that someone had broken the requirements of the community safety order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing communities that are threatened by anti-social behaviour. For example, in many cases, people have been intimidated by irresponsible elements in the community; witnesses have been intimidated into not giving evidence for fear of their lives and people have had their property damaged. Such behaviour is a cause for concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Burden 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Northfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I right in thinking that such matters were dealt with in the original consultation document issued by the shadow Home Secretary? He made it clear that the issuing of community safety orders would be dealt with under civil procedures and on the balance of probability. A breach of the order would be subject to criminal procedures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend reminds me that I advised the Committee incorrectly when I said that the requirement of proof would be based on the balance of probabilities. That would be so for the granting of a community safety order, but the consultation paper entitled "A Quiet Life" suggested that if the order was breached a higher burden of proof would be required before the person was convicted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am beginning to see the hon. Gentleman's point. To follow it through, is he now telling us, with the assistance of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Burden), that the breaches envisaged in subsection (5) must be proved in a criminal court, using the criminal standard of proof of "beyond reasonable doubt"? Surely such procedures involve witness statements and other proceedings that he described earlier as a problem. His community service order would not, therefore, achieve anything that would avoid the usual court mechanisms, which he has just complained about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must tell the Under-Secretary that the order is a community safety order, not a community service order. Were it breached once it had been granted, the individual concerned would be subject to the power of arrest. That would reassure members of the community that, when the matter went before the court, they had protection and that might encourage them to come forward as witnesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about difficult circumstances; I grant that to the Minister. But we are trying to give embattled communities greater opportunity to take action against the perpetrators of anti-social behaviour who, in many cases, get away scot free because they intimidate witnesses and prevent them from coming forward to testify against them. That is the basis for the community safety order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal has been the subject of detailed consultation since the paper was published last year. The responses were overwhelmingly supportive of the concept, and we want the order to have statutory force. The order is a response to the needs of communities that feel threatened, and I hope that the Minister will not rely on legalistic nitpicking to challenge its basis. It is designed to protect some of the most vulnerable communities, which are suffering standards of behaviour that no Committee member would tolerate in his or her community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Greenwich, and I am grateful to him for outlining so clearly the Labour party's thinking on community safety orders. However, I still have many concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill contains provisions that will assist in dealing with some of the problems that he believes would be alleviated by the community safety order. As the hon. Gentleman said, there is intimidation and there are difficulties in securing conviction. We have heard of such cases this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his closing remarks, the hon. Gentleman said that there had been much consultation on the matter and that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>438</span>
he hoped that we could put his measure on the statute book. I believe that there must be much more consultation before we can put such a measure on the statute book, and I do not believe that it should be included in the Housing Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have great sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's points. We all understand and are concerned about the problems, but the matter is so important that it should be covered by a criminal justice Act. We can examine that when, as I hope, there is a new Government. We must find legislation other than the Housing Bill to make the measure effective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give an assurance that I shall not treat the matter in a legalistic manner. Not being a lawyer, I sometimes think that we should lock all the lawyers up so that they can sort things out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have enormous sympathy with the hon. Member for Greenwich. We have all been given briefs that are not ours and, as we defend them, have had that sinking feeling not only that the arguments do not stand up but that we do not believe in them. As the hon. Gentleman went through his peroration, it became more and more transparent that that was what was happening to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Greenwich is not the Robespierre in the piece. That role is taken by the hon. Member for Blackburn. What our exchanges demonstrated was that my smart lawyer is better than his smart lawyer in the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In talking about briefs that one does not believe in, was the Minister anticipating the brief that he will be given on the provisions dealing with homelessness?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall write that brief for myself, as the hon. Gentleman knows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The one thing that the proposal absolutely guarantees is perpetual work for lawyers. I cannot think of a series of formulations that are more redolent of lawyer's activities. The Labour party's hare-brained scheme would mean that any person living anywhere who had committed five acts of neighbour nuisance would be the subject of a safety order. He would not have to be arrested or convicted; it would merely need to be shown that he had committed those acts
	<br><blockquote><p>"on the balance of probabilities"—</p></blockquote>
by some curious form of transubstantiation, I suppose. The local authority would then consult a high-ranking police officer—the superintendent—so that it could apply to the courts for an order, which could impose a range of restrictions without a time limit. That is illustrated by the famous subsection (14), which probably needs to be set in plainsong. It reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A person is guilty of an act if he has committed the act whether or not he has been convicted of that act by a criminal court and proof of that act shall be required on the balane of probabilities."</p></blockquote>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By the time that people have committed five acts—one assumes that the five with which they have been charged will be only a handful of those that they have committed—they should in any case be within the criminal justice system, with the safeguards and protection of social services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cases would be heard in a county court, but there would be a criminal type of sentence. Presumably the police officer would say, "We're sorry we've missed you on so many occasions, but we can get you by this method if we can't get you by anything else." It may seem a heretical idea from a Conservative, but perhaps some of the children might need help rather than condemnation to house arrest on the basis of its being more likely than not that they have committed the offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mechanism is bureaucractic. To make it work there would have to be five acts, consultation with the police, application to the county court and criminal-type sentences. It mixes the criminal and civil system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Member for Greenwich will accept that the Penal Affairs Consortium and the bodies that it represents would not be the organisations to which I would normally have recourse to plead by case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give the quotation and then I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A letter that I received from the chairman of the Penal Affairs Consortium said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Penal Affairs Consortium—which represents 30 organisations concerned with the penal system—hopes that the Government will resist these new clauses. We set out our views in September 1995 in a response to the Labour party document 'A Quiet Life"'—</p></blockquote>
a title to stir the spirit—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and I enclose a copy of our response."</p></blockquote>
The consortium includes bodies such as the Association of Chief Officers of Probation, the Association of Members of Boards of Visitors, the Howard League for Penal Reform, Justice—which was written separately— and Liberty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are bodies that might not be deemed to have a natural empathy with the Government, but they are urging us to reject the propositions of the hon. member for Greenwich—although in fact they are not his propositions; I do not blame him for them, as he is far too sensible to have come up with such ideas. I blame the hon. Member for Blackburn, who is lurching so far to the right that it is causing terrible difficulties for his own party. I feel the palpable unease of the hon. Member for Greenwich, not merely on the technicalities, but on the principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would a community safety order rank as a conviction? I am indebted to my legal consultant for such questions. The unlawful acts that bring about the making of a community safety order could be criminal offences, breaches of civil law or a combination of criminal and civil matters—which mixes up the two sorts of law. A person could be made to a CSO if a court decided that he was guilty of the act on the balance of probability. People could therefore be subject to such an order and to considerable restriction of liberty even if there was doubt about whether they had actually
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>440</span>
committed the act. That would also apply when the acts were only civil matters such as trespass and nuisance, and fell short of being crimes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary persistently questioned the hon. Member for Greenwich about breach of the order. Presumably the breach would be by a further unlawful act and the person would then be brought before the criminal courts to face trial for what might be only a civil matter—a tortious act. I rehearsed that adjective. Such an act could be traspass on the civil standard of proof, so the jury would be told that if it thought that a person had probably committed the act, it would have to conflict even if there was a chance that he or she might not have done so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister is getting confused about what a breach is. A breach is of the order. It is not a commission of the offence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is not getting confused at all. The only confusing thing is how one can make any sense at all of this curious bouillabaisse of mixed legal spices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Member for Normanton, because he asked me to do so earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what the Minister is saying. He accuses my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich of reading someone else's brief, but he is reading someone else's brief, and it is not making a great deal of sense. We want to try to control the hard core of people on estates—not just council estates but any estates—and to be hard on the criminal and the cause of crime. That is the purpose of new clause 10. The Minister makes light of its proposals to try to protect our estates; what is his alternative? Is it to leave estates as they are? Do the Government propose to do nothing about the problems suffered by people on estates because of a hard core of criminals? We are proposing some protection for those people; what does the Minister propose instead?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am about to tell the hon. Gentleman what we propose. It is not good enough to keep stating the problems and assume that any answer given is relevant. The Committee does not dispute the problem, but we cannot continue merely to make declaratory statements about the problem without devising a system that works and is not so broad and so dangerous—if I may use that word—as to threaten people's civil liberties in the broadest sense. That is at die heart of the argument. The hon. Member for Greenwich used the word "balance"—that was about the only word that he used with which I agreed—and we will use that word constantly in our debate because we all recognise that matters of judgment are involved. How do we deliver protection to one set of people in a way that does not threaten liberties elsewhere? That is the classic dilemma of all legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is concerned about intimidation and things not being done—we are all concerned about that. But even under the procedures in the new clause, witnesses would be required who would be exposed to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0251">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>441</span>
all the same forms of intimidation. The new clause would not solve that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to put two points to the Minister. First, a later amendment deals specifically with the issue of witness protection. Secondly, the point that I made in response to the intervention of the Undersecretary was that, where a community safety order has been granted and breached, the power of arrest will ensure that the person responsible will be arrested pending the case. That will give members of the community a sense of confidence that they can come forward and give evidence without the risk of being intimidated. That is the important power that the new clause would give.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not got it right. My expert is telling me why.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to return to some order, Mr. Me William. The hon. Member for Normanton asked me what we intend to do about the problem. As I said on Tuesday, in my first intervention in this area of debate, we are all trying to find mechanisms that will work—nobody is likely to have arrived at the definitive answer at the first attempt. We have proposed incremental measures in the clause because we will need to see whether they will work and what effect they have. The thrust of the Government's argument is that community safety orders are unnecessary and, in themselves, dangerous. Measures exist to deal with problems in a far less bureaucratic and heavy-handed fashion than is proposed in new clause 10. Serious anti-social behaviour, such as threatening behaviour, assault, robbery, burglary and racial harassment are already offences punishable under criminal law, and if people are caught in the act they are arrested. It is not a case of slapping an order on them until they are caught four more times and arrested for breach of a community safety order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will draw the Minister's attention to the recent report on the Crown Prosecution Service, which expresses great concern at the number of people who have committed offences that appear on the list that he has just given who are not being brought to court, but cautioned and allowed to go free. That is not the way to solve the problems on housing estates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nor is the answer to create an offence of which
	<br><blockquote><p>"A person is guilty … whether or not he"</p></blockquote>
is guilty, which is what subsection (14) of the new clause says. That is what is unsustainable in the argument. As the law stands, if local authorities have evidence or reason to believe that activities even lower down the scale of anti-social behaviour have taken, or will take, place, they can serve an injunction on the perpetrator. One breach, not five, can result in the local authority immediately seeking a warrant for the perpetrator's arrest and all that flows from it. We have debated in detail the new power of arrest under clauses
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>442</span>
115 and 116 in the case of injunctions where there has been violence or the threat of violence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to injunctions. They can be used in some cases. However, is not there a gap in the Bill; it does not provide for an injunction to be served where an owner-occupier—perhaps, someone who has bought a property under a right-to-buy scheme—causes problems for another owner-occupier?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing with the relationship between landlords and tenants. That is the specific purpose of the measure. The hon. Gentleman is trying to introduce issues that go much wider than those with which the Committee is dealing in the specificity of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have dealt with the matter in some detail. Our proposal will be a stronger remedy, which will produce instant results. Under community safety orders the perpetrator would have to be caught misbehaving five times and many offences could have gone undetected in the meantime. If an order were breached, the act would not have to be proved to a criminal standard to convict the perpetrator. Therefore, I see no advantage over existing remedies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall mention some of the other remedies available that deal with the more tangible effects of anti-social behaviour which do not clutter up the statute book with the sort of bureaucratic mess that new clause 10 would create. The police can use powers under the Public Order Act 1986 to punish various sorts of behaviour, from disorderly conduct to riot. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 created the offence of threatening or abusive behaviour with intention to cause harassment, alarm or distress. That offence was designed to deal with racial harassment, but it could be used more generally. So many other remedies are available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I object to the Opposition's proposal because it represents an attempt to convert a declamatory position into a law that would not work, which is inherently dangerous. The proposal is not merely bureaucratic but heavy handed, and its basis is fundamentally unsound—that is, someone can be found guilty of five acts, none of which has to be proved in a court; they merely have to be proved on the balance of probabilities. That is a fundamental and dangerous departure, and I urge the Committee to have nothing to do with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister. The proposal is ill-conceived, and it would not work. I understand why my hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) was tempted along this path. There is a real problem. There is disquiet and unease about the way in which small groups of people terrorise communities. My hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich should have said that the present law can deal with the problem, but that resources to back up the law are lacking. I understand why he' was reluctant to spell out the resources that are needed. If we do not address the problem of resources, we shall simply put in place new laws which will not be implemented. That is the fundamental problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0252">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>443</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind my hon. Friend that it was not a lack of resources that led Coventry city council to withdraw its action against the Finnie brothers. The council employed Sir Louis Blom-Cooper QC. who is not, in my experience, a cheap lawyer. Resources were not the problem. The problem was that the current law did not enable the council to take effective action against those who intimidated witnesses. We are trying to address that issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I disagree with my hon. Friend. I suspect that the first problem is the number of tearaway kids on estates. Too many local authorities are reluctant to take them into care because of the costs involved. We need some fairly drastic solutions. Some children in council and private estates terrorise other people living there. If they get away with it because resources are not available, they become greater and greater nuisances. I believe that we are not putting enough effort into preventing young children getting into continual difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second problem that I want to identify is witness protection. The fabric of our law and order system is witness protection. It is in danger of crumbling unless we can protect witnesses. There was an interesting piece in the 	<i>Manchester Evening News</i> about the horror of the police that a drug dealer in Manchester had a police officer's address. I can understand the concern of the police officer and his family, but too often criminals in Manchester find out the address of witnesses and the police do not have the resources to protect them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the fundamental problem; we have to find the resources to ensure that people will not feel too threatened to appear in court. That happens with misbehaviour of tenants, drug dealing and so on. The more often witnesses are intimidated and too frightened to turn up in court, the more the fabric of law and order will crumble. It is far better to ensure that there are effective witness protection systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be easy for the police to put bleepers into people's homes that could be heard in the local police station so that the police could visit to ensure that they were not being intimidated. However, we all know that there are not sufficient police officers to respond to those alarms. It could also be argued that in many cases the local authority is reluctant to take action earlier because it could end up with far too many cases coming before the courts. Again it is a matter of resources.

If we want to bring peace back into our communities, we have to spend money. There is no simple solution. There is no point in merely changing the law. It would be silly to change from a test required by the criminal courts to one required by the civil courts.

I cite a case to my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich of a lad operating in the Greater Manchester area who was known as the phantom Metro kid because he could only just reach the pedals of the Metro cars that he stole. People were frightened to see the car coming down the road apparently without anybody driving it because he could not be seen at the steering wheel. Although it is an entertaining story, it does not fit in with the clause too well because he is under 10 years of age. Had he driven down five streets, would he have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>444</span>
committed five offences? Would the fact that everyone believed that he was driving the car, count against him?

It will be very difficult to make the provision work. In the end, we have to persuade people that if they want law and order, they must pay for it. If they do not, the law will have to be changed continually and the situation will become worse. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich will not press the new clause because I cannot support him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was greatly disappointed by the Minister's response to the new clause spoken to by my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich. He began by saying that he would not behave like a lawyer but would address the principle of the matter, but then spent his time nitpicking his way through the new clause in a way of which the Under-Secretary would have been proud.

We all accept that such a lengthy new clause may be worthy of further discussion and debate. Part of the reason for our debate this morning is to try to improve what has been suggested, but I did not hear the Minister say what changes the Government might make. The Government have been in power for 17 years, and that enormous problem exists throughout the country. The Minister apparently recognises that the problem exists—I am sure that Conservative Members have experience of it in their constituencies—but he did not say that the Government accept the need to do something. He did not say, "We accept the intent of the Opposition's proposal but we believe that there is a better way of doing it." I would happily give way if the Minister or any other Conservative Member wishes to intervene to make suggestions on how to improve the powers available to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities are trying to control that lawlessness and unrest. People on some estates live in the most desperate circumstances—often poor, vulnerable or elderly people—and they have been exposed to intolerable conditions. The Minister can say only that there are a few problems with the clause and that he does not like it; but what is the Government's alternative? The Minister may say that people will have to wait for five offences to be committed and that they will not be able to act until things get really bad. In reality, those who are harassing the elderly have often committed far more than five offences, and have been guilty of harassment, intimidation and other offences against people who are desperately frightened and who want action to be taken.

My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish said that resources are needed, which I accept, but it is not simply a question of resources. Housing officers, who try to manage such properties, say that they sometimes need extra help from the police. Certainly, Sheffield has diverted time and management resources to deal with such matters. Rent is no longer collected door to door—that time was freed a few years ago to enable management officers to spend more time dealing with other problems, but they often say that they do not have the instruments necessary to deal with the problems. It is not simply a matter of having more housing officers or more police, but of how the problems are dealt with and of having the right solutions.

Such cases of harassment do not always involve only tenants or tenants and owner occupiers. Sometimes problems exist between people who have purchased their council houses. The Bill still has an imbalance. The new clause attempts to resolve that problem, even if it is owner-occupiers or their children who are harassing other owner-occupiers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to injunctions as being a useful way of trying to exert control, but he did not explain that, although the powers in the Bill can restrain council tenants—even against owner-occupiers—owner-occupiers cannot take action against other owner-occupiers or against council tenants. As my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich said, the community safety order is a form of injunction. The Minister may ask what happens if people breach an order. Of course, breaches are serious, but the order would be another weapon for the courts to use to deter people from continuing their actions. Their actions would have been highlighted, the courts would have made an order and restrictions would, one hopes, be a deterrent. That may
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>446</span>
not be true in every case. Some people will continue to misbehave, will breach the order, and will go before the court again. However, such orders will be a means of deterring people from continuing with the sort of behaviour that terrorises people. If the Government do not like our solution, I hope that they will propose one of their own.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman and to the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish. The question before the Committee is that clause 116, as amended, stand part of the Bill. The new clause cannot be voted on now. It will be taken formally when we come to it on the Order Paper and can be voted on separately from clause 116.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
