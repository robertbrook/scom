	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With new clause 52 we come to the low-rent test, which is one of the key obstacles to leaseholders enfranchising under existing arrangements. The low-rent test is defined in section 8 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three separate low-rent tests, the first of which applies to leases that were granted prior to April 1963 when, to qualify on the low-rent test, the ground rent must be less than two thirds of the letting value. The second test applies to properties on which the lease was granted between April 1963 and April 1990. In such cases, the test is that the ground rent must be less than two thirds of the rateable value. The third test applies to post-1990 properties when the ground rent is less than £1,000 in London and £250 elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a series of problems with the arrangements. The figures are arbitrary and, in some respects, capricious. They provide considerable scope for landlord evasion. At present, it is easy for a landlord to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>966</span>
set the ground rent above the threshold to take the properties outside the scope for enfranchisement. Furthermore, there is a problem with properties when the lease was granted before 1963, where extraordinary difficulties arise in defining the letting value at the time and, thus, what two thirds of the letting value should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the debates on the 1993 Act, strong opposition was voiced about the low-rent test, not just from the Opposition but from several Conservative Members, such as the hon. Members for Plymouth, Sutton (Mr. Streeter), for Croydon, Central (Sir P. Beresford), for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) and for Kensington (Mr. Fishburn) who spoke strongly against it. Sadly, they did not join us in the Division Lobby. Hopefully, today, some Conservative Members will put their principles ahead of the party Whip's blandishments and join us on this issue. We must do the right thing and I shall explain why the failure to do so in 1993 led to serious injustices to leaseholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A week ago, I received a letter from a leaseholder living in 68 Cadogan place in London. It states:
	<br><q><p>"I wrote to the Prime Minister in 1992 when his Government's Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Bill was being considered by Parliament. At that time leaseholders such as myself were assured that we would be able to buy our freeholds. This has proved well nigh impossible.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>I acquired my long leasehold house on the Cadogan Estate in 1949. it was requisitioned during the war and was derelict. To restore, improve and maintain it over many years has been a great personal and financial sacrifice, particularly since my husband died.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>The Cadogan Estate refused to renew my lease. Their solicitors wrote it 'would be the appropriate course for them to institute possession proceedings' against me at the end of the lease which would force me out of my only home. They know I have no statutory security of tenure because I'm disadvantaged by London's high rateable values.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>As soon as the Leasehold Reform Bill became law in 1993, I had to exercise the only statutory right open to me by giving notice to my freeholders of my intention to acquire the freehold of my home. They would not admit my claim, obstructing me calculatingly on the sole point that my annual ground rent of £100 was not a low rent. They knew, in the case of leases granted between 1939 and 1963, I would have to prove that the ground rent is not more than two thirds of the letting value at the start of the lease. This has been the most tortuous and time consuming task for me and my experienced advisers.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>I have been forced to go to the County Court on legal aid to establish the letting value. Despite having one of the acknowledged experts in such matters, the Judge completely failed to understand the complexities of how to ascertain the letting value of a lease granted over forty years ago. I now have no other recourse but to seek justice in the Court of Appeal. In a further attempt to obstruct me my freeholders are seeking to raise arguments not previously relied on by them.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>The huge financial costs and the distressing personal effect upon me has severely impaired my health. My lease is a long lease at a low rent. It should fully qualify under the legislation. I am still no nearer achieving my vital legal rights. I most earnestly seek your help that steps will be taken to remove this disastrous anomaly."</p></q>
We could not ask for a clearer illustration of the injustice implicit in the present arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, lest any doubts remain, it was confirmed in a letter to me from an extremely experienced chartered surveyor, Mr. Marr-Johnson, a partner in Marr-Johnson and Stevens. He wrote:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0547">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>967</span>
	<br><q><p>"I am a fellow of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and a partner in Marr-Johnson and Stevens…I have been in practice for 38 years, having trained in estate management with Chesterstons".</p></q>
Mr. Marr-Johnson wrote that throughout his career he has been concerned with valuations and general urban practice, having a large number of extremely well known clients, including most of the big estates. He has an impeccable track record. On the low rent test and the pre-1963 arrangements, he wrote:
	<br><q><p>"I have no hesitation in saying that section 4(1) of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 is extremely difficult to interpret in any particular case. It affects only leases starting before April 1963, so the valuer is put to proof as to the letting value of a property more than 33 years ago. Frequently I find that the County Court has serious problems in understanding the valuation aspects of a case, and more often than not, the matter goes to appeal."</p></q>
Mr. Marr-Johnson cites a series of cases. He concludes that
	<br><q><p>"Although most of these mistakes were put right on appeal, many lessees fall by the wayside. I have just settled two cases where the claims were lodged 18 years ago in February 1978, and the lessees have lived under the threat of Court action and uncertainty throughout the interim…From time to time I am instructed to advise on doubtful cases under section 4(1); only too frequently I am obliged to include words in my report such as 'I am certain that the rent at the start of the lease was indeed low within the meaning of the Act, but I am far from certain that I would be able to prove it in Court.' The section works in a capricious manner, and in my opinion it often does prevent proper claims under the Act from getting through the qualifying process."</p></q>
That is devastating evidence that the current machinery does not work, that it prompts injustice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is there a low-rent test? The only plausible justification is the one argued by the Government in 1993—that the absence of a low-rent test might undermine the rented market by allowing those paying a rack rent a right to enfranchise, but that is not so. Limiting enfranchisement to those with leases of 21 years or more, which is clearly part of the legislation, differentiates leasehold properties from rental properties, and the majority of lettings are now shorthold tenancies lasting for only six months, or other shorter periods. The matter was considered by the Lord Chancellor's Department when it consulted on commonhold in November 1990. The Department took the view, quite rightly, that there was no justification for a low-rent test for commonhold properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, it is an unsatisfactory provision; it has an arbitrary and capricious impact; it is open to abuse; it is used as a device by freeholders to frustrate enfranchisement; it has been rejected by professionals as unworkable; and it was rejected by the Lord Chancellor's Department as unnecesary in respect of commonhold. The proposed change would be a long-overdue remedy for an injustice. It gives me great pleasure to move new clause 52. New clause 53 seeks to change the proportion of a property in non-residential use needed to allow leaseholders to enfranchise. The proportion of the property that is in non-residential usage is currently defined as subject to a maximum of 10 per cent. of the internal floor area.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>968</span>
The new clause will increase that to 25 per cent. There are many leaseholders living in blocks that have shops on the ground floor, and if more than 10 per cent. of the total floor area in non-residential usage, they do not have the right to enfranchise. That 10 per cent. rule can cause a serious injustice to people living in blocks over shops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we debated the matter in 1993, a series of amendments were moved. I tabled an amendment seeking a 50 per cent. limit, in line with the Landlord and Tenant act 1987. The Liberal Democracts spokesman suggested a 25 per cent. limit, and the hon. Member for Kensington (Mr Fishburn)—a Conservative Member—suggested a 20 per cent. limit. We all argued that 10 per cent. was unduly restrictive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government said that they would consider the matter. The then Minister, the right Hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young), undertook to return to the matter on Report. He also argued that the Government already had powers to amend the percentage by regulation. In practice, we had the worst possible outcome. There was no increase in the percentage, and the Government removed their discretion to amend it by regulation. We are stuck with a 10 per cent. limit, which is arbitrary. It does not allow people in blocks of flats the opportunity to enfranchise unless there are, literally, nine storeys above the shops on the ground floor—the 10 per cent.—and there are very few such blocks. That has been highlighted by many bodies—including the Leasehold enfranchisement Advisory Service—as an obstacle to enfranchisement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Ashby 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-West Leicestershire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one of the problems we face is that much of the property above shops is in a very poor state? That is largely because of the 10 per cent. limit—there is no enfranchisement and no incentive to maintain the properties above. A stock of what is essentially good housing is becoming increasingly bad. That is a side effect of the 10 per cent. rule that I do not believe that the Government have appreciated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention; he makes an extremely valid point, with which I entirely concur. The 10 per cent. limit is unduly restrictive. We have reflected on the matter, and we have not pressed for the 50 per cent. limit that we argued for in 1993. We have sought a compromise of 25 per cent., which would bring many more people within the ambit of the legislation without creating a situation whereby residential leaseholders would be able to take over a block that is largely non-residential. The new clause is a compromise, but it would remedy the particular problem that the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (Mr.Ashby) highlighted. I commend both new clauses to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will come as no surprise to the Committee to learn that I fully support both new clauses, for which I shall vote in a Division. The hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0548">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>969</span>
Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford) argued admirably for new clause 52, and it would be of little help to the Committee for me to reiterate those arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Leasehold Reform Act 1967 and the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 were tentative steps towards leasehold enfranchisement. Not only did we dip our toes in the water, but we put our whole foot into the water, and now is the time to embrace leasehold enfranchisement fully. Leasehold enfranchisement is extremely popular across the country, and we would be silly to ignore the wishes and desires of those who have long leaseholds and who want to enfranchise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments for having the low-rent test have, in practice, proved unfounded. The real criterion is the lease itself; it is the crux of the matter. Long leaseholders must have a right to enfranchise, own the freehold and maintain the property as they wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument that rack-rents could be embraced has not proved valid in practice; nor would it be a valid argument. Across the country, landlords are careful to set rents in new leases, just above the level of the low-rent test. Therefore, if we are to keep within the spirit of the 1967 Act and especially the 1993 Act, we should not fear accepting new clause 52; it is the proper way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot think of anything more proper than new clause 53. The hon. Member for Greenwich has limited to seeking a 25 per cent. limit, and I understand why he has done so. After all, we are continually moving forward. I anticipate that, in three year's time, we might move from 25 per cent. to 50 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are those sitting behind me who thought that it was a load of nonsense when I intervened to say that a substantial number of properties were being neglected because the main interest was in the shops themselves, not the accommodation above them. One has only to drive along a street to find that what I say is manifestly true. I suggest that those who disagree with me drive along York road, look at all the properties above the shops there and then try to suggest that I am being idiotic and stupid and that what I say is untrue. They have only to look at the outside of such properties to know that that is fact. They would do well to drive along Fulham high street and take a look at the large block of flats owned by someone who was a very good friend of mine whose interest was largely in the antiques shop there, which is doing well. Several people who knew my friend well had to persuade him to do some work on those flats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To some extent, such matters will be dealt with under the bill because tenants can ask for management and so on, but if leaseholders take that course—which I applaud; I am delighted that it is in the Bill—they will want to go one step further into enfranchisement. They should have that right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received many letters and much support on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>970</span>
this matter. It is the overwhelming wish of leaseholders that we should go down this path. I shall vote to do so, and I beg my right hon. and hon. Friends in Government to consider the matter fully and accept the new clause, or, at least, undertake to table amendments on Report that deal adequately with such matters. The new clause represents a good proportion, which is not party political. All we are trying to do is get things right for leaseholders. I shall certainly support the new clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Diana Maddock 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support the new clauses. In the past, hon. Members from both sides of the House have attempted to introduce so-called low-rent amendments. Liberal Democrats in the House and in the other place have supported such amendments, and I pay particular tribute to one of my colleagues in the House of Lords who attempted to increase the level from 10 per cent. to 25 per cent. during consideration of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Greenwich pointed out, a very high figure was suggested last time, and most people agree that the sensible thing to do would be to unite behind a figure of 25 per cent. I hope that the Government will consider what has happened between 1993 and now and recognise the good sense in these new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire gave compelling reasons for supporting the new clauses by pointing to the state of some existing properties. If we wish to do something about them, there is a simple remedy. I hope that the Under-Secretary will accept that remedy this morning. As the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire said, if the Under-Secretary is no happy with the new clauses, he should table his own on Report. It is high time that something was done. Most people agree with the remedy. I look forward to hearing a positive response from the Under-Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. James Clappison)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. member for Greenwich rightly said, these proposals were considered during the passage of the 1993 Act. It is important that the Committee should recall that the 1993 Act represented a considerable step forward for leaseholders by granting the right of enfranchisement. The Committee should also bear in mind that the right to enfranchisement involves compelling a freeholder to sell property. Therefore, at the time of the 1993 Act, it was felt that that right should be guided by principle and by striking the appropriate balance where necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the detail of the new clauses, and that should assist the Committee. There are two tests to establish whether a flat owner can be regarded as an "owner occupier". First, there should be a long-term interest—that is more than 21 years—and, secondly, the leaseholder should pay only a nominal rent. Hence the low-rent test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>971</span>
The comparison of the annual ground rent to the rateable value is a simple test to distinguish between renting tenancies and "ownership" tenancies. As the hon. Member for Greenwich is no doubt aware, that test has a respectable history. It appears in roughly the same form in several pieces of important landlord and tenant legislation, including the Landlord and Tennant Act 1954, the Leasehold Reform Act 1967, which included a low-rent test that was the precedent for the 1993 Act, and the Rent Act 1977. It is, therefore, an established test, which has had an impact on the residential property market. It should not be changed lightly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1993 Act also amended the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 to give leaseholders in houses the choice between the original low rent test and the test for flats. The alternative test takes into account ground rent during the first year of the lease and widens the scope for enfranchisement to those in houses with rent review clauses. Therefore, the 1993 Act materially improved upon the provisions in the 1967 Act for the application of the low-rent test on those owning homes under a lease.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend tell me the purpose of including in the 1993 Act the provision for the low-rent test taking into account ground rent during the first year? What was the purpose of that other than to enfranchise those affected?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The 1967 Act, upon which the 1993 Act improved, was designed to assist homeowners with leases. They were subject to a test that may have involved considering the outcome of rent review clauses and increases in rent. That may have taken them outside the scope of enfranchisement according to the low-rent test as it was originally envisaged in the 1967 Act. The 1993 Act took the low-rent test back to the rent in the first year of the original lease, making it two thirds of the rateable value. That assisted may homeowners who would otherwise have been excluded by the provisions of the 1967 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The relief is the same as for 1967 home owners. I do not know whether my hon. Friend for North-West Leicestershire heard the description given by the hon. Member for Greenwich: if he did, he will be aware that 1967 home owners would be governed by the provisions the hon. Gentleman described. In the cases about which we are talking, their low-rent tests would apply to two thirds of the rateable value at the time the lease was granted, which represented a material improvement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>972</span>
approaching his point in a balanced, principled way and within the spirit of much preceding legislation, which I have described. There is a long history, going back through legislation passed by Governments of both parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard detailed arguments, which I shall deal with as briefly as I can. The argument has been put many times—the hon. Member for Greenwich put it again—that if a qualifying tenant is a long leaseholder, that is a sufficient test of ownership. But leases that are not at a low rent are, by definition, renting leases—that is, they are at a full, open market rent—and will fall within the Rent and Housing Acts unless the property has a rateable value or a rent in excess of the prescribed limits. The low-rent test therefore provides a dividing line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the low-rent test provides an important distinction between the rental and long lease markets and marks the extent of the transfer of equity between landlord and tenant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Under-Secretary accept that when the 1954 and 1967 Acts were passed the large majority of private rentals were on controlled or regulated tenancies? Landlords quite often had a direct incentive to evade the Rent Acts by establishing long leases at rack rents. That is no longer so. As I have made clear, the vast majority of rentals are now on shorthold tenancies with periods of six months or a year. It simply is not true that we are in a position analogous to those that applied when the low-rent test was introduced in 1954 and in 1967. The position is quite different, and that should be reflected in legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The need for a dividing line still exists. I note the hon. Gentleman's point, but I believe that that line is of value in marking the division between the two interests involved, which is determined by the extent of the transfer equity between landlord and tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that that distinction is still of value and that there is still value in the low-rent test. I must resist the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 53 would raise from 10 to 25 per cent. the percentage that excludes from enfranchisement those premises that contain more than a specified amount of non-residential use, such as commercial use. The new clause would enable premises where up to a quarter of the internal floor area was used for non-residential purposes to become enfranchiseable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 10 per cent. non-residential threshold was chosen carefully after we took extensive soundings and expert advice. There is no demand in the commercial property market for leaseholders of commercial units to have the right to purchase the freehold. Anything that undermines the generally satisfactory working of the commercial property market and the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 would have an unsettling effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In setting the dividing line at 10 per cent. of floor area, we tried to ensure that enfranchisement affects only properties in which commercial use is very much
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0550">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>973</span>
ancillary to residential use. The 1993 Act applies only to properties that are predominantly residential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware of the concerns of tenants who live in mixed use properties that are excluded from enfranchisement, many argue for the 10 per cent. threshold to be increased. On the other hand, many landlords argue that the 10 per cent. threshold is too high. Landlords consider that 10 per cent. is as far as we should go and that that should be measured by value, not internal floor area. That might exclude even more leaseholders from enfranchisement, but the reasoning is that the commercial element of the property may form the greater part of the total value of the freehold interest. We believe that there is a question of balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Care was taken at the time of the 1993 Act to get the balance right. On the basis of what I have heard this morning, I am not persuaded that the balance is wrong. I must therefore try to persuade the Committee to resist that new clause as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am far from convinced by the Minister's comments, I shall not draw out the debate, as the issues have been aired already. His argument in favour of the retention of the low-rent test was blown to pieces by the Lord Chancellor's Department, which considered the need for it in relation to commonhold and rejected it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the 10 per cent. threshold, I remind the Minister that his Government's 1987 Act provided a 50 per cent. threshold. We are offering a compromise. The current provisions are restrictive, unfair, capricious and would result in injustices to individuals. If enfranchisement is to become a reality, I urge my hon. Friends and colleagues—I warmly welcome the hon. Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Walker) who is with us today—to vote in favour of new clauses 52 and 53.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Brooke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of London and Westminster, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was absent last Thursday morning, at the end of the Tuesday afternoon sitting, the hon. Member for Greenwich and my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire had, in an attack on the leasehold principle, advanced what seemed to be a proto-Marxist conspiracy theory about the past 300 years. I attempted to intervene in the speeches of both of them to draw attention to the architectural contribution that had been made by the great estates through the leasehold principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise the matter again because, during my absence on Thursday morning, the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson) thought that I made those interventions as a defence of the current application of the principle. The purpose of my interventions was to point out that the leasehold principle had made a considerable contribution to our urban evolution in this land in a manner that was distinctive from the other countries in Europe to which the hon. Member for Greenwich referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>974</span>
My constituency has historically been divided between the City and Westminster. The City was always the private area; Westminster was always the seat of government and the public area. The first use of the leasehold principle in terms of urban evolution occurred in Bloomsbury square in the early 17th century. Leasehold is often thought of as being an 18th century device, because of the beauty of the Georgian squares, but Lord Southampton's development at Bloomsbury square was a genuine example of large-scale town planning, with residential and all the other facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The great plague and the great fire of London in the City of London drove the residential population westwards. The west end developed remarkably in the latter part of the 17th century and in the 18th century. The phenomenon is not confined to London, for Bath, which is a world heritage site, also owes a tremendous debt to the leasehold principle and its effect. Just as Bloomsbury square was the first square in London in the early 17th century, the Crescent was re-introduced by the Wood father and son in Bath as an architectural concept for the first time since the Romans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The leasehold principle has conferred a great architectural and urban benefit on our land. I recognise from the legislation that has been enacted since 1967 that it does not necessarily immediately fit the present circumstances. Like the hon. Member for Greenwich, I offer an anecdote to substantiate that. Yesterday, I lunched with a constituent who is a former company secretary. He lives in a block of 12 flats where there is a willing purchaser and a willing vendor. Yet the residents are finding it astonishingly difficult to negotiate under the existing legislation, because of the difficulty of reconciling the conflicting valuations. I freely recognise how much more difficult the situation would be if there were an unwilling vendor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system has past virtues. Of course I agree with my hon. Friend the Minister that landlords have rights. I have argued that for 19 years in my constituency. I recognise that there will have to be patient unravelling to ensure that a device which has served us remarkably will historically is suitable for present circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence that past legislation has not worked as effectively as its sponsors hope has been made clear by the hon. Member for Greenwich. I do not disagree with him. My hon. Friend Under-Secretary makes perfectly reasonable claims about the 1993 Act, but he must also face the statistics that have emerged since it was passed. To be totally even-handed, the hon. Member for Greenwich must acknowledge that the Leasehold Reform Act 1967, which he seeks to amend, and to which he earlier claimed that merit attached, also has demonstrable deficiencies. Mr. Marr-Johnson, to whom the hon. Gentleman referred, is well-known to me in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The net effect is that, while I shall be loyal to the Government in Committee, I hope that by Report they will have further considered a number of issues, for we should not miss the opportunity for patient unravelling that the Bill represents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We come to three new clauses, all of which would ease the process of enfranchisement and help to ensure that leaseholders could take up the rights that Parliament intended to give them in 1993.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 54 would remove the statutory requirement that leaseholders obtain a preliminary valuation before commencing enfranchisement procedures. Section 13 of the 1993 Act provides that leaseholders must obtain such a preliminary valuation from one of a range of qualified people before starting enfranchisement. The thinking behind that requirement was that before leaseholders incurred costs, they needed to know what they were letting themselves in for. That sounds perfectly reasonably on the face of it, but in practice a series of problems have arisen. The cost of preliminary valuations is often onerous, and creates an impediment to enfranchisement. A fairly standard charge for such an obligatory valuation is £250 per flat, and the sum can rise to as much as £400 per flat. In practice, preliminary valuations seldom relate to subsequent conclusions about valuation. The figures that they produce are virtually never the basis of negotiations [	<i>Interruption</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have got a bit restive this morning, have we not? I should like to hear the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. We are all restive this morning, with good reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, preliminary valuations are rarely relevant to subsequent negotiations and the outcome. The valuer concerned is often not the one who subsequently acts as the expert witness for the leaseholders if the matter goes to a tribunal hearing. The statutory obligation to obtain the preliminary valuation at significant cost tends to undermine leaseholders' confidence in their ability to understand what is usually a perfectly straightforward matter. The mystique that the valuers take on is not helpful to the leaseholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Supposedly, the initial valuation is intended to obtain an estimate of the correct price for the freehold. That is worked out primarily on the basis of verified
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0552">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>977</span>
sales of comparable properties in the immediate neighbourhood. A leaseholder could easily manage to set out the figures in a recognised way. In many cases manuals could be obtained from bookshops. [	<i>Interruption</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. My remarks applied also the hon. Members for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) and for Belfast, North.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Leaseholders can seek guidance from manuals or can obtain advice from the excellent Leasehold Enfranchisement Advisory Service. A study of previous tribunal decisions also makes the proper approach to the process very clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no justification for forcing tenants to pay significant sums of money for information that they could obtain themselves for nothing or next to nothing. The current arrangements are widely viewed as unnecessary and unhelpful. It is significant that the provision does not apply to holders of leases on houses who want to enfranchise under the Leasehold Reform Act 1967, or to flatholders who want a lease extension under the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993. The provision only applies to enfranchisement. It is an unhelpful anomaly and deters some leaseholders from proceeding. We therefore intend to remove it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 55 is designed to ensure that a freeholder's wish to take forfeiture proceedings against a leaseholder is not allowed to stand in the way of enfranchisement. The current provision prevents a leaseholder from trying to enfranchise other than by special leave of a court, if the landlord has initiated forfeiture proceedings. That provides a perfect opportunity for the more unscrupulous landlords, some of whom we have heard much about in Committee, to initiate forfeiture proceedings to frustrate the wishes of leaseholders who want to enfranchise. Sadly, as we know all too well, such intimidatory tactics can easily work against leaseholders. The purpose of the amendment is to reduce the scope for such deterrence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would leave intact paragraph 3(1) in schedule 3 to the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, which debars from enfranchisement a leaseholder who is subject to forfeiture as an outcome of court proceedings. It is perfectly proper that people in such circumstances should not be entitled to enfranchise. However, the new clause would remove sub paragraphs (2) and (3) of paragraph 3 which deal with circumstances in which forfeiture proceedings have been begun, but nothing has been confirmed in court. The new clause would revise sub-paragraph (4) to accommodate that change, but would leave in force the provisions in the sub-paragraph that allow a leaseholder to enfranchise if a court has decided that it is reasonable. That concept would be applied to all cases in which the matter had not come to court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reform is a sensible one to close a loophole that currently allows unscrupulous freeholders to frustrate
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>978</span>
leaseholders' wishes. I hope that the Committee will agree to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 56 is designed to ensure that all eligible leaseholders are entitled to participate in enfranchisement proceedings. It has been prepared in response to a problem identified by the Leasehold Enfranchisement Advisory Service in its interim report published just over a year ago. On page 10, the report states that
	<br><q><p>"there is no right of participation in collective enfranchisement action and a majority group can choose to exclude other individuals or minority groups. There is evidence of such exclusions occurring in actions and there are obvious implications here for racism. There could be benefit in providing a right of participation or the removal of the requirement for unanimity of participants in cases of requests from non-participants to join the action."</p></q>
We believe that the case for reform is strong. We accept the argument that there should be a right to participation set out by the Leasehold Enfranchisement Advisory Service, which is precisely what the amendment would achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should say a word about the Leasehold Enfranchisement Advisory Service. It was set up after the 1993 Act in recognition of the need for expert advice for leaseholders. It has been funded in part by the Department of the Environment and in part by the Council of Mortgage Lenders. It has a small staff, headed by Peter Haler, and I am pleased to see him the Committee today. It has been doing excellent work, advising a large number of leaseholders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I sincerely hope that Mr. Haler is not in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. McWilliam. I should have said that Mr. Haler is listening to the proceedings of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The advisory service has dealt with a substantial number of inquiries. When taking account of the number of leasehold flats in the blocks concerned, it estimated that its advice in its first year of operation affected about 66,000 leaseholders, which is 9 per cent. of all leaseholders in flats eligible for enfranchisement, according to the Government's estimates. Not only does the service advise leaseholders, but it identifies problems, a number of which we have discussed this morning. It has been doing extremely valuable work and we all owe it a debt of gratitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It faces two problems, however; the first is the growing demand for advice on related leasehold issues, other than enfranchisement, such as service charges and forfeiture actions, which are increasing. Under its current remit, the service is not authorised to deal with such matters. Secondly, it is faced with the threat of the loss of its income, and therefore with closure, at the end of the year. It really would be a disaster if that happened because there is no other specialist body with such expertise. I think that all members of the Committee recognise that the matter is highly complex and difficult, which requires expertise to understand it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0553">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>979</span>
fully. It would be utterly wrong for the advisory service to be forced to close at a time when its services are likely to be under exceptionally heavy pressure resulting from the new measures contained in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will give sympathetic consideration to the case for continuing to fund the Leasehold Enfranchisement Advisory Service and, indeed, to widening its remit. I hope, too, that he will accept the three new clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The preliminary valuation is clearly otiose, bureaucratic and costly. We want to reduce the burden on people, including landlords. When you have a good landlord—the sort of landlord that my right hon. Friend the Member for City of London and Westminster, South (Mr. Brooke) would encounter—he will say that the law is the law and the principle is that I have to allow you to purchase the freehold, but the remaining question is one of cost, so I advise you to get a reputable—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I already own my freehold.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying what the landlord—not you, Mr. McWilliam—would say. He would say to the tenant, "I advise you to get a reputable surveyor to value it. I will do the same and if they cannot agree and the figures are disparate we shall put both of them together in a room and lock them in without food or water until they come out with a figure that both of use agree on." A reputable landlord would do that. He would not want to go to a Lands Tribunal and put everyone, including the tenant, at expense. Professional advice is needed at that stage: a preliminary valuation is bureaucratic and unnecessary because in practice it is never used again, so is of no value whatever. It is also costly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the universal, pragmatic experience of those who have gone down this path. I realise that it may have been introduced in 1993 because it was thought that people might apply for too expensive a freehold and waste everyone's time. That is not happening, but it is costing people money, for nothing. The new clause is good and practical, and has arisen from knowledge and practice in the past few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clauses 55 and 56 have much merit. I am confident that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will appreciate that and agree that they accord entirely with Government policy, practice and intent. I hope that he will undertake to come back on Report with amendments to help what are obvious loopholes in the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>980</span>
At present, we are having a slight philosophical difference because the Bill amends existing Acts to try to make them work more satisfactorily. I applaud the Government for that. However, I feel that this is a wonderful opportunity to improve legislation. The new clauses would achieve that, which is entirely in accordance with the Bill's philosophy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse what was said by the hon. Member for Greenwich and by my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire about the Leasehold Enfranchisement Advisory Service. As the hon. Member for Greenwich said, it was set up in the aftermath of the 1993 Act and funded partly by the Department of the Environment; at present, it is also funded by the Council of Mortgage Lenders and the Building Societies Association, both of whom are my constituents. I am in favour of the service on behalf of many of my other constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I declare a minor and marginal interest in that I am about to undertake a task for the council and the association which, when they invited me to do this, made it clear that they would not ask me to take a parliamentary role on their behalf. I speak purely as their Member of Parliament and on behalf of those who use their services. Because of the quality of the service and its assistance in lubricating the working of the 1993 Act, I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will be sympathetic to the plea that has been made to him and, considering the nature of the outlay, I trust that the Department of the Environment will be generous in funding the service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I add my support to new clause 54 and pay tribute to the work of the Leasehold Enfranchisement Advisory Service that has been so applauded. It must be clear to the Minister that there is cross-party support for dealing now with something that was not dealt with properly in 1993. He has the opportunity today to put that right. I hope, therefore, that he will take note of the views of those more experienced in the matter than I. The problems of leasehold have been considered on and off for a number of years. We have been well briefed by those who want real change; their plea is that we should get it right this time.

The hon. Member for Greenwich has been involved in housing matters for some years. He, the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire, and the right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South have all brought their expertise to bear. All members of the Committee have been lobbied by those who have tried to advise people on such matters. I hope that the Minister will see fit to accept what is proposed today—or, at least, to ensure that the mater will be dealt with satisfactorily, once and for all, on Report. Many people have suffered an awful lot in trying to deal with what can be described only as a nightmare of legislation. Will the Minister please give them sweet dreams?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be appropriate, Mr McWilliam, if I deal with each of the new clauses in turn.

New clause 54 seeks to remove the requirement for formal valuation by a qualified surveyor and the other parts of section 13 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 that follow from it. The intention behind that provision was good. The requirement was intended to ensure that leaseholders would receive professional advice on the likely cost should they choose to proceed with enfranchisement. Once the initial notice has been issued, the leaseholders can become liable for the landlord's cost, even though they may not complete the enfranchising process. The clause was meant to be a safeguard for tenants seeking enfranchisement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened carefully to the arguments made by the hon. Member for Greenwich and the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for North West, Leicestershire arising from his experience. It is not my intention to keep in place an unnecessary obstacle to enfranchisement that is not justified by principle and which may result in unnecessary cost. I am prepared to reflect upon the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cirencester and Tewkesbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that new clause 54 could add to the bureaucracy of the enfranchisement procedure? The notice to enfranchise is a serious commercial step. Those who wish to enfranchise will have to pay a serious amount of money for the unexpired proportion of their lease. It is surely sensible that they should have to obtain a professional valuation, so that they know the magnitude of that step and how much money they are likely to have to pay before they issue a notice and incur costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has underlined the point. In seeking to respond to the debate, I shall consider the need to bear in mind what he said. I want to reflect on the matter and to balance the two considerations. I know that my hon. Friend speaks from experience, but I want to respond to both points of view, so I cannot make any firm promises. I shall seek to avoid unnecessary complications, but keep in place valuable safeguards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Under-Secretary at least be generous enough to reassure the Committee by accepting new clause 54, and making further amendments on Report if necessary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point, but it might preempt the sort of consideration that I wish to make. I should prefer to reflect on the matter without being fettered by the new clause being part of the Bill. I have said that I shall reflect carefully on the matter. The hon. Gentleman will appreciate the complicated factors on both sides, with experience pointing in both directions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sadly, I am somewhat of a cynic. Noting that the Minister does not have a majority this morning, I can see that it is a good idea for him to offer
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>982</span>
to consider the matter further. When the majority is rolled out on the Floor of the House, however, he will take no notice, so we need more evidence of good intent before we can offer to withdraw the new clause. Otherwise, I shall press my hon. Friends cynically to press it to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to approach the matter in an open-minded way, taking into account all relevant experience, so that we can get it right. It is an important issue. I do not want leaseholders to have to be responsible for unnecessary costs, but, as the hon. Gentleman will accept—he has listened to the debate carefully—it is an important step for leaseholders. As my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury rightly said, leaseholders may incur considerable expenses further on, and that consideration also has force. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will reflect on the debate, and realise that I am genuine when I say that I want to balance considerations. I hop, too, that I can cure him of his cynicism, but I am not convinced of the merits of the new clause. I see that the hon. Member for Greenwich is looking somewhat agitated, so I shall give way to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was just wondering whether the Minister would say something about the fact that the provision is not required for leaseholders in houses. If it is not necessary for a leaseholder in a house to seek a prior valuation, why should it be necessary for a leaseholder in a flat to do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to consider that, but the instant response that comes to mind is that, as the hon. Gentleman will be aware, the costs to leaseholders in flats—depending on how many flats are involved—may be considerable more than those in the case of a single house. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will bear that important fact in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not convinced by the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Greenwich on new clause 55. I agree that we should remove ways in which rogue landlords can frustrate the wishes of tenants and leaseholders, particularly the wish to enfranchise—we have already heard about the use of forfeiture as an intimidatory tactic. However, I was not entirely convinced by the way in which the hon. Gentleman dealt with existing provisions under paragraph (3) of schedule 3 the Leasehold Reform Act 1993. The hon. Gentleman referred to leaseholders having to obtain leave of the court when forfeiture proceedings have been initiated. The hon. Gentleman will see that paragraph (3) of schedule 3 states:
	<br><q><p>"Leave shall only be granted under sub-paragraph (2) if the court is satisfied that the tenant does not wish to participate in the giving of such a notice of claim solely or mainly for the purpose of avoiding the consequences of the breach of the terms of his lease in respect of which proceedings are pending."</p></q>
Looking at that, I do not think it right that a tenant should seek enfranchisement solely or mainly for the purpose of avoiding the consequences of a breach of the terms of the lease.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman or my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire intervene, I should say that one can trust the court to examine the circumstances of the case and determine whether the tenant is being obstructed by a landlord in a genuine attempt at enfranchisement, or whether the tenant is seeking enfranchisement with a view to avoiding the consequence of forfeiture. I believe that we can trust the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept entirely what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary says. We are trying to achieve fairness, and we must not assist tenants who are trying to escape the consequences of their own actions. Will my hon. Friend accept that the desire for enfranchisement is often triggered by a series of events—there may be a number of small events—culminating in the tenants saying, "We have had enough"? They find that they are faced with an intransigent and difficult landlord—there are often rogue landlords in such cases. Tenants will say, "We shall not pay the service charge, which is unmerited." The charge may be 50 per cent. above what the insurance rate should be. In my case, it was 100 per cent, above that. I withheld the insurance payment for six months. However, I gave way eventually because there was no future in it for me; we might have gone into forfeiture. Such matters might be triggered by the same events. Therefore, if my hon. Friend reconsiders the matter, he might find a proposal that deals with both the situation that I have mentioned and that which he has mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That intervention was a little long. I remind hon. Members that they are perfectly entitled to try to catch my eye for a second or even third time during a debate. The procedure is not the same as that on the Floor of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure my hon. Friend that I approached this matter in the way that he suggested—I considered the appropriateness of the formula. When I saw the formula in schedule 3(3) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, I thought it superior to that in the new clause, which would introduce blanket permission for tenants to seek enfranchisement regardless of their motivation. I ask my hon. Friend carefully to consider the terms of the new clause because it seems tailor-made for those leaseholders who seek to avoid the consequences of forfeiture. The proposal places no obstacle in the way of someone who is genuinely interested in enfranchisement and who has the general background reasons for wanting enfranchisement which have been described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary cannot have been listening to the point that I made when I moved the new clause. I stressed specifically that the new clause would preserve paragraph 3(1) of the schedule, which prevents a leaseholders from enfranchising
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>984</span>
where a court has granted an order. We accept that such matters must go to court. If a court were to decide that a leaseholder was simply using the new clause to remove the threat of forfeiture, it would grant an order against the leaseholder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to amend the existing procedure, which requires that every case go to court, even where unscrupulous landlords have used the threat of forfeiture to prevent leaseholders from enfranchising. The new clause represents a fair balance. It would allow courts to make judgements on such cases. It would stop leaseholders such as those of Mr. Bebington being prevented from enfranchising simply because their landlords had begun forfeiture proceedings against them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraphs (2) and (3) of schedule 3 to the 1993 Act deal with different cases. Rather than introducing the blanket permission that the hon. Gentleman seeks, one should trust the courts to decide the real reason for tenants seeking to enfranchise. Paragraphs 3(2) and 3(3) serve a useful purpose; they discriminate appropriately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 56 would give every qualifying tenant the right to participate in the enfranchisement process. I accept the underlying principles of new clause 56 that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. However, new clause 56 would not deliver anything worth while; it would give leaseholders the right to put their names to the initial notice served on landlords under section 13 of the 1993 Act. It would not confer a right to take part in the future management of a block or related financial matters. It says nothing about how to reach agreement on such matters. New clause 56 is not entirely what it seems to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To secure an effective right for every tenant to participate on reasonable terms would require something much more complicated. That is the problem with new clause 56. Such matters are not dealt with in existing legislation because we wish to keep enfranchisement procedures as simple as possible, and I am sure that the Committee shares that wish. If we were to add provisions governing tenants' participation agreements, we would add further complexity and, inevitably, less flexibility in the way leaseholders could prepare their bids. That is why the only legislative requirement at present is simply that at least two thirds of the qualifying tenants must sign the initial notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If leaseholders fall out among themselves, some might seek to exclude others from joining the enfranchisement process. It is commonsense that, in the vast majority of cases, leaseholders will get together and plan their bid for enfranchisement sensibly and fairly. Obviously, it is in their financial interests to spread the costs as widely as possible. There are clear financial benefits in letting others who do not participate in the initial process join the managing company at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are considerable difficulties with the proposal. I emphasise that wider and more technical
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0556">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>985</span>
considerations may arise as a result of the new clause. I am prepared to reflect upon it because I can see the underlying principle outlined by the hon. Member for Greenwich. I want to consider the evidence on how great the problem is, but I shall also bear in mind the need to avoid unnecessary complexity and to keep the provisions as simple as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall reflect on the new clauses, but I cannot accept them as they stand. I warn the Committee that they may involve considerable complexity and the need to avoid undesirable complexity will be very much in my mind when I consider them. I do not promise that there will be any changes, but I shall reflect on the new clauses. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider withdrawing the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary's undertaking to reflect upon the new clauses is entirely consistent with the spirit in which he has participated in our proceedings. I certainly accept those undertakings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have three new clauses before us, and the Under-Secretary has offered to reflect on two, but has rejected the third.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the new clauses in turn. New clause 54 is designed to ensure that there is no requirement to have an initial survey carried out. The Minister offered to reflect on that, but I am slightly troubled because I recall the debates in 1993 when the then Minister for Housing, Inner Cities and Construction, now the Secretary of State for Transport, offered to reflect on the 10 per cent. rule. On that occasion, we did not receive anything on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that in this case the reflection will be more positive and committed and that we shall see measures to overcome the serious and real problem facing leaseholders who are put to considerable additional costs if they live in flats. People do not face such costs if they live in houses. There is an anomaly that should be removed. After reflecting, I hope that the Under-Secretary will decide that the problem should be remedied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On new clause 55, the matters would be for a court to decide, but there would not be a requirement to go to court as soon as the landlord took out forfeiture proceedings. As the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire rightly pointed out, many cases of enfranchisement will be triggered by capricious or unscrupulous activity by freeholders seeking to intimidate their leaseholders. The threat of forfeiture is one of their weapons. In many cases, the threat of forfeiture could be used as a mechanism for stopping enfranchisement. That would place an extra cost on the leaseholder because he would have to go to court to have that threat put aside. The new clause was designed to short-circuit that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary agreed to reflect on new clause 56, but said that the issue was more complicated than the new clause recognised. We accept that there is probably a need for subsequent amendments to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>986</span>
legislation, but the principle that people should not be debarred from enfranchisement—one group of leaseholders should not be able to exclude others from the process—must be right. I hope that the Under-Secretary will reiterate his commitment to that principle, and that his reflection will examine what can be done in a simple and non-bureaucratic way. We do not want to encourage unnecessary bureaucracy or make the procedures unecessarily complex, but wish to support the principle that no one should be debarrred from enfranchisement. That issue was highlighted by the Leasehold Enfranchisement Advisory Service. I hope that the Under-Secretary will be able to give us the benefit of his views on the future of that service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must plead guilty to a sin of omission. I intended to say a word about the Leasehold Enfranchisement Advisory Service in response to the comments of my right hon. Friend the Member for City of London and Westminster, South. As has been said, the service was established shortly after the 1993 Act came into force with joint public and private sector funding. The Government's commitment was to provide initial funding for three years, and that will be fulfilled. I agree with the comments that have been made about the agency's work. It continues to do an excellent job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of current concerns and of the new package of leasehold measures in the Bill, there may be a case for continuing the service on a more permanent footing, with a slightly wider remit covering leasehold management issues. I shall consider the public sector financial implications and we shall look for some private sector finance. I shall report my conclusions on that a later stage, including any necessary changes in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that helpful response and delighted to hear the Minister recognise that there may be a case for a continuing the Leasehold Enfranchisement Advisory Service on a firmer footing. We accept that as there is an addition to public sector finance it may be appropriate to seek a private sector contribution. I welcome that good news. In a positive spirit, wishing to make progress, accepting the Minister's offer to reflect, and looking forward to the results of those reflections in positive proposals on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

New clause 57 was debated at some length during a previous debate on a parallel new clause. The Minister has agreed to reflect on the issues raised, which were on the rights of appeal from a leasehold valuation tribunal where there are technical difficulties which would involve changes to the procedures of the Lands Tribunal. I have received a letter from Judge Bernard Marder, president of the Lands Tribunal, who rightly expresses concern that there will be a significant change in the working methods of the tribunal. The Minister has agreed to look at the point and I should be grateful if he could give us his views on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I shall disappoint the hon. Member for Greenwich somewhat. He may wish to come back to me, but I cannot approach the point in the way that he appears to envisage my doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, as the hon. Gentleman said, important that this clause should be seen as a companion to new clause 41, which the hon. Gentleman moved earlier. New clause 57 seeks to limit the right of appeal from a decision of a leasehold valuation tribunal in cases that arise under the 1993 Act and deal with the collective enfranchisement of flats or the right to an extended lease for individual owners of flats. It would not apply to the enfranchisement of housing under the 1967 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman has said, I expressed sympathy for his earlier amendment, and promised to consider it with my right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor. However, I am less inclined to be sympathetic to the new clause now under discussion and shall set out my reasons for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The valuation of leases for enfranchisement is potentially more complex than many service charge disputes. That applies to the 1967 Act, about which the hon. Member for Greenwich was complimentary on Tuesday, and to the 1993 Act. Issues of principle may arise that require an authoritative interpretation. There were leading Lands Tribunal cases that clarified the position under the 1967 Act; no doubt there will be others under the 1993 Act. Those cases are helpful to leaseholders and landlords and to the numerous local lands appeal tribunals throughout England and Wales in giving precedents to follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[MR. ANDREW F. BENNETT 	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leaseholders go through the enfranchisement process only once, but a service charge dispute can arise regularly. That is an important distinction in relation to the two cases covered by the new clause and by new clause 41. I reiterate that as regards the compulsory sale of property, curtailing the landlord's
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>988</span>
rights would be a serious step. There are distinctions to be made so I can be less sympathetic to new clause 57 than I was to new clause 41.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary is going about this in a strange way. At a time when he would be expected to be as conciliatory as possible he has come back with a cold shower on his previous warm words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there are difficulties and I do not wish to press the new clause against the Under-Secretary's decision. However, there is a point of principle of affordable justice. In circumstances of an imbalance between the ability of the freeholder, who will have expert resources to argue and sustain his case through a series of appeals, and a leaseholder who may be trying to achieve something on a shoestring, knowing that it is his home that is at stake, we must ensure that the powerful and large landowner cannot frustrate the leaseholder simply by taking advantage of the latter's fear of escalating costs. There is substantial evidence that such intimidation does occur, that some landowners use the leaseholder's fear of one appeal after another and ever-escalating costs to discourage him from initiating procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[MR. JOHN MCWILLIAM 	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I accept that, as drafted, the new clause would cause problems because it would necessitate a change in the working methods of lands tribunals, it is not adequate to say that nothing can be done. We must find an alternative way of resolving this issue of affordable justice. I hope that the Under-Secretary will include that as part of his reflecting process between now and Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am generally sympathetic to the points that the hon. Gentleman made but I have to be fair and honest, as he would expect. I draw a distinction between this and the case of service charges, over which there is a possibility of repeated disputes and repeated use by landlords of the threat of protracted legal proceedings and the exercise to the full of rights of appeal incurring costs for leaseholders. This is a different case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I suggest a compromise? I am mindful of what the hon. Member for Greenwich has said. There are many precedents in property law for appeals to the lands tribunals, which tends to be composed of three very senior members of the surveying profession. I wonder whether the mechanism could be an appeal from the leasehold valuation tribunal to the lands tribunal, followed by the usual rights of appeal from the lands tribunal, which are on a point of law—error of award and so on. The precedent exists in property law and it would simplify this process considerably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that we could headline new clause 59 "Cannot sell" and the other three "Cannot stay". I do not expect the Under-Secretary to accept new clause 59. I shall not waste time talking about whether or not capital receipts can be used, spend too long discussing the issue of the right to buy, or criticise building societies. I wish to highlight to the Under-Secretary the real problems that all those have created and to urge him to find a solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary is aware that the Select Committee on the Environment considered housing. One of the issues resulting from the evidence to that Committee was red-lining. By and large, people bought former council properties in two ways. In some instances, they exercised their right to buy to purchase individual flats, the rest of the block remaining with the local authority. In other instances, the local authority emptied blocks of flats, sold them to a private developer who, in turn sold them to individual purchasers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When people exercised the right to buy and bought into new blocks, building societies showed enthusiasm for lending money. However, that enthusiasm has now evaporated. Individuals are now caught in the blocks and when they come to sell, the new purchasers cannot get mortgages, no matter how good their status, and because people cannot obtain mortgages, the value of the properties is reduced. People who are caught in those red-lined properties feel that they have been cheated. It does not matter whether they blame the Government, the building societies or the local authorities. They have been encouraged by the building societies and the Government to believe that it is a good idea to own their properties. People go through that buying process and end up being caught with properties that they cannot sell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That situation is bad enough, but some new property owners, such as development companies, are increasing service charges. As a result, some individuals cannot meet those charges nor can they sell the properties and are under pressure from both directions. Sometimes it is the local authority which, having sold a proportion of the properties in tower blocks, decides that it is necessary to put in new windows or carry out another substantial development and, again, under the leasehold process, increase the charges. It may be more economical to put new windows in all the properties in the block, instead of doing so only in those properties that are council owned but, if individuals do not have the money to meet the resulting increased charges, they will be in great difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Councils such as Wandsworth have been negotiating with the Government for a long time to find a solution to the problem. If the Government wish to continue encouraging people to buy properties, they must bring back certainty into the market. One way in which to do so would be to allow local authorities to become the mortgagee of last resort. That has happened on many occasions. For example, there was a time when the building societies failed society because they would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>992</span>
not offer mortgages on pre-1900 or 1914 properties. Local authorities then stepped in and offered mortgages. Some built up substantial holdings, which they eventually sold to building societies. Local authorities could again become lenders of last resort, although I would much prefer it to be building societies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other way forward would be for the Government to legislate that, once a building society has offered a mortgage on a particular property and subject to the status of the individual, it should continue to offer mortgages on that property, unless some major change occurs such as a motorway being built close to it or a structural fault occurs whereby the owner can apply to the insurance company for compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further problem is likely to develop. The inquiry of the Select Committee on the Environment has shown that there is a need for new dwellings to be built and for many of them to be built on brownfield sites. When the Select Committee considered developments in the west midlands, we saw three or four examples of derelict land that had been reclaimed and on which houses had been built. I wanted to know whether derelict and contaminated land was now fit for use and how its safety was measured. People proudly say, "Well, the building societies will lend money", but I am worried that building societies lend money at the moment on brownfield sites. However, you only need to have two or three pollution scares and suddenly the building societies will pull out of such areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister say what he will do for that group of people—certainly hundreds, probably thousands—who are trapped in unmortgageable flats? They were led into that problem by the Government. What will he do for the people who are in flats that are difficult to sell and for which service charges are suddenly levied? How will that money be raised?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a problem. I do not expect the Minister to spend long discussing the details of new clause 59 and the others in the group, but I hope that he will consider the problem to which I referred and will offer a solution to the large number of people in this country who are affected by it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett), I do not propose to spend much time on capital receipts. I shall not tease the Opposition about their overall attitude to that issue, although we shall all be interested in hearing what the hon. Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford) has to say about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish has identified a genuine problem that exists in Westminster, as elsewhere. I want to mention redlining briefly. It would be hugely helpful if lenders were more honest in their reactions to blocks of flats. We cannot get generic responses to particular blocks, but only individual responses to individual applications for a loan. In the Lisson Green estate in Westminster,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0560">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>993</span>
where there are 1,500 flats which are largely panel built, no loan can be secured, but the responses are all individual ones to an individual application. That puts leaseholders to the expense of making individual applications, involving time, and then receiving negative responses. The reaction appears to be generic, so it would save a great deal of everybody's time if lenders gave generic objections, thereby making the nature of the problem clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Westminster city council has set its face against repurchase by the city council, but as the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish said, it and Wandsworth, which has been cited, are pursuing other options, including purchase by housing associations that want to get into local management or renting out as temporary accommodation, our debate must be necessarily brief because of the hour, so I cannot go into substantial detail. However, I can suggest a particular line of help that the Government could afford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the exchange sales scheme, which was introduced last year—I shall not go into detail because of the time—three mortgage lenders are required to say that a loan cannot be provided for the exchange sales scheme to be triggered and for the council to become involved. The scheme has been well received in Westminster. At least 300 leaseholders have come forward with propositions and 10 people have been serious and carried it the full distance to the wire. But none of them can get three mortgage lenders to express an opinion on the property involved. Therefore, the scheme, which is a genuine attempt to solve the problem, has become neutered. I ask my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to say whether the Government would be prepared to consider either reducing the required number of mortgage lenders to one or, alternatively, offering the city council discretion to decide whether a case is fair against the criteria of the problem that everyone recognises we are seeking to solve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have a responsibility. Everyone has said that we shall not have a long debate on the matter because we are at the end of the Bill, but it is a serious problem and the Government should take some responsibility for what has happened over several years. I was reflecting upon how things have changed. When I got married 30 years ago we should dearly have loved to buy a flat. No one would lend money on flats anywhere then. It was extremely difficult—particularly for someone who did not appear likely to earn much money. When, many years later, I became a councillor, people were able to buy flats with ease from local authorities. I remember that many people then gave warnings. Unfortunately those were not heeded, because everybody thought that everyone else was motivated by dogma. Caught in the middle were people who were trying to determine the best way to proceed. Some of those people are now in flats that are difficult to sell—or to sell at a price which would enable them to obtain suitable new accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>994</span>
It might be worth reflecting on two affected groups. The first consists of people who bought their flats as a couple, when they did not have children, but who, after their family had, expended, encountered the problems of living in flats with children, high up in blocks—sometimes in walk-up blocks, which are even worse than blocks with lifts. That is a problem too for the second group—people who are approaching retirement, who might be disabled, and who live in flats in walk-up blocks. They would never have expected a problem. They were told that it would be wonderful and that they would be masters of their domain, with no problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will examine all the evidence. The Environment Select Committee has looked into the subject in depth and has made recommendations—as have other bodies in the relevant sphere. An hon. Member whom I knew well from the time when we were councillors in Southampton presented a ten-minute Bill some years ago to try to deal with the difficulties that I have outlined. We are all busy talking about properties, but in those properties live families with problems, who had wonderful expectations that have fallen around their feet. If the Under-Secretary is not minded to do exactly what has been asked of him this morning, I hope that he will present a sensible proposal on Report. I know that last year the Government presented some measures that they thought would help. I hope that the Under-Secretary will suggest how successful they have been and say that he will build on our experiences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clauses, which I should normally welcome as being in the spirit of my thinking, draw attention to a problem that we know about. I have forwarded to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary a letter from a tenant, graphically illustrating the problem. We all have an interest in maintaining the quality of the stock. I know that the Government have always had an interest in being fair to people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is not the right arena in which to deal with the problem, which almost stands alone. The new clauses would not deal with the matter as I should deal with it, and they do not present it in the right way. I do not consider it necessary, either, for amendments to be tabled on Report. It might be felt that that would not be the right way of dealing with the matter and that it should be dealt with more directly through the local authorities. However, I feel considerable sympathy about the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish. Fortunately, in my constituency there are not too many properties of the kind that we have been discussing, that cause difficulties for the people who live in them. There are some places in the city of Sheffield, as in all our major cities, where tower block or deck access flats are proving virtually impossible to sell, so that people are effectively trapped in them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is easy to dismiss the problem by saying that no one in their right mind would have bought such a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0561">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>995</span>
property. However, no Government in their right mind should have encouraged people do that. The Government are obsessed with owner occupation and they said that it was a good idea for anyone in any circumstances. Much of the responsibility rests with the Government and I hope that the Under-Secretary will be big enough to accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish said, we are trying to produce ideas that will help a number of people in a severe predicament. New clause 59 would allow local authorities to repurchase such properties. That is an eminently sensible solution to some of the problems. Of course, not everyone's problem would be solved by that mechanism, and not every local authority would take that opportunity if it were offered to it. However, it would be possible to use some capital receipts, which cannot be used for other housing investment purposes, to repurchase such properties and those receipts are in authorities' housing accounts. that is a reasonable and painless way of solving the difficult problems of some people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 61 would offer another possible way forward. It would help people caught by the problems involving work on communal facilities. Such work is often not limited to repairs, but it may lead to improvements. Charges for improvements may cause real difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of new clauses 61 and 79 is to give better information to people so that they are more aware of the potential service charges and costs that they may incur. The Under-Secretary's predecessor commented on this problem in remarks to local authorities such as that on which I served during the 1980s. In my authority of Sheffield, everyone who bought a property was invited to discussions with housing officers not merely about the process of buying, but also about the costs and obligations into which they were entering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that time, Sheffield was condemned by the Government for harassing people who wanted to buy, but all we were doing was giving them information about the potential down sides as well as the benefits of purchase. In particular, we informed those who wanted to buy flats of their potential obligations not just in the initial five-year period, but beyond that to their potential obligations for the communal areas. On every occasion, we advised the purchaser to obtain independent advice and to have an independent survey carried out on the property. We wanted to ensure that they had as much information as possible about the potential costs of buying a property. Sheffield was condemned for dissuading people from buying properties, but all we were trying to do was to provide the best advice to people and to encourage them to take outside best advice. They would then understand what was involved in the purchase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, some people did not take the advice offered and did not obtain outside help. They had been persuaded that the purchase was a cheap deal with no
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>996</span>
potential down sides. Subsequently, they discovered that there were major potential down sides and that there were costs that they had not anticipated. They then faced problems in selling their properties to anyone else. Whatever mistakes people made at that time, we should feel extremely sorry for them. In many cases, people did not go into the purchase with their eyes open and they now face major difficulties. I hope that the Under-Secretary, even if he does not accept our new clauses, will come forward with positive proposals of his own to help people in such tragic and difficult circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hampstead and Highgate)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like other hon. Members I believe that the Government have a responsibility. During the Committee stage of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, the issue of red lining was raised. The problems have been exacerbated in the intervening period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock) pointed out that the inability of many families to sell their flats has a serious impact on them. I know of two such cases in my constituency, and one was precisely as the hon. Member for Christchurch. A couple bought their flat before they had children and they now find it virtually impossible to move. That has an impact on the lives of their children. The second case involves an elderly constituent, who now lives on her own in a property that is much too large for her. She is desperate to relieve herself of the obligation imposed by that property. She has family in another part of the world whom she wishes to join, but she finds it impossible to move.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are also partly responsibility for the enormously escalating costs faced by many of those exercising their right to buy, because local authorities are undertaking a rolling programme of repairs in those estates. In many instances, more work is required than would have been necessary only three years ago, when the Government stopped local authorities entering into such repair schemes. Costs have escalated since then and the Government should bear the majority of that responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) referred to the question whether people entered blindly into the right-to-buy scheme. In many instances, the local authority was precluded—it was told in no uncertain terms—from presenting negative arguments to people proposing to purchase those properties. I remember that my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mrs. Jackson) said during the debate on the 1993 Act that the local authority knew that some houses were erected over old mine workings, yet it was precluded from informing those who might wish to purchase those properties of the possibility of subsidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, the problem is essentially one for families of people who find their lives deteriorating.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0562">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>997</span>
Although there has been a fall in the property market across the whole range of properties, the practice of red-lining has resulted in tenants seeing their properties devalue by as much as 100 per cent. The matter was raised three years ago. It is time for the Government to attempt to relieve people of that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been debating an important subject. I accept that it will be of interest to a number of leaseholders who find themselves in a difficult situation, as outlined by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish. As my right hon. Friend the Member for City of London and Westminster, South pointed out, it is a genuine problem and those leaseholders will be interested to know how the Committee considered it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should make clear that I wish to direct my remarks to those leaseholders who find themselves in difficulty. Of course, not all leaseholders have decided to buy their properties. Recent academic research carried out for the Department of the Environment suggests that the majority of social landlords' leaseholders see their flats as good value for money. However, I accept that a number of leaseholders find themselves in difficult circumstances and that the Committee will be interested in the Government's attitude towards them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an irony that some of those who cannot sell their properties still believe that they are good value for money. They believe that it is inappropriate at the moment; all they want is to be able to get that good value from someone else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that. I may be wrong, but I understand that the research covered wider issues and included all social landlords' leaseholders, not only those who found themselves in this particular difficulty. I know that the Committee will be interested to hear what is taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several members of the Committee referred to the local authority charges, which is one aspect of the problem. The hon. Members for Denton and Reddish and for Hampstead and Highgate spoke about local authority service charges being a problem for a minority of leaseholders. However, we have proposed our own measures—new clauses 66 and 67—which go a long way to alleviating those problems and could make some of the hon. Gentleman's proposals less necessary. Given our shared concern, I intend to approach the matter in a way that underlines how important we consider that problem to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been concerned to take action on behalf of those leaseholders in the past. Hon. Members may be aware of the package introduced last year to assist those leaseholders. A good practice guide was produced to deal with the problem, which I believe was well received by local authorities, and more flexibility was given to local authorities to assist. The exchange sale scheme, to which my right hon. Friend the Member for City of London and Westminster, South referred, was introduced to help leaseholders
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>998</span>
who have an urgent need to move, but who cannot sell their flats because of mortgageability difficulties. It provides a financial concession to local authorities to encourage them to buy back the leaseholder's flat and to sell him a more suitable property at a discount. It has been in operation since July last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must examine carefully the way in which the scheme has been operating. I listened carefully to the important point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for City of London and Westminster, South concerning the requirement for the leaseholder to produce three letters from mortgage lenders about the property. I can tell my right hon. Friend that we are prepared to consider the matter, and particularly to consider whether to allow local authorities to judge whether the problem exists, even if the three letters are not forthcoming. I hope that that will interest my right hon. Friend. I noted particularly what he said about the large numbers of people in Westminster who wanted to take advantage of the exchange sale scheme, which we instituted to assist leaseholders in the circumstances that he described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall take in continuing interest in the matter. When the exchange sale scheme has been in operation for longer, we shall consider whether further measures are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposals for reducing leaseholders' service charges, which I have just mentioned, should make it less likely for people to need to sell their flat. When we see the impact of those proposals, we shall consider whether any other steps are needed, including some of the proposals that have been made today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened carefully to the debate. The Government have been concerned about the problem and have introduced a package to deal with it. There are further measures in the Bill that will be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish acknowledged—very fairly, I thought—that the Opposition's new clause would be difficult for the Government to accept and that it was widely drawn, as the financial concession was based on local authority receipts. Without revisiting all the arguments, I accept that the hon. Gentleman's intention was to highlight the concern about the problem. I hope that I have responded appropriately to that concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish did not speak to the other new clauses, but the hon. member for Attercliffe referred to them. I assume that they were tabled in the same spirit, to highlight the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Attercliffe was anxious that further information should be brought to the attention of leaseholders when they were considering whether or not to buy their flat. Such information should be made available to tenants through booklets, such as the right-to-buy booklets, rather than written into the Bill. The hon. Member for Attercliffe looks concerned. I can tell him that our right-to-buy booklets convey a great deal of relevant information, and our 1995 leasehold good practice guide for local authorities advised them to provide more pre-sale information on future liabilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>999</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I looked concerned because information made available in booklets is often not read. Glossy booklets can remain on shelves or be read selectively. I am anxious that such important information should get through to the people at whom it is aimed, and that it is made available in a form that they will read, rather than skip through without taking on board its relevance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point, but incorporating the information in the notice would not take matters much further. There would simply be a statement of information in the notice, but it would not be followed by any sanction. One hopes that the tenant will take on board the importance of the information, whether it is contained in a notice or a right-to-buy booklet. Such information might more appropriately be placed in a right-to-buy booklet which, one hopes, would be brought to the attention of the leaseholder. If it were written into the Bill, it might in some circumstances not come to the attention of the leaseholder, but it would if it were contained in a booklet. I hope that that disposes of that issue, but I emphasise that the Government take the subject seriously. We will bring forward further proposals later and will continue to take an interest in the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not say that I am disappointed, because I am not surprised at the Minister's response. It is all right to emphasise that some people involved are right-to-buy tenants, but some of the people for whom I have most sympathy are the second people down the line. Many right-to-buy tenants got a big discount, sold at the market price and did quite well. The next person to buy did not receive any warnings, and such people are in many cases those who are stuck with the property. It is important that the Government consider people who bought on from right-to-buy tenants, and those who moved into blocks that were sold off to a developer. Several such developers have now gone into receivership, and the properties have been passed on, so the original promises made about service charges have not been kept. However, in view of what has been said and of the fact that we may later discuss new clauses 66 and 67, I should like to withdraw the motion and return to this important issue on Report.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This brings us to one of the most important issues that we have debated in Committee: the right to manage for leaseholders who are dissatisfied with either the performance or the scruples of their landowner or managing agent. The purpose of the new clause and associated amendments is the reverse the inherently unsatisfactory existing arrangements, under which freeholders are able to profit—in many cases spectacularly—from their unfair position, and to give leaseholders an effective remedy against inefficient or unscrupulous freeholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful if I briefly outline how most long residential leases are organised, and how the current arrangements operate. The landlord is usually covenanted to repair and maintain the fabric of the building and its common areas, and to insure the buildings, while tenants are covenanted to pay the landlord the full costs of arranging that. That arrangement separates the managerial process from obligations to pay. Put simply, it gives the landlord the opportunity to spend other people's money on services. Worse, the landlord is the monopoly supplier of those services. That has created scope for all sorts of abuse, about which we have heard during the Committee's consideration of leasehold. The hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0565">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1003</span>
North-West Leicestershire highlighted in particular the abuse of the power to be the monopoly supplier of insurance, and the use of commissions to provide an unjustified financial return to the landlord. Of course, many other abuses occur as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some restrictions are imposed by the Housing Act 1985, which require the service to be reasonable and give leaseholders a limited degree of remedy against unreasonable demands from the freeholder. Sadly, as the experience of leasehold groups across the country has demonstrated, the balance is still unduly tilted in favour of the landowner and against the leaseholder, and more needs to be done to change that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is still a great deal of scope for landlords to appoint their own in-house company to manage the property, for building works to be carried out by associates of the landlord and, as I have already mentioned, for insurance to be arranged that brings the landlord a large commission. The scope for abuse is inherent in any relationship where one party is given the power to spend another party's money. Sadly, the landlord has no incentive not to act in his own commercial interest. That can be in straightforward conflict with the tenants' interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is designed to provide a proper alternative when leaseholders are dissatisfied with the standard or the cost of the service that they are receiving and when leaseholders are being threatened by unscrupulous freeholders, such as we described last week. They purchase ground rents for relatively small sums and make a very nice living for a modest capital outlay. There is widespread agreement among leaseholders that a right to manage would provide far and away the most effective sanction against such abuses and would also provide an incentive to good landlords to provide a high-quality service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is virtually everything to be said for the new clause. The Government will have some difficulty in arguing against it because they adopted exactly that principle for council tenants, who were given a right to manage a few years ago. If we are going to hear that it is unworkable, unfair and unreasonable, I should like the Under-Secretary to tell us why it is fair, workable and reasonable for council tenants but not for leaseholders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to make a speech because the hon. Gentleman knows that I support him, but does he agree that a long leaseholder is in an even stronger position in moral terms than someone who is a council tenant? A leaseholder has a right to live in his property for a very long time, so morally he is in a much stronger position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman reinforces my argument. I should regard it as one of equity that if a certain right applies to one group of people it should apple to others, but the hon. Gentleman makes a valid point and I am pleased that he supports the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1004</span>
The new clause would not make it obligatory for tenants to assume the responsibility of management. It would be an option available to leaseholders to do so if they wish. Secondly, we are not saying that tenants can in all circumstances simply move in and take over the management, irrespective of the impact on the landlord. We accept the need for proper management to protect the value of the respective interests of both landlords and leaseholders. There is a technical issue involved. For most of the duration of a long lease, the landlord's interest will be relatively small in relation to that of the leaseholder's, but towards the end, as the lease becomes a wasting asset, there is a fairly dramatic change in the balance between the two. That is why we have sought to set out a proposal—it is no more than that, as we are not saying that it is the absolutely correct way of doing it. When the landlord's interest is more than one fifth of the leaseholder's interest, the landlord will have reached a point that we do not believe should apply. It does not apply in the overwhelming majority of leases with a long time to run. When a landlord has recently acquired a long lease, his acquisition costs will be a trifling sum in relation to the value of that of the leaseholder. But as the lease continues and reaches a period of, say, 40 years or less, gradually the landlord's interest rises and in the latter stages it rises dramatically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the purpose of amendment No. 602, which is long, complicated and detailed and which seeks to provide a formula.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but I was wondering whether he would produce a diagram to assist us with amendment No. 602, in view of what he said earlier about diagrams.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. He had better not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. I was troubled about whether my powers of oratory would be sufficient to explain the complexities of amendment No. 602 and wondered whether a diagram might be helpful. However, discretion is the better part of valour on this occasion, so I shall not tempt providence by producing one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is inevitably a slight arbitrary definition. We have chosen 20 per cent. of the value of the leaseholder's interest, but we accept that another figure could have been chosen and possibly even a different formula. But the principle must be right. At the end of the lease when a freeholder has a very substantial interest, leaseholders should be free to take over the management of the property, because they have far more at stake—a point made by the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire—because the value to them of the good management of the properties is greater than the freeholder's direct financial interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment and the new clause would discourage ground rent farmers, who currently acquire substantial assets at very little cost. An example of such a practice concerns a freehold, sold in February 1993, when there was a unexpired term of 119 years to run on the flats.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0566">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1005</span>
The aggregate ground rent of the five flats was £750 per annum. The landlord purchased the freehold for £5,000, but the aggregate market value of the five flats was between £600,000 and £700,000—more than 120 times what the landlord paid for the freehold. The landlord had acquired a monopoly right to supply services to a building worth more than 100 times what he paid for the freehold. One can all too easily see the scope for ground rent farms to try to exploit such properties for their own financial interest, irrespective of the leaseholders' interests. That is why it is important to take action to protect leaseholders' interests against such abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have outlined the case for a right to manage, that would allow leaseholders who were dissatisfied with the standard of service that they were receiving, or who felt that they were being unreasonably exploited, to take control and take over the management. It would not threaten the good landlord whose management was of high quality, and who was not exploiting leaseholders. The leaseholders in such cases would recognise that they had nothing to gain from taking over the responsibilities. The principle is right, and the mechanism should be included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new provision should be distinct from the current provisions of part II of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987, which require the leaseholder to go to court to establish that the freeholder has failed in the discharge of responsibilities. To our knowledge, no one has succeeded in that tortuous and complex process and we need a simpler one. That is the reason for the right to manage. The leaseholders could initiate the required process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the new clause and the amendment, which are long and complex, contain drafting problems. I have no doubt that the Under-Secretary will point out one or two of those. We should be happy to discuss with him any rephrasing to meet such objections. However, the principle is right: leaseholders who are dissatisfied with the service should be able to take over control of the management, in a way that does not jeopardise or undermine the landlord's interest. That is why we have proposed the establishment of a management company on which the landlord, as well as the leaseholders, would be presented, and why we have incorporated a right for the landlord to go to court to set aside the management lease if it is unsatisfactory for some reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Safeguards for landlords are provided in the proposed new arrangements, but the principle of giving leaseholders greater rights and redress against inefficient or unscrupulous freeholders must be right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support new clause 62 and will vote for it, although I shall be voting for the principle rather than the precise wording. There must be exceptions. I am sure that on examination there will prove to be elements of the new clause that go too far, and others that do not go far enough. However, I am interested in the principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Greenwich rightly referred to housing associations and local authorities, where rights
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1006</span>
of management are already available. As I pointed out in my intervention, it would be difficult to think of a stronger case for according management rights than that for the holder of a long lease, when one makes a comparison with tenants of a local authority or housing association. Using the right to self-management may, of course, be the first step towards enfranchisement, but I submit that that can only be a good thing, as I entirely support the right of enfranchisement, and have consistently tried in Committee to extend and simplify it—I have been successful in some aspects, and unsuccessful in others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will reflect on the overall position. I strongly feel that there will be a Bill in about a year or 18 months that will bring together the threads of all the housing Bills. That will enable us to consider all these matters again, and produce proper amendments, in accordance with the will of most people in 1996, rather than harping back to other ages. We shall be able to provide all the safeguards that my right hon. Friend the Member for City of London and Westminster, South wants for our excellent architectural heritage, although, as the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate privately pointed out to me, many of those houses were whorehouses and public houses 100 years ago, so there has been an improvement since then. I accept that what we see today is what we want, although I cannot accept that there is architectural merit in virtually any property along York road or Fulham Palace road, which are subject to the same long leaseholds as the lovely squares of Westminster and the City of London. We must ensure that there is a balance, as there are two sides to the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand why landlords want to manage their properties and why they do not want to pass management to the tenants, who are close to the properties—they know what is wrong and what is required, they will act more quickly and they will maintain the property. Tenants have a tremendous interest in maintenance but, under the present law, it is only at the end of a long leasehold that the landlords have that much interest. That is adequately covered by the relevant parts of the new clauses and amendments. The tenor of the new clauses and the amendments is right—they would provide a halfway house to enfranchisement—so I commend them to the Committee, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will be able to support the principle behind them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to speak to new clause 65, which I tabled. We can all give examples of substantial abuse by landlords in matters of rights of management. The most widely advertised, to which we have all referred, featured in the 	<i>Evening Standard</i> campaign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that there has been a tremendous problem. Although tenants have the right to apply to a court for a manager to be appointed, the hurdles are enormous and, in many cases, tenants have not been successful. That is partly because the provisions under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987 are widely drawn.

I hope that the Government will consider new clause 65, which I tabled as a suggestion as to what they might do to help. I do not believe that it would be totally acceptable to everyone, but it provides a more tightly drawn right than that in the 1987 Act. It would apply only when a building consists of flats with five years left on a long lease. The new clause would give lessees the presumption that, if more than half applied jointly to the court, the court would be able to make an order to appoint a receiver. That would give them the option to take over the management of the building through a management company. I hope that the Under-Secretary will consider it as a suggestion for another way forward in what we all agree is a difficult and problematic area. We need to sort it out, and the new clause gives us the opportunity to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest to the debate. I must say at the outset that I agree with the hon. Member for Greenwich to the extent that there are difficulties about the way in which the new clauses are drafted, but I should also make it clear that there is a difference of principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would distinguish the case of tenants' right to manage under social landlords and local authorities from the case of leaseholders' right to manage. There is a different relationship. We should remember that when a lease is granted, that is an individual decision by an individual property owner to grant an interest in that property to another person. The leasehold arrangement reflects a voluntary agreement between landlord and tenant, which gives certain rights and obligations to each party with regard to the other. It is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1008</span>
right for Parliament to intervene to prevent abuse when one side is in a weaker position than the other. That is what I hope and believe that the package of Government amendments to strengthen leaseholders' rights will do. We have built in some important protections for leaseholders during our proceedings on the Bill. We believe that the package will be effective and will redress the current imbalance between the two parties, in cases in which such an imbalance exists to the detriment of leaseholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be much more cautious if we are contemplating legislation that would deprive property owners of their rights to manage their own property. Clearly, that would be unfair to many competent freeholders who carry out their management obligations efficiently. One thought that comes to mind is that if leaseholders want to take over the management of their block it is surely a much more sensible proposition that they should also purchase the freeholder's equity. Obviously, there are a number of ways in which that can be done, and Government amendments to the Bill have strengthened those existing rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have closed a number of loopholes in the right to first refusal. We have also assisted qualifying leaseholders in the exercise of their rights under existing enfranchisements provisions and closed loopholes regarding flying freeholds. We have dealt with cases in which the premises are not being properly managed by the freeholder; tenants can ask the court to appoint a manager, and new clause 43 strengthens the grounds on which such an application is likely to succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In cases of bad management, leaseholders have other rights and can take steps to acquire the freehold with the approval of the court. I emphasise again that the right of the court to appoint a manager is satisfactory only as a last resort, when it has been demonstrated that the landlord is not doing his job properly. The court-appointed manager will then continue either until the court is convinced that the landlord has mended his ways or, as I have already indicated, after three years the tenants will have an automatic right of compulsory purchase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That question would be more appropriately asked in the context of enfranchisement and the acquisition of the equity in the property rather than of management. My hon. Friend will remember that whatever the difference in equity it is in the beginning the decision of a property owner to grant an interest in the property to another individual. Both sets of individuals have rights, and we have to be keen to protect them. We must also protect individuals who become leaseholders from the sort of abuses that the Committee has heard about.

I have considered new clause 65, tabled by the hon. Member for Christchurch. It would mean too much court involvement in the day to day management of blocks of flats on a permanent basis. That is not a sensible way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that new clause 62 is a valiant attempt to define a right to manage and overcome various difficulties, but, as with existing legislation, a clause with good intentions may end up complex. The complexity derives from the fact that a general right to manage means that leases will have to be rewritten by statute. The schedule contained in amendment No. 601 begins to do that, but we are given only the headings of each chapter. No doubt a number of very important issues would have to be considered in that context which do not appear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon Friend the Member for City of London and Westminster, South referred to the formulae set out in amendment No. 602. That demonstrates the clear difficulty of devising a right to manage that is always fair to landlords, although I accept that the hon. Member for Greenwich set out to do that. There are many complex provisions for valuing landlords' interests, but this one adds to the complexity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike my right hon. Friend the Member for City of London and Westminster, South, I have the disadvantage that my maths teacher took one look at my work and entered me for CSE maths. I do not approach this with the advantages that my right hon. Friend has, although I hasten to tell the Committee that I was successful as I gained CSE grade 1, which was, in those days, equivalent to an O-level. From the lofty position of CSE grade 1, I do not begin to attempt to explain amendment No. 602's provisions, except to say that it illustrates some of the complexity involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments contain several difficulties. The Government are opposed to them in principle too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not engage in an erudite debate with the Minister over the precise interpretation of amendment No. 602. I accept, as he does, that there is a difference of philosophy between us on that. We believe that a right to manage is an appropriate remedy to give leaseholders a sanction against inefficiency and abuse. It is necessary. There have been all too many examples of freeholders acting disgracefully and exploiting leaseholders. We need remedies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ministers said that the right to go to court to appoint a manager could be used only as a last resort. I have no evidence of anyone succeeding in using that supposed last-resort remedy which is so tortuous and complex that it simply is not working. The likes of Mr. Harold Bebington and others behave in quite a disgraceful way and there is evidence from all over about them, but we simply have to face the reality that existing remedies do not work. That is why we have moved a right to manage which would give leaseholders proper redress. We have sought to ensure fairness, too, to the landlord, however complex that may be. I hope that the Minister will accept the new clause and its related amendments. I shall offer
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1010</span>
straightforwardly to sit down with him between now and the Report stage to go through the complexities and iron out the difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause and the amendments should be in the Bill as a symbol of this Parliament's decision to defend the interests of leaseholders and to put a stop to the appalling abuses that have taken place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hope that the Government will take on board the principles involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clauses 63 is a follow-up to an amendment that I moved earlier. It would require notice to be given before issuing possession proceedings against certain people. We have all shown great concern for the problems of the mentally ill. We know that such people can survive with the proper support of social services and health authorities. However, even when there is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1012</span>
proper support, landlords undertake possession proceedings against tenants who have mental health problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Often, tenants who have mental health problems fail to attend court proceedings, and such people are undefended even when guardians should have been appointed. We all know how easy it is for people to slip through the net. Sometimes those problems can be resolved if social services are alerted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 27 February, I moved a similar proposal on introductory tenancies, to which the Minister responded:
	<br><q><p>"I said in response to that debate that I believed that, in principle, the guidance should deal with that. I undertook to examine the matter to see whether the guidance needed to be supplemented. To be consistent, I make the same promise in relation to the amendment."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee G,</i> 27 February 1996; c. 365.]</p></q>
Of course, guidance cannot extend to the private sector. The Minister has no statutory power to give guidance in the private sector. Private landlords would not normally consider such guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would apply to all possession actions. It would require notice to be given to the social services where the landlord believes that the defendant might have mental health problems. The landlord would have to do that before he could issue his proceedings. That would not be an onerous task. I hope that the Government will consider new clause 63 favourably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of new clauses 85 and 86 is similar, but they deal with different matters. New clause 85 seeks to ensure that social landlords who obtain a suspended possession order cannot enforce it by means of a warrant for possession without first obtaining the court's leave.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
