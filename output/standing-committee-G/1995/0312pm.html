<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration (Mr. David Curry)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 349, in page 68, line 26, leave out from "already" to end of line 28 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"—
<ol>
<li>a secure or introductory tenant,</li>
<li>an assured tenant (otherwise than under an assured shorthold tenancy) of housing accommodation held by a registered social landlord, or</li>
<li>an assured tenant of housing accommodation allocated to him by a local housing authority.".</li></ol></p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 350.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Bill as drafted permits transfers within authorities, but because of an oversight, it does not provide for transfers between authorities outside the framework of the housing register. The amendments will remedy that unintended omission and will make those two forms of transfer possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Diana Maddock <span class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification of one point. Does the Minister consider that the amendments would cover the circumstances that I am about to describe? You might have a tenant whom the council thought it still appropriate to house, but against whom, because of previous difficulties, a suspended possession order had been made for nonpayment of rent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not have any tenants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. McWilliam.<br><br>
The problem may then be sorted out and the tenant may stay on, but later he may need to be rehoused because he has more children, or because the council wants to demolish the property. Alternatively, the tenant may die and the council may want to carry on the tenancy for the widow. Would the amendments cover such cases?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As long as the person remains a tenant—whatever has happened in the meantime—he or she will be covered by the amendments.</span></p>

Clause 123</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
CASES WHERE PROVISIONS ABOUT ALLOCATION DO NOT APPLY</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 433, in page 68, line 32, leave out from first "of to "do" in line 33 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"sections 125, 126 and 127 of this Act.".</p></blockquote>
I shall be brief. The amendment would mean that the exemptions in the clause would apply to clauses 125, 126 and 127, thereby providing that the exemptions would be from the housing register procedure only and not from the right to information under clause 129. People may need to be part of the authority's allocation scheme but not necessarily of the register process. We believe that the information that they receive should apply equally to those covered by this clause and to the proposed additions to the list referred to in other amendments that we shall be moving this afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of clause 123 is to exclude certain classes of tenancy from the allocation provision in this part of the Bill. The amendment would exempt them from the provisions relating to the housing register but would require them to be subject to the allocation provisions. I find that difficult to understand. It would mean that cases prescribed in regulations made under subsection (5) would be subject to the allocation criteria. The purpose of the regulations is to allow a limited set of cases, such as referrals, to be granted accommodation outside the allocations scheme. Amendments Nos. 429 to 432 show that hon. Members are happy with that proposition, so I am a little foggy about what amendment No. 433 is seeking to achieve. It would also mean that the established rights of succession, as set out in subsections (2) and (3) would apply only if a successor had sufficient priority in the allocation scheme as set up by the local authority. There would be a conflict in the law. Succession rights are succession rights; does not it make sense to try to restrict them in this way. I do not think that we would want to require, for example, the widowed spouse of a deceased tenant, who may have lived in the property for many years, to be subjected to such a test to remain in the home. I invite the hon. Lady not to persist with the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has explained how he thinks the Bill will operate. I hope that he is right. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Raynsford <span class='memberconstituency'>(Greenwich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 370, in page 68, line 33, at end insert—

<li>A person who is referred to the authority by a health authority.</li>
<li>A person who is referred to the authority by a registered social landlord or voluntary organisation providing temporary accommodation for single homeless people, and which has nomination rights with that authority.</li>
<li>A person who is referred to the authority by a voluntary organisation which has nomination rights with that authority.".</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take responsibility for only three of the amendments as the others stand in the name of the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock). I shall speak specifically to amendments Nos. 370, 371 and 372. They would exclude certain categories of people or allocation from the general provisions of the clause, which otherwise determines the exclusions from the allocation procedure. The first category covers nominations in respect of young peole leaving care; the second, nominations in respect of people moving through housing mobility schemes; and the third, nominations in respect of people moving from supported temporary accommodation.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 606</span>
The three categories do not fit comfortably with the concept of the single standard housing register that we debated this morning. Young children leaving care require access to accommodation when they are discharged from care if they would otherwise become homeless. There is no point in their being told that they can leave care and live on the streets in a cardboard box while their applications are being considered on a waiting list. That would be ridiculous. They need to be able to move directly from care into appropriate permanent accommodation.<br><br>
At present, a number of local authorities provide specific quotas of secure tenancies to social services departments precisely for such purposes. That is sensible. Young people in care have often experienced much disruption in their lives. If they are fortunate, that may have involved only a move from an unsatisfactory home, or from a home where there has been a tragedy or a disaster, to a specific period in care. However, in many cases such people will have been subjected to a whole series of disruptive moves in their lives and what they require is the certainty of being able to move into permanent accommodation. When good after-care services are available, they must be backed up by secure accommodation so that the young person can settle down and begin to establish an independent life.<br><br>
For all those reasons, access to permanent low-cost social housing is important for such young people and it is crucial that such provision should continue to be made. In 1993, 6,360 young people aged over 16 ceased to be subject to a care order. In a sense, that is the maximum number of people for whom such provision may be required. Some could secure accommodation through other routes, but a high proportion of them would be dependent on accommodation being secured through the local authority. The number of such people is not large compared with the total number of tenancies nationally, but it is crucial for them that provision is made available. They should have the opportunity of immediate access and not have to go through a period of notionally waiting on a waiting list.<br><br>
The second category comprises people who are seeking a move under a mobility scheme. Such schemes are important for various reasons. They give people the opportunity to move from one area to another for jobs-related reasons, for social reasons or because they want to move from an area where they have suffered violence or unhappiness and return to another part of the country where they may have friends and relatives who can give them support. In 1990 a national housing mobility scheme—HOMES—was set up to help people find a way through the obviously complicated process of getting an application considered by another authority. Where such agreements apply, it is important that they operate on a basis of understanding between different authorities which will contribute to such a scheme only if they believe that they will get something out of it. Clearly, such a scheme would be entirely disrupted if any allocation under the HOMES process had to pass a separate set of hurdles—the authority's own housing register—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0346">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 607</span>
before it could be considered under the housing mobility scheme, HOMES. For those reasons, we believe that the needs of people seeking mobility nominations should also be excluded.<br><br>
The third category includes cases in which there are nomination rights to move people from supported accommodation, which is similar to the first example that I described—children leaving care—where there is a need for rehousing directly when the social services authority considers that that is appropriate to ensure that those involved receive continuing care and support. Groups affected would include elderly people, disabled people, people with mental health problems and people with learning disability. When such people need to be rehoused, they must be given appropriate accommodation which is available immediately, not after a period on a waiting list, where they can receive help and support from social services. There are strong, practical reasons for excluding all three categories. I hope that the Minister will accept our case and agree that they should be excluded from the principal arrangements of clause 123.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak to amendments Nos. 430 to 432, 435, and new clause 32. The hon. Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford) and I have similar concerns about various groups which should be prescribed within the Bill, rather than under regulations, so that they could be dealt with without being included in the register. The Minister has given us various assurances about what might, or might not, happen later. I hope that he will take on board what we are saying and deal with such matters on Report.<br><br>
There is some overlap between the amendments that I tabled and those that the hon. Member for Greenwich tabled. The purpose of amendment No. 430 is to exempt from clauses 125, 126 and 127 people whom social service authorities refer to local housing authorities. That would mean that vulnerable people could be allocated long-term tenancies when they were referred by social service authorities. Social service departments often work in conjunction with housing authorities, and they have duties under the Children Act 1989 and under the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 when dealing with health services.<br><br>
Many people—such as elderly and disabled people, those with mental health problems and those with learning disabilities—come into such categories. At present, local authorities have flexibility, which they value, to offer nominations to groups outside the main waiting lists. The amendments would ensure that such practices continue under the Bill.<br><br>
Amendment No. 431 deals with the people that local health authorities might refer to local authorities. Amendment No. 432 is slightly different; it deals with people whom those voluntary organisations that have nomination rights refer to authorities. Such arrangements are especially valuable. I was a councillor before I became a Member of Parliament, and I had personal experience of a local charity that provided a place where people with alcohol problems were treated and dried out. People were given plenty of after-care and placed in move-on accommodation,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 608</span>
but, at the end of the day, the idea was to move them into their own tenancies in the community. On the housing committee of which I was a member, we regularly heard of successful cases. Many other bodies deal with groups of people who have specific difficulties. I hope that the Minister will also take them into consideration.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
Amendment No. 435 is a sort of extension of amendment No. 432. We want to ensure that single people who are provided with temporary supported accommodation in hostels owned by a local housing authority or another social landlord are able to move into permanent housing when that support is no longer required. That is important because unless people who need temporary supported accommodation can go into move-on accommodation, the temporary supported accommodation will silt up. If people have to go through the register, as the Bill proposes, many such schemes will find it difficult to take on new clients.<br><br>
People need support for all sorts of reasons, and some incredibly good schemes around the country are run by local authorities, voluntary groups and, in some cases, housing associations. Sometimes such schemes are run by a combination of such groups. I was lucky enough to be involved in setting up a young persons' hostel. The building was given by the local authority; one housing association was responsible for getting the building into reasonable condition and another was responsible for giving support and running the hostel. If that hostel was not able to move people on, its purpose would wither away, because it would be silted up with clients.<br><br>
New clause 32 goes a little further. The Minister demonstrated that he had some understanding of our concerns this morning. New clause 32 would ensure that, as far as is reasonable, homeless people are given priority over people who may be considered to have reasonable preference. The purpose of the new clause is to ensure that the Bill does not undo the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977.<br><br>
Again, the new clause mentions particular groups such as young people leaving care and people referred by social services, a health authority, social landlords and voluntary organisations. As the hon. Member for Greenwich said, many groups have nomination rights and are given allocations. That system has worked very well. People are helped and provided with support when they need it; then they return to the mainstream of society—if I may describe it in that way—and do not need that support. We should not include in the Bill anything that will undermine the very good work that has been done not only by local authorities but by housing associations and a multitude of voluntary and charitable groups.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The general aim of part VI of the Bill is to establish the housing register and the allocation scheme as the main route of entry into social housing allocated by local authorities. Clause 123 provides for certain exceptions to those arrangements. Some of those exceptions refer to the granting of new tenancies
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0347">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 609</span>
in situations already covered by statute—for example, exchanges and successions—that will be subject to regulations.<br><br>
The consultation paper issued on 25 January invited views on what further exemptions from the register were required. Clearly, we want to wait for the outcome of that consultation before reaching a final conclusion, but we have sympathy with some of the proposals made in this group of amendments. We need to be careful about the details, such as the reason for the exceptions, their extent and the ability of the housing authority to control entry into its own stock. There is much detailed technical work to be done to specify and set out the precise circumstances in which the provisions of part VI should not apply. That is best done in regulations, which have statutory force and would allow flexibility to adapt the provisions as new special cases arise.<br><br>
Amendment No. 371 is easily dealt with. Government Amendment No. 349 to clause 122 excludes all transfers by secure and assured tenants. Like the hon. Member for Greenwich, we had in mind the need to protect the viability of initiatives such as the Housing mobility scheme, HOMES, which the Government support. By putting all transfers of existing secure and full assured tenants outside the scope of part VI, I hope that we are already achieving what hon. Members seek in the amendment.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 370, 430 and 431 would all set referrals by welfare bodies or health or social services authorities outside the scope of part VI. Housing authorities should work closely alongside such bodies in helping to deliver an integrated package of care and support under a range of statutory provisions, including those in the Children Act 1989 and the care in the community legislation.<br><br>
There may well be merit in making some exceptions along the lines suggested, although we would have to make sure that they were carefully delineated. We would also want to ensure that the housing authority retained a degree of control over who was admitted to its stock in this way. There is no question of giving unconditional rights to place people in housing accommodation to bodies that have no responsibility for the management of that housing.<br><br>
Although I do not believe that those matters rightly belong in the Bill, we will give sympathetic consideration to including them in the regulations that will follow. I therefore invite Opposition Members to withdraw the amendments.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 372 and 435 both seek to provide that referrals to a local authority for permanent accommodation as part of a strategy to free temporary accommodation for single homeless people should be outside the allocation scheme and its priorities. Once again, I understand the point being made. The success of the rough sleepers initiative, for example, has depended heavily on our ability to move people out of hostels and into longer-term accommodation, both to establish a new start for those people and to free bed
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 610</span>
spaces in the hostels. We specifically stated in our consultation paper our willingness to consider an exemption for that purpose.<br><br>
I do not entirely understand what situations the hon. Member for Christchurch seeks to deal with through amendment No. 432. I am not clear how voluntary organisations have nomination rights with local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I used the wrong phrase in the amendment, but I know that if a good case is made, certain local authorities will house the person. In Southampton, where I served as a councillor for a number of years, that happened, especially with business organisations, as I described. They knew that if they made a good case, the authority would accept the person.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the intention was probably to put voluntary bodies on the same basis as statutory agencies when they carried out clearly defined tasks that had a statutory underpinning. If that is the case—the hon. Lady is indicating her assent—I have no problem with the proposition that referrals from voluntary bodies and statutory agencies should be treated in the same way.<br><br>
To summarise our views on amendments Nos. 370, 371, 372,430,431,432 and 435, I have sympathy with what hon. Members are trying to achieve, provided that it is kept within reasonable limits, but I believe that that should be done through regulations. I undertake to reflect on the matter sympathetically during the consultation exercise. I therefore ask hon. Members to withdraw the amendments.<br><br>
New clause 32 uses rather strange language to give a fast track to anyone referred to a local housing authority by a voluntary organisation, social services authority or health authority. If we adopted the new clause, I am not sure that we would need a housing allocation policy: allocations would be in the gift of agencies rather than the housing authority, and they could refer clients without regard to the consequences. As I said when we discussed clause 122, we recognise the need to safeguard referral arrangements. They are needed for the housing authorities, who have to manage the stock. Therefore, I cannot accept that amendment; I invite the hon. Lady to withdraw it.<br><br>
I have sought to be helpful about that batch of amendments because I sense that the Committee has the same purposes in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that helpful response. I remain a little puzzled as to why he believes that the specific exemptions that we have been pursuing should be dealt with by regulation rather than in the Bill, particularly as the assignment of secure tenancies by way of exchange is included in clause 123(2)(c). The mobility cases that I advocated, and which the Minister recognised as a need, are entirely analogous with that. I am not sure of the logic that some provisions should be in the Bill but others have to be made by regulation.</span></p>

In the meantime, I would welcome a little clarification of why moving under a home exchange should come under regulations when moving on an assignment by way of exchange is in the Bill. That is perhaps a little ungenerous to the Minister. He has made a helpful and positive offer, which I am happy to accept. I shall withdraw the amendment, but I should first like a little clarification on that distinction, which seems to be not entirely logical or consistent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall seek to help the hon. Gentleman. If he is still dissatisfied, I shall write to him at greater length. The exemptions in the Bill are to be found in existing legislation. We are carrying through from existing legislation the right to assign tenancies by way of exchange. That extends beyond the cases covered by amendment No. 349 the right, for instance, to cover exchanges between secure tenants and assured tenants of other types of social landlord, such as non-registered housing associations, which are not registered social landlords.</span></p>

The hon. Member for Greenwich and I have similar views on the matter. I have listened to the Minister.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of many of the amendments that we are discussing this afternoon is to enable us to express our concern about the fact that homeless families will not have the priority that many hon. Members and organisations believe that they should. I offer a selection of amendments to the Minister—whether some are more acceptable than others, I do not know.<br><br>
Amendment No. 429 would exempt homeless households from the requirement to register on the single housing waiting list, the purpose of which we debated this morning. The amendment represents an extension of the types of cases that the Secretary of State has said will be exempt from the requirement to register on the single housing waiting list, and I hope that the Minister will consider it favourably. As we have argued repeatedly during our proceedings, households and families suffer an incredible trauma when they are made homeless. If they have to wait on the housing list for long, they may have to move in and out of temporary accommodation. My main concern is families, and I have yet to hear the Government make any comment on what they believe their proposals will do to families and whether they are concerned. When we discuss other issues, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0349">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 613</span>
Government are keen to talk about families, and I wish that they would talk about them in relation to the Housing Bill, as the home is the heart of the family.<br><br>
The Government should consider more widely the costs; keeping homeless families in temporary private accommodation is much more expensive than keeping them in lower cost, long-term accommodation, as we discussed this morning. We welcome the fact that the Minister agrees that families should have some security and should be looked after for more than 12 months, but rents in the private sector are typically two or three times as high as social sector rents, and 80 per cent. of homeless families are in receipt of housing benefit. In 1995, Shelter produced the document "Too high a price", which set out clearly the costs to the nation of keeping homeless families in the private rented sector. It estimated that if families were housed in the social rented sector we could save £118 million.<br><br>
Amendment No. 434 is similar. It asserts the principle that if, as the Government propose, waiting lists are to be the sole route of entry to secure social housing tenancies, all homeless households should be registered on the waiting lists automatically, as soon as they are accepted as homeless. I hope that the Minister will consider that amendment carefully, even if he cannot look favourably at the other amendments that we shall discuss this afternoon.<br><br>
New clause 31 emphasises the fact that the Liberal Democrats believe that homeless households should have a priority over others who have reasonable preference. We believe that there can be no need greater than that of those who are without a home. I have already outlined some of the factors that I believe the Government should take into account, particularly the welfare of families. If they are not interested in that, they should consider the cost of keeping homeless families and others in the private rented sector. There is every good reason for placing such families in secure accommodation as soon as possible. Not only will it be better for the families and their life chances—which will be better for our communities—but it will save Government Departments much money. We spend an enormous amount treating people who suffer from health problems because they live in unsuitable, damp and cold accommodation. I hope that the Minister will accept what I, other hon. Members and the housing bodies that have written to us are saying on the issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The position of the hon. Member for Christchurch and myself is now reversed. I hope that the Minister will again recognise the virtue of the amendments and agree to consider them if they are withdrawn. I hope that the hon. Lady will allow me the opportunity to intervene on her speech, as I allowed her to intervene on mine, before she begs leave to withdraw the amendment.<br><br>
Amendment No. 384 would have a similar effect to some of the amendments spoken to by the hon. Lady. A person to whom the authority has obligations under clause 151 would be entitled to be offered accommodation. That goes to the heart of our debate this morning. If the amendment were accepted, it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 614</span>
would ensure that homeless people were not precluded from being offered permanent accommodation. We know—the Minister made the point this morning—that many homeless people spend time in temporary accommodation, often because of practicalities rather than policy. An authority often cannot offer permanent accommodation immediately and has to arrange temporary accommodation for a period of time. We argue that that should happen only when it is not possible for the authority to offer permanent accommodation rather than as a point of principle. We believe that an authority should be able to offer permanent accommodation to any homeless applicant to whom it has accepted an obligation under the provisions of clause 151. I stress that the amendment would apply to all homeless applicants to whom the authority has an obligation and not just to those registered on the waiting list who have sufficient points—or nearly enough points, whatever that may mean—to qualify for rehousing. All homeless applicants would be covered by the amendment.<br><br>
That would be a logical basis for a proper and sensible allocation policy. An authority should not be precluded from offering permanent, secure accommodation to a homeless applicant. It should have a duty to house that person directly into permanent accommodation. That goes right to the heart of the Bill. I make it clear to the Minister that I accept that that is not compatible with the view set out in the White Paper or, indeed, the Bill itself. It would involve a further shift beyond that already made by the Minister, but it would be a shift in the right direction towards a sensible, coherent housing policy that could be implemented properly and humanely by local authorities. I hope that the Minister will accept the logic of the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the provisions in part VI is to create a single route into social housing, which the hon. Member for Greenwich derides, but which he accurately diagnosed in his initial comments. The underlying needs of everybody would be assessed on a common basis, so that the needs of somebody who is homeless would be set alongside the needs of others on the housing register.<br><br>
Amendment No. 429 would undermine the thrust of parts VI and VII of the Bill by putting the allocation of long-term accommodation to anybody covered by the homelessness legislation outside the scope of the allocation scheme. Nationally, more than a third of all permanent accommodation goes to those who are accepted as homeless—the figure is a great deal higher in some London boroughs. The amendment would restore the fast track into long-term housing that the current homelessness legislation provides. Therefore, I shall resist the amendment.<br><br>
New clause 31 seeks to achieve the same goal of securing priority for those who are accepted as homeless, although it approaches it in different language. It is difficult to see how an authority can give absolute priority only "as far as is reasonably practicable". Things are either absolute or they are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0350">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 615</span>
not. For instance, you cannot be half pregnant; but others might misinterpret that remark and transpose it into a different context.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It would be a biological impossibility for me to be even a quarter pregnant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In your case, Mr. McWilliam—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Pauses do not appear on the record.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have to say, Mr. McWilliam, that a speaking note given to me earlier by the bureaucrats to my left included a note, printed in capital letters, which said: "If pressed on sexuality". I am glad to say that I was not pressed, and thus not in danger of becoming even fractionally pregnant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is hanging on the Minister's words and we would like to know what he was advised to say if pressed on sexuality.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can sense that you are anxious to return to the strict interpretation of clause 123, Mr. McWilliam, and I shall adhere to your judgment.<br><br>
Whatever the language, I have difficulty with the proposition that rehousing those accepted as being statutorily homeless should have priority over rehousing everyone else. Even now, many authorities claim not to give homeless acceptances absolute priority because of other urgent cases. However, I have some sympathy with amendments No. 384 and 434, although the hon. Member for Greenwich will not be surprised to hear that I believe that those provisions should be made by regulation rather than in primary legislation.<br><br>
We suggested in the January consultation paper that, as a minimum, a household rehoused by a local authority under the new two-year homelessness duty from outside that authority's area should have the right to go on the placing authority's register. That would discourage authorities from exporting families to whom they owed a homeless duty, but there may be merit in extending that right to anyone to whom a duty was owed under homelessness legislation. I shall look at that matter carefully when I consider responses to the consultation exercise. I shall consider the proposition made in the amendment in the light of those responses. On that basis, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 384 would give an authority the right to house individuals who qualify under clause 151. The Minister did not address that point. He said that he had some sympathy with the amendment, but that he would deal with the matter by regulation. What form of words will he use? It would be a step forward if the regulations used the words of the amendment to say who was entitled to qualify for rehousing. That is distinctly different from the Minister saying that he had general sympathy, that homeless families could be registered and that the registration and subsequent waiting time would entitle the local authority to qualify them. The distinction is whether a homeless person is entitled to be put on the list automatically
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 616</span>
and then treated like everyone else on the list, or whether, by virtue of the fact that they are homeless, an authority can decide that homelessness is of itself, sufficient reason to make an allocation. Which of those is it? Amendment No. 384 is clear that the authority has the right to rehouse someone by virtue of the fact that they qualified under clause 151 and has nothing to do with waiting because of an allocations policy determined by that local authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can interpret the amendments only according to the language used in them. Hon. Member's explanations of amendments may, on occasions, give me an insight that I could not otherwise have obtained. That often happens in Committee and it is on that basis that I have, in the past, undertaken to consider certain amendments that I was initially disposed not to accept, because their purpose was explained. The crucial phrase in amendment No. 384, and the matter that I am prepared to consider in the light of the consultation, is
<br><blockquote><p>"qualified to be allocated housing accommodation by that authority."</p></blockquote>
The amendment does not state that the person shall receive immediate allocation under the scale of priorities; it states that he is eligible to have housing allocated to him once his needs have been assessed. I interpret the amendment as referring to eligibility to go on the register, not to priority in allocation. I must clarify that, to avoid misunderstandings. Had I made the opposite interpretation, I would have been sympathetic to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Christchurch, which would have made homelesseness a direct, immediate cause of allocation. We must be clear about that.</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'> Perhaps I can help the Minister. Amendment No. 384 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Any person to whom an authority owes a duty under Section 151 … is qualified to be allocated housing accommodation by that authority."</p></blockquote>
That does not give the person any automatic priority—on that, I am at one with the Minister—but equally it does not limit the obligation to putting the person on the register. As I understand it, the entitlement to go on a register exists in any case, under the Government's proposed arrangements.<br><br>
The amendment is intended to make it possible for an authority, where it considers it appropriate, to allocate housing accommodation to a person by virtue of the fact that it owes him an obligation under section 151—in other words, the person is homeless, in priority need and not intentionally homeless. In moving the amendment, I stressed that it would give authorities a measure of discretion to operate the scheme sensitively and properly, without having to refuse to consider permanent rehousing of any homeless person, except those who fall into the permitted categories.<br><br>
I stressed that the amendment would not relate just to those who were already on the register and had a high level of points or nearly enough points to qualify; it would apply to everyone to whom the authority
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0351">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 617</span>
owes a duty under section 151. That was the spirit in which I moved the amendment and that is my interpretation of it. As a non-lawyer, however—thank heavens there are still quite a few of us here—I accept that, in practice that may not be how the courts or others would interpret the amendment. I thought that it was only fair to the Minister to explain its purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that we are not far apart, but I am not sure. The hon. Gentleman's explanation is helpful because he has made it clear that the amendment would give local authorities flexibility. As I said this morning, that is our intention. The amendment may not achieve the hon. Gentleman's objectives, but I am anxious to find common ground on the matter, so I repeat my offer to examine it in the light of the hon. Gentleman's explanation, with a view to including it in the regulations after the consultation. If I find that the interpretations start to differ or other problems arise, I will consult the hon. Gentleman to try to find a way through. That seems a sensible way to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that helpful response. If the hon. Lady intends to withdraw her amendment, I shall be pleased to accept the withdrawal of amendment No. 384.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is no need to withdraw the amendment, as it has not been put.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remember your tutoring, Mr. McWilliam, on the Finance Bill. You will always keep us in proper order. But it is confusing for people that we are discussing an amendment that we can withdrawn later but not yet.<br><br>
I thank the Minister for his comments. Obviously, we welcome anything that would give a little more priority to homeless families than does the Bill as drafted. The Minister talked about present practice and gave figures. I am worried that present practice and gave figures. I am worried that present practice may change when the Bill is enacted. That is why I am so keen—as are other people—to maintain the principle of the 1977 Act: homeless families get priority.<br><br>
I am as aware as the Minister that just saying that homeless families will be given priority over other people on a common register does not mean that it will happen. In many cases, the accommodation is not available. We are talking about the principle that if you are homeless, you have, the greatest need. Something needs to be done now, not after you have been waiting on the list for some time. I am sure that we will return to the matter later, but I beg to ask leave to withdrawn the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 367, in page 69, line 13, after "proceedings)", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"or under section 7 of and Schedule 1 to the Matrimonial Homes Act 1983 (transfer of certain tenancies on divorce, etc) or under section 15 of and Schedule 1(2)(e) to the Children Act 1989 (transfer of property in the interests of a child).".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Neither I nor the Minister is a lawyer. However, we all get lots of advice from lawyers about the Bill. I want the Minister to consider the wording of the Bill to see whether it will ensure that when various court orders are made, local authorities will be able to act on them. I will do my best to explain the amendments to the Minister; I am sure that he has people advising him.<br><br>
The normal rule will be that housing can be allocated only to "qualifying persons" on the register, under clause 124, and in accordance with the council's allocation scheme, under clause 128. Clause 123 includes the list of circumstances in which the other provisions of part VI will not apply. Clause 123(2)(e) and (3)(d) will ensure that the provisions of part VI will not inhibit a family court from exercising powers under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 when directing the transfer of a local authority tenancy from one spouse to the other on the dissolution of a marriage. But is seems to some that there is an oversight: the clause fails to make similar provision for two other circumstances in which a family court can order the transfer of a local authority tenancy. I am advised that the problem hinges on definitions—what we are talking about when we say that a housing authority is allocating accommodation.<br><br>
First, a family court can order the transfer of a tenancy between spouses at the end of a marriage under the Matrimonial Homes Act 1983. That Act is often used in family cases as a simple alternative to the procedure under the 1973 Act. It benefits the same people—abandoned wives of council tenants—in the same way, but by a different legal route. Secondly, a family court can order the transfer of a tenancy between one parent and another—including unmarried parents—under the Chidlren Act 1989, where to do so is in the interests of the children, or where the accommodation provides a family home, but the tenancy is in the name of an unmarried father who is abandoning his partner and children, for example.<br><br>
There seems to be no logical justification of confining the exceptions in clause 123 to only one of the three ways in which a family court may deal with a council tenancy. The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that the Bill covers the other two ways, and I should be grateful for the Minister's comments, because no doubt he will also have received legal advice.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 619</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a fairly complicated business, but I think that I can be helpful. Amendments Nos. 366 and 367 are drafted in identical terms. The first relates to secure tenancies, the second to introductory tenancies. Both would add references to certain provisions in the Matrimonial Homes Act 1983 and the Children Act 1989 to the cases that clause 123 excludes from the provisions of part VI of the Bill.<br><br>
Under section 7 of and schedule 1 to the Matrimonial Homes Act 1983, a divorce court may order the transfer of a protected, statutory or secure tenancy from one spouse to another. Those 1983 Act provisions overlap the wider provisions, about transfer of assets generally, in the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, to which clause 123 already refers. Moreover, the Family Law Bill, which has been the subject of a certain amount of debate in another place, includes provisions that will re-enact, with modifications, the relevant provisions in the 1983 Act. The legislative position is at present complicated, but I am sympathetic in principle to the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Christchurch, and I shall, if necessary, bring forward amendments in due course to this part of the Bill.<br><br>
Under paragraph 1(2)(e) of schedule 1 to the Children Act 1989, a court can make an order assigning a tenancy so as to make provision for a child. The tenancy may be assigned to an applicant for the benefit of the child, or to the child himself. However, section 91 of the Housing Act 1985 prohibits the assignment of a secure tenancy except in three specified cases. Those exceptions include orders made under section 24 of the Matrimonial Causes Act, but there is no reference to orders made under the Children Act 1989. It is probable that when the Children Act was passing through Parliament the need to amend the Housing Act 1985 in that respect was overlooked.<br><br>
Westminster City Council has been in touch with my Department about rectifying what it considers to be an anomaly. I am considering with relevant colleagues whether the Housing Act 1985 should be amended to include reference to orders made under the Children Act 1989 and, if necessary, I shall bring forward amendments.<br><br>
I hope, therefore, that the hon. Lady will be assured that we are on the case, and that she will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Considering the fact that neither the Minister nor I is a lawyer, I do not think that we have done too badly. The matter is important to those whom it will affect, and I was rather gentle in my opening remarks when I said that the matter had perhaps been overlooked, in that I failed to say that it was obvious that it had been overlooked.<br><br>
I welcome the Minister's comments, and I look forward to seeing what he will bring forward on this and other amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

Therefore, we face a dilemma: on the one hand, there is the sea-green, incorruptible principle that legislation should be clear in the Bill and that there should not be too many powers available to the Secretary of State to do things by regulation; on the other hand, there is the more pragmatic view that such regulatory powers might be beneficial both in the short term and in the medium to long term, as my hon.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 377, in page 69, line 29, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) Nothing in subsection (1) above shall render ineligible under this Part any asylum-seeker.".</p></blockquote>
This is a more substantial, important and highly controversial matter. As hon. Members know only too well, the Home Office and the Department of Social Security have introduced several extremely restrictive policies during recent months. They have restricted both the entitlement of asylum seekers to benefits and the circumstances in which people qualify for asylum. The amendment is designed to ensure that those who seek asylum are not penalised while they are waiting for their application to be considered.<br><br>
The amendment would enable asylum seekers to qualify for accommodation if they were homeless, as they have done in the past. The removal of that important right is an affront to many of the standards that we believe are intrinsically important to this country's reputation as a place where people who have suffered persecution can seek asylum.<br><br>
We are extremely concerned about the restrictive policies that the Government have introduced. We are extremely worried that many asylum seekers will find themselves homeless and penniless because of those measures. We can operate only within the remit of the Bill; we cannot address the wider wrongs that are being done to asylum seekers. However, we can make it clear that they must be entitled to housing while their application is considered.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 621</span>
Several policy issues are implicit in those matters, such as the length of time taken to consider an application for asylum. One of the depressing features of recent years has been the lengthening queues for the assessment of applications for asylum. All parties within the House realise that an unacceptably long time is taken to process applications. There might be different interpretations of why that is so, but no one thinks that it is right that, in some cases, people have to wait years rather than months for their applications to be considered. Are we to believe that during that period, those who are entitled to be in this country as asylum seekers should be precluded by that process from obtaining employment, supporting themselves and obtaining housing? It is monstrous that, unless the amendment is accepted, asylum seekers will be denied housing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Brooke <span class='memberconstituency'>(City of London and Westminster, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not remotely suggest that the hon. Gentleman seeks to mislead the Committee, but, as he will recall, there is a six-month preclusion from employment; it is not precluded absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman will be aware that there is a preclusion from employment during that period. In such circumstances, if people were unable to obtain employment and, therefore, income, they would find themselves homeless and penniless without recourse. Several charitable and voluntary organisations have argued with conviction and passion that people seeking asylum and help should not be deemed ineligible for housing while their applications are being considered by the authorities. That is the purpose of the amendment.<br><br>
I accept entirely that, if it were found that an asylum seeker had no right to remain in the United Kingdom, he or she would have to leave their accommodation because the right to housing would be conditional on the right to remain in the United Kingdom. It is monstrous that asylum seekers are not entitled to housing if they are homeless while their applications are being considered. The amendment would right that wrong. Although I do not hold out much hope, perhaps the Minster will accept it. I do not feel confident about that, however, because wider Government policies are at stake. The amendment would in a small way redress a serious wrong that is currently being done to asylum seekers in Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is prescient about my response and about the reasons for it. As the Committee will know, the Asylum and Immigration Bill that is being considered in another place contains provisions that remove the entitlement to social housing from certain immigrants. Regulations under clause 124 will carry those restrictions forward into the new legislation and extend them to certain European Union nationals and persons failing a habitual residence test.<br><br>
Social housing is a valuable asset and it must go to people with the greatest long-term needs. The Government do not believe that there is a case for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 622</span>
saying that people who are in this country for a limited period, and on the understanding that they should have no recourse to public funds, should be entitled to such housing.<br><br>
That applies to asylum seekers as much as to other classes of immigrants here on limited leave. The Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993 establishes the principle, in the context of homelessness, that for so long as a person is an asylum seeker, his need for accommodation is only temporary. We shall be carrying forward the same theme. Of course, when someone is granted asylum or indefinite leave to remain, he can apply for social housing in the normal way. I cannot, therefore, accept amendment No. 377.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obviously disappointed with the Minister's answer, as I am sure is the hon. Member for Greenwich. Given the discussions that we have had in the House on such matters, I am not entirely surprised. Many organisations—particularly the Refugee Council—which look after asylum seekers are extremely concerned about what may happen to them when they are here legally and their cases are being considered.<br><br>
I regret that the Minister is not considering the matter more favourably. He said that when the matter has been dealt with and the asylum seekers are allowed to be here, they can go on the list. Their time of greatest need will be when they arrive here, are trying to have their case considered and have nowhere to live. What can be a greater need? I rest my case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are disappointed though not surprised by the Minister's response. There is no point in pursuing the debate any further. We shall press the amendment to a Division because we believe that asylum seekers are suffering a serious wrong and injustice. We want to show our disapproval of the way in which the Government are behaving.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 383, in page 69, line 29, at end insert—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0354">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 623</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) Any person who has a local connection with an authority, within the meaning of Section 156 below, is qualified to be allocated housing accommodation by that authority (referral of case to another local housing authority).".</p></blockquote>
I rise in the hope that the Minister may take a different view on this amendment. It is practical and would ensure that someone who had a local connection with another authority under the provisions of section 156 would be qualified to be allocated housing accommodation by that authority. It is designed to ensure that a person who has made an application in one area and has been referred to another under the procedures for referring applicants who have connections with other authorities, is entitled to be considered for permanent accommodation by the other authority.<br><br>
It would make nonsense of the procedures if that did not apply, and the Minister should accept the amendment in the interests of clarifying the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that there will be moments when I will wish I had accepted amendment No. 373, which the hon. Gentleman decided not to move, in the interests of clarifying the Bill. Here we have a case in point.<br><br>
I can see the logic of amendment No. 383, which would give anyone with a local connection in an area the right to go on the register. I think that it is a matter that we should leave to the discretion of the local authority. Giving an entitlement to anyone with a local connection might encourage authorities to pay less heed to the interests of other groups that have no foothold in the area but might have good reasons to move there.<br><br>
I undertake to consider the proposal and other options, such as ensuring that young single people, whom some authorities currently ignore, have a right to be considered for social housing, in the light of the consultation responses. It would ba a matter for regulations. The hon. Member for Greenwich and I are quite close in what we seek.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give us an assurance that when we eventually get to the regulations on the matter every individual will have a right to be on some housing register somewhere? That is the important point. It is possible that local authorities could all refuses to put a person on a register and that that person could end up not being registrable anywhere. That would be unfair. Does the Minister accept that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to reflect on that, in case it has implications beyong the obvious. My instinctive reply would be to say that the intention is as the hon. Gentleman suggests, but perhaps the hon. Gentleman will allow me to reflect on the phrases that he used. I shall make sure that he gets a detailed response. We know that some local authorities at the moment maintain exclusions from the register, so I shall reflect before giving a categoric response. That would be more prudent.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Greenwich and I agree on the intention behind the amendment. It is my intention, subject to the consultations, that the matter should be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 624</span>
dealt with through regulations. On the basis that the regulations will continue to exist, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment, but may I press the Minister briefly? It would make nonsense of the procedures for referring between authorities if people who were referred from one authority, to which they had made an application, to another authority, with which they were deemed by the first authority to have a local connection, and the second authority was not obliged to consider them for a housing allocation. That is the reason for the amendment, and I hope that the Minister will recognise that that position must be covered, because otherwise there could be a clear lacuna into which people could fall, with no prospect of being housed.<br><br>
The amendment seems self-evidently logical, which is why I pressed it in the hope that the Minister would accept it, rather than consigning the matter to regulations. However, if the Minister can give me the assurance that that possible gap will be filled, I shall be happy to propose that the amendment be withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that what the hon. Gentleman said was the intention. I just have a slight hesitation about giving a categorical response, as I have not been able to reflect clearly on the implications of what he said. Perhaps he will permit me to communicate with him in the usual way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 385, in
<br><blockquote><p>page 69, line 30, leave out from beginning to "a" in line 33.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 409, in
<br><blockquote><p>Clause 128, page 70, line 41, after "scheme")", insert "for identifying the classes of persons who are qualified to be allocated housing accommodation,".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, I have difficulty with amendment No. 385, which relates to the Secretary of State's regulatory powers. I shall say no more than I said on the previous occasion.<br><br>
Amendment No. 409 is designed to broaden the definition of an allocation scheme to include the rules for qualifying to be on the register, so that the subsequent clause, which requires publication, and which we shall debate later, extends to the qualification rules as well as to rules determining priority.<br><br>
Ostensibly the amendment is somewhat technical. However, it requires an authority to identify the classes of persons qualified to be allocated housing. From our viewpoint, it is useful in that it requires a more pro-active approach from the local authority. I hope that the Minister will be sympathetic towards that. I do not expect him to be especially sympathetic
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0355">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 625</span>
to amendment No. 385; judging by precedent, I imagine that he will be able to anticipate my moves on the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is acquiring remarkable powers of prescience. Amendment No. 385 would delete the provision that allows the Secretary of State to make regulations regarding who may and may not appear on a register. We are consulting about the ways in which that power might be used. At present we intend to use the power only to set the framework for the categories of persons who may and may not be allowed to appear. For the rest, we await the recommendations of the consultation paper about the extent to which entitlement to appear on a register would be at the housing authority's discretion.<br><br>
We accept that there may be a need to ensure that certain people have the entitlement to go on the register. We shall also use this power as a vehicle for our clearly stated policy of limiting entitlement to long-term social housing to people with a long-term need.<br><br>
Amendment No. 409 would have broadly a similar effect. It would make the allocation scheme the vehicle for deciding who is entitled to be considered for social housing, in contrast to the Bill, which gives the role to the housing register. The purpose of establishing the register is that it allows regulations relating to entitlement to appear on it. We agree that certain people should have the right to appear on it. Within the broad framework of rights to appear on the registery and of exclusions from it, that are listed in the regulations, it seems reasonable that a local authority should be entitled to set its own rules, and its entitlements for consideration for social housing, in the light of local circumstances.<br><br>
We have made it clear that there should be two distinct stages in the allocation process—being entered on the housing register and being given the appropriate degree of priority being the two consequences of this. The wording of the amendments blurs that distinction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cirencester and Tewkesbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has produced a helpful note about the European citizens who qualify. It states that unless such citizens meet the rights of residence, and the habitual residence test, they will not qualify. Will he confirm that for the record? Will he confirm also that in planning the number of housing units needed as part of social housing, he does not anticipate large numbers of people coming to this country from the European Union requiring social housing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I register my hon. Friend's questions and will make sure that I give him a detailed response.<br><br>
I was about to invite the hon. Member for Greenwich to withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am reluctant to take up that offer because I wonder what other interventions may come on all sorts of interesting issues.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 626</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. They might be interesting but they will not be in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what was exercising me, Mr. McWilliam. But, having rightly been called to account, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 387, in page 69, line 35, leave out subsections (4) and (5) and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(4) A local housing authority may allocate housing accommodation to two or more persons by means of a joint tenancy if one or more of them are qualifying persons.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:
<br><blockquote><p>No. 389, in page 69, line 36, leave out "jointly" and insert "by means of a joint tenancy".</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>No. 391, in page 69, line 39, leave out "jointly" and insert "by means of a joint tenancy".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This series of amendments is relatively technical in nature. Nevertheless the amendments have an important purpose: they relate to joint tenancies. I hope that the Minister will look upon them reasonably favourably.<br><br>
The first amendment would provide that a local authority may allocate housing accommodation to two or more persons by means of a joint tenancy if one or more are qualifying persons. This introduces an obvious dilemma: what happens if two people seek allocation of a joint tenancy but only one of them is qualified? Will they both be debarred? That would clearly be wrong. Even if only one of the parties qualified, they should be entitled to a joint tenancy.<br><br>
Amendment No. 389 clarifies that reference to the joint allocation of property by inserting the words
<br><blockquote><p>"by means of a joint tenancy"</p></blockquote>
in the relevant place. Amendment No. 391, another consequential amendment, also seeks to clarify matters.<br><br>
I hope that the purpose and intention of the amendments is clear and that the logic behind them is such as to commend it to the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should say straight away that I am not attracted by amendment No. 387, but I am prepared to consider amendments Nos. 389 and 391. To avoid confusion, I should make it clear that I am prepared to accept them as amendments to the Bill, not as regulations.<br><br>
Amendment No. 387 would remove from the Bill subsections (4) and (5) and insert the straightforward power to allocate housing to two or more persons by means of a joint tenancy, provided that one or more of them qualified. It is important to keep in mind what is likely to be in the regulations made under subsection (3). We issued a consultation paper in January and responses are due by 25 March. We have made clear our intention that the regulations should provide a framework within which authorities can set their own criteria of entitlement to appear on the housing register. The January consultation paper canvasses
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0356">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 627</span>
views about when and where the regulations should confer that entitlement. For example, we propose that people who have been accepted as homeless and who are to be rehoused under the two-year duty should have the right to appear on the register.<br><br>
We propose to exclude from entitlement to appear on the register only certain people from abroad. The Committee will realise from the terms of clause 124(5) that the Government are in favour of joint tenancies. They are an important part of efficient housing management. However, subsection (4) is important because, without it, a person from abroad in one of the six categories that I mentioned could be allocated social housing by another of the household. That would conflict with the Government's policy in relation to persons from abroad and would be inconsistent with recent legislation promoted by the Home Office and the Department of Social Security.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 389 and 391 would remove the word "jointly" from subsections (4) and (5) and put in its place the words
<br><blockquote><p>"by means of a joint tenancy".</p></blockquote>
I am not quite sure of the great significance of that, but I am prepared to consider carefully and sympathetically the merits of the proposed substitution if the hon. Gentleman agrees to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remain troubled. A number of people debarred under the rules referred to by the Minister will have come from abroad to join relatives entitled to be in this country and entitled to be allocated accommodation. The inference to be drawn from the Minister's proposal is that such a couple, who would normally expect to live together, would be denied the opportunity of moving into accommodation with a joint tenancy simply because one of them came from abroad, even though the other was entitled to be here. That seems rather unjust.<br><br>
However, I note that the Minister is more willing to be flexible over amendments Nos. 389 and 391. To avoid losing a possible positive response on those amendments, I shall bow to the inevitable. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 392, in page 69, line 40, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(6) In arriving at his decisions under subsection (2) as to which classes of persons should be prescribed as qualifying or non-qualifying persons the Secretary of State shall consult with those bodies he considers to be representative of registered social landlords.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following amendments: No. 414, in clause 128, page 71, line 4, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(3A) Before adopting or varying a scheme, a local housing authority shall make such arrangements as it considers appropriate for consultation with any social landlord to which it has addressed, or intends to address, in the following year, a request under section 131 of this Act.".</p></blockquote>
No. 419, in clause 129, page 71, line 16, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(4) Where the authority proposes to make an alteration to its scheme reflecting a major change of policy, it shall make such arrangements as it considers appropriate for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 628</span>
consultation with any social landlord to which it has addressed, or intends to address in the following year, a request under section 131 of this Act.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now come to an issue of consultation. Amendment No. 392 is entirely sensible, and amendments Nos. 414 and 419 are consequential, and effectively do the same thing later in the Bill. The amendments would add extra subsections that would mean that local authorities would have to consult about which classes of persons were qualified or not qualified to be allocated housing by the authority, and to consult other social landlords with whom the authority had nomination arrangements.<br><br>
Nomination arrangements are an important part of the way in which people are housed under current procedures, and it is clearly appropriate that where an authority has detailed nomination arrangements with a number of other housing associations and other social landlords, it should consult them before reaching decisions on those matters. There is no point in my taking any longer in moving the amendment: its purpose is self-evident, and it is to be hoped that its logic will appeal to the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not enthusiastic about amendment No. 392, but I will certainly consider amendments Nos. 414 and 419.<br><br>
I do not want to sound offhand when I say that we can occasionally have a surfeit of consultation. The Department once—this was before my time—found itself losing a High Court case on the grounds that it had over-consulted, that it had gone beyond the prescriptions for consultation. It lost the case on that technicality. From my own experience of the revenue support grant consultations, I am conscious that they are a most prescribed form of consultation. If we are not careful, we can find that we get something wrong and have to begin again not because of any ill-will but because a foot is put wrong in a technical sense. On the whole, I prefer to leave things to common sense.<br><br>
Amendment No. 414 would require a local authority, before adopting or varying an allocation scheme under clause 123, to consult any social landlord with which it proposed to co-operate. I recognise the intention of that amendment. It is right that local housing authorities should consult their social landlord partners before adopting or varying an allocation scheme, and I shall therefore consider that proposal.<br><br>
Amendment No. 419 would require a local housing authority that proposed to alter its allocation scheme to reflect a "major change of policy" first to consult its social landlord partners. Again, that suggestion is perfectly sensible. I will therefore reflect on those two amendments in a positive fashion, and invite the hon. Gentleman, having got two out of three, to desist with the lead amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Two out of three seems quite a good result and better than par for the course today. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

THE HOUSING REGISTER</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 393, in page 70, line 1, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>"for other purposes or maintained".</p></blockquote>
The amendment deals with the powers of local authorities to obtain and maintain information on the housing register. It would apply to the first lines of page 70 of the Bill, which says that an authority's housing register
<br><blockquote><p>"may, in particular, be kept as part of a register maintained for other purposes".</p></blockquote>
That is a strange concept. Either the housing register is a register that provides information about the needs of applicants for housing, and is used exclusively for that purpose, or it is not. I find it difficult to envisage circumstances in which the housing register would be kept as part of a register "maintained for other purposes". I invite the Minister to say what those other purposes might be.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Minister for Denton and Reddish is strong on civil liberties and such issues, and he will be only too well aware of the potential for abuse of a system in which a register that contained details of people's applications for housing could be used for other purposes. For example, it could be sold as a mailing list to commercial organisations, although I am not suggesting that that is in the Minister's mind. The wording simply says that it may be
<br><blockquote><p>"kept as part of a register maintained for other purposes".</p></blockquote>
That is extraordinary broad, and is potentially open to abuse. We regard it as improper and suggest that the appropriate arrangement would be to leave out reference to the "register maintained for other purposes", as the amendment would require.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister can throw light on the matter and put to rest our fears and anxieties that he is proposing to set up in business to sell details of people on housing registers to a variety of organisations with interests widely different from those with which the Committee is primarily concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This whole thing is much less sinister than the hon. Gentleman does not really suspect. I shall reflect on the wording, so that it can be made more precise and exclude some of his concern. The register is not, I hasten to say, about to be sold to a commercial traveller, nor it it about to be made available to constituency associations for canvessing purposes.<br><br>
The phrase "other purposes" is intended to refer to other housing purposes. Common housing registers, which are held between and run jointly by a local authority and one or more housing associations operating in the area, are becoming well established. They may contain the names of non-qualifying persons—for example, someone not eligible for local authority housing but eligible for the accommodation over which housing associations retain control, and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 630</span>
which is not part of a common allocation policy. Such people would, therefore, be caught by the restriction that the amendment would impose.<br><br>
Equally, some experts feel that the common register should not be regarded just as a waiting list for social housing but should be a wider register for housing need. It would be in keeping with the authority's strategic role to use the register to identify people interested in other housing alternatives, such as low-cost home ownership or private-sector renting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that at the moment a local authority can use such information while assessing housing need? Is there a need for such a provision to be in the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said to the hon. Member for Greenwich, the wording is a little loose, and I shall reflect on that. I shall take on board the hon. Lady's point about whether there is a well-established practice. I do not want to make an issue where none of us intend that an issue should arise.<br><br>
Hon. Members are concerned about privacy if the register is used as part of a document for other purposes, but the provisions on confidentiality in clause 127(2) will continue to apply. I hope that the hon. Member for Greenwich will feel that I have given him the reassurance that we have no nefarious purpose and that I will reflect on whether we need to revise the wording.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to make a long speech. It is important that the Government should protect the privacy of people who are on the list. There is, however, another side to the problem, which the Government should consider.<br><br>
One of the snags of being homeless is that one has no address. That has many implications and causes all sorts of problems—for example, in obtaining credit. In many local authorities, one needs an address to obtain local authority services. In Stockport, for instance, one cannot apply for an allotment unless one can prove that one has an address in Stockport. A homeless person probably does not want an allotment, but for a simple matter such as getting a library ticket, he must be able to produce an address to prove that he lives in Stockport.<br><br>
We should try to confer on homeless people some of those rights. A homeless person should not be denied the opportunity to use the library service. In getting the wording of the clause right, the Government should make it possible for someone who is registered as homeless to use the fact that he is on that register as a sort of address to qualify for certain local government services—not just libraries and allotments. The Minister made a bit of a joke about canvassing, but we should ensure that homeless people are entitled to a vote, whoever they decide to vote for.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's comments, as he should take the matter seriously. Before coming to the Committee today, I briefly attended a meeting about the use to which security camera videos can be put. There is increasing concern in society that more and more information about us is kept in all sorts of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0358">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 631</span>
places. We should ensure that our legislation reflects our concern about privacy, particularly for people in difficult circumstances who do not want any further problems. I look forward to the proposals that the Minister will present at a later stage</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the concerns of hon. Members. It may not be appropriate to give a French example on the day that we published the White Paper on the future of Europe, but there was a celebrated case in northern France where cameras were installed at a traffic light to monitor traffic flows. There was a great deal of concern about why traffic flows did not seem to improve. The cameras were positioned rather high and the flat immediately adjacent had recently been occupied by a newly married couple. The local police apparently spent more of their time watching what was happening inside than outside the flat. I cite that very French example to support the hon. Lady's concerns.<br><br>
I will re-examine the wording in the light of hon. Members' anxieties. I hope that I have laid to rest the general concern. The register is intended to be a sensible management tool for housing purposes. I will reflect on the concerns expressed in Committee and see whether we can produce tighter wording which defines the purpose with more precision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted by the Minister's parallel from France, which was skilfully designed to appeal even to his most Euro-sceptical colleague. It is an attractive feature of life on the continent.<br><br>
I shall rapidly bring myself back to order and return to the amendments. I entirely accept the Minister's point about the importance of joint registers where local authorities and housing associations agree a common allocation procedure or a common waiting list. We have no intention of thwarting such arrangements. Our concern is solely with the curiously open-ended wording of subsection (3). In the light of the Minister's undertaking to examine that and ensure that it would apply only to appropriate related purposes and not to the nefarious activities that might be envisaged, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not worry. "Other purposes" seems to me to mean any other purposes under the sun.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 394, in page 70, line 5, leave out from beginning to "the" in line 7.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 395, in page 70, line 5, leave out from "contain" to end of line 8 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>",in relation to any applicant, only such information as is relevant to the assessment of that applicant's housing need in accordance with the authority's allocation scheme.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once again, I am ambivalent about the outcome of the proposals as the first amendment strikes out the Secretary of State's powers to make regulations; if the amendment were accepted, it would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 632</span>
thwart some of our good work a few moments ago in getting the Minister to agree to use those regulatory powers to good effect. I therefore do not move amendment No. 394 with great enthusiasm. However, amendment No. 395 raises more important issues about the role of the local authority in including in the register only such information as is relevant to the assessment of the applicant's housing needs.<br><br>
The amendment picks up the theme of the hon. Member for Christchurch and of my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish, who are rightly concerned about the possible misuse of information in an age in which it is, sadly, all too readily available for a variety of purposes, not all of them proper and above board.<br><br>
Amendment No. 395 would make it absolutely clear that the authority may hold only such information as is relevant to determine the applicant's need for housing and therefore his or her entitlement to an allocation. Given the anxieties rightly expressed in the Committee and the fears that there might be abuse, I hope that the Minister will be sympathetic to the purpose of the amendment, although if he is, I have no doubt that he will say that it is best dealt with by the Secretary of State's regulation-making powers, which amendment No. 394 would knock out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's ambivalence is terrible to behold. I am sorry that we have led him down such a tortured path, but I hope that we can help him to escape from it without too much damage.<br><br>
Amendment No. 395 would restrict information held under the register to matters relating to the applicant's housing need. I am not sure what specific information the hon. Gentleman feels the register should not contain. I wonder about confining it to some ill-defined term such as housing need. I shall give an example: such a restriction could mean that a register could not contain information about an applicant's personal circumstances, for instance his ethnic background, which might be relevant in trying to create mixed communities when allocating housing. The Committee agrees that we want people to try to build workable communities, and certain information might be necessary to monitor race relations policy. I do not feel especially strongly about the matter; I am willing to consider whether there is a problem, but there are probably legitimate items in a register which are used for sensible management. I hope that we can find wording that embraces sensible information without allowing it to go too far.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept the Minister's point that there are good reasons for obtaining information that might not be strictly necessary for determining an applicant's priority but is necessary to determine whether the allocation scheme is operating fairly and in a non-discriminatory way. The Minister's example of ethnic records is a good example of precisely that information. Ethnicity would not necessarily determine priority, but it is extremely important to keep a watch on whether the system ensures that people are allocated housing irrespective of race. Therefore, I accept the Minister's offer to consider the

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 633</span>
purpose behind the amendment to avoid any misuse of information while allowing a wider use than would be permitted under the tight definition in amendment No. 395. As there is now no ambivalence, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 398 would achieve the fairly simple objective of ensuring that people who are refused the right to appear on the register have a right to have their case reviewed. I hope that the Minister will respond favourably to the amendment, which is important given the fact that the Government's intention under the Bill is to secure one route into housing. If that route were blocked and people were not allowed to get to the first stage—being on the register—the amendment would be crucial; it would allow people to become local authority tenants.<br><br>
Given that there is a right of review for people who are refused housing under the homelessness provisions in part VII, logically there should be a right of review for people who proceed through the registration route but who are blocked for whatever reasons the authority might have. Those reasons might be very good, but they should be explained to people and there should be a right of review.<br><br>
Amendment No. 405 deals with individuals who are removed from the register. It would give such people the right to be given the reasons for their removal and a right of review. If there were to be a review, the individual would be notified of the decision and the reasons for it. That is part of a clear and logical process and of an important set of rights for such individuals.<br><br>
Amendment No. 404 deals with subsection (5), which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"A local authority may remove a person from their housing register in such other circumstances as they think fit."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the Minister will explain which circumstances he and local authorities might have in mind. Subsection (4) states that if an individual requests removal from a register or if the authority believes that an individual has never qualified, or no longer qualifies, he or she can be removed. Other than the fact that a person did not qualify, no longer qualifies or wants to be removed, what reasons for removal can there be? No doubt the Minister will know the reasons an authority might have to remove an individual from the register.<br><br>
New clause 29 deals with the right to appeal to a county court if individuals are not satisfied that, despite the review procedure, their right to be on the register has not been properly taken into account by local authorities. Given the crucial importance of registering before accommodation can be offered, individuals should have the right for the courts to decide whether they should be on housing registers. That is especially so if people think that local authorities have not taken account of their circumstances, or that there has been maladministration. The courts should ultimately deal with such fundamental issues. We do not envisage that the right would be used frequently, but the possiblity should exist, if only to ensure that authorities give full and proper consideration to each individual wanting to be on the housing register for a particular area.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 635</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is concluding his remarks about new clause 29. In the earlier part of his speech, he perfectly reasonably represented the amendments as being intended to achieve equilibrium with certain later clauses. The hon. Gentleman did not make clear whether new clause 29 was intended to cover all cases or simply the cases that he alluded to in his comments about the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I read it, new clause 29 deals specifically with clause 126, and the right to be on the housing register. When drawing a parallel with the homeless route, I mentioned later clauses and said that clause 160 allows a review and that that right should also exist for people on the register. I am not aware that Bill gives people who are refused the homeless route the right to go to the county court. If new clause 29 is accepted, a similar right should be given homeless people when we come to part VII.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have flushed out the answer that I was seeking—that new clause 29 deals only with this part of the Bill. However, were it to be accepted, to achieve equilibrium with clause 160, it seems likely that the hon. Gentleman would adduce that another new clause would be needed to give the same rights. It is important that the Committee should be aware of that. It is not a double whammy, but the Committee should know that we are likely to be faced with another new clause before concluding our consideration of new clause 29.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is correct in his analysis that I am seeking to draw parallels, and equal rights for people in different circumstances. If people who query their exclusion from the register have the right to go to the county court, similar rights should exist for others who seek to challenge their exclusion from the homeless provisions—rights that they might otherwise have been entitled to under other provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments seek to formalise arrangements for refusing someone access to a housing register or removing his name from it. I understand the thinking behind the amendments, but they go too far for me to be able to accept them.<br><br>
Current legislation makes no reference to how local authorities should administer their waiting list arrangements. However, in discharging any administrative function, they are under a general duty to follow the precepts of administrative law; if they behave in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner they are open to challenge in the courts. Authorities running a waiting list will have in place procedures for reaching decisions and notifying people of them, and there will be informal channels of redress as well as formal ones.<br><br>
For those reasons, the Bill makes little reference to procedures to be adopted in entering or removing names from a register. The limited provisions we have made in clause 124—in particular, the provisions in subsections (4) and (5) as to the removal of a name from the register—are necessary because we have created a right for "qualifying persons" to go on the register. If they have a right to appear and remain on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 636</span>
the register, the clear corollary is that there must be some mechanism governing removal from the register, either if they cease to qualify or lose interest; a recent DoE study "Routes into local authority housing", found that more than a third of people shown on current local authority waiting lists were no longer contactable by the time the survey took place.<br><br>
Most local authorities have established procedures for the periodic updating of their registers, for example, by requiring applicants to indicate continued interest once a year. We intend to reflect such practices in regulations, ensuring that the individual's rights are propery safeguarded. We shall be consulting the local authority associations and the housing profession on the detail of the regulations.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 398 and 405 would establish formal procedures for notifying a person of a refusal to put his name on a register, or to delete it, together with reasons and the right of appeal. I see no need to formalise what should be good practice and we shall issue guidance to local authorities on the operation of this part of the Bill. We will draw their attention to the need to inform people of, and explain, their decision when required. The amendments are unnecessary.<br><br>
I fear that amendment No. 404 is unworkable. It implies that a person's name should not be removed from a housing register except with his consent. What happens if someone leaves the area and cannot be contacted? Does his name stay on the register permanently? What will be the impact if the authority has a policy that only persons resident in the area are to be "qualifying persons"? Does it still have to keep the person on its register, bearing in mind that if he is no longer a "qualifying person" he is no longer entitled to be allocated housing?<br><br>
The detailed review procedure set out in amendment No. 406 is not appropriate. Review procedures, such as we are proposing in clause 160 under the homelessness legislation, are appropriate for scrutinising decisions where, as we have admitted, a lot of discretion and judgment is involved. But that is not so in this case, where entitlement to appear on the register will almost invariably flow from straigtforward tests based on hard facts, for example, where someone lives, how long he has lived there, how old he is.<br><br>
I apply the same thinking in respect of the proposal to take a further appeal to the county court, as proposed in new clause 29. In entitlement to appear in the register, as opposed to priority in an allocation scheme, we are talking about matters of fact, which hardly need to be routinely exposed to the full court process with its attendant delays and costs.<br><br>
We must also consider the scope for creating mischief that the procedure might allow. Any person with no connection with an authority could, if he wished, apply to go on its register; when refused he could demand a review, and when that failed he could insist on taking the matter to the county court. We do not want such a procedure.<br><br>
If a person is aggrieved about an authority's decision in his case he has a range of alternative avenues of recourse. He could take the matter to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0361">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 637</span>
local government ombudsman, who already handles a large number of housing allocation cases, generally very speedily and at little cost to either party. At the limit, he could seek judicial review against the authority if he felt it could be demonstrated to be acting unreasonably.<br><br>
There are sufficient safeguards in place to ensure that the proper interest of the individual are protected. We do not want to tie local authorities down further in this matter. I cannot accept the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed with the Minister's response. He seems to have run out of his quota of reasonable consideration for the afternoon.<br><br>
The Opposition are proposing what should be good practice, as the Minister said. The local authorities will be issued with guidance in the hope that they will act appropriately, giving people reasons for being turned down, reviewing cases in appropriate circumstances and so on. If the Minister hopes that that is what local authorities, using best practice, will do, why not make it a requirement in the Bill? As I said, there is a parallel with the homelessness provisions and the right of review and the Minister responded by saying that local authorities had a lot of discretion in that respect. I agree that the issues are more complicated and more tests are involved, but that does not mean that there is no discretion in determining who should go on a housing register, Often, the conditions for going on a register are whether someone has lived in an area for a certain period, whether he works in the area and so on. Those facts must be verified. Does the person really work for a particular company and if so, how long has he worked there? Does he really reside at a certain address or is it an address of convenience? All those matters come into play in determining whether someone has the right to be on a local authority's register. If an authority forms a view about a set of circumstances and about whether someone has given correct information and, as a result, refuses to put him on the register, the individual has the right to be notified of that decision and to be told why the authority has taken it. They also have a right to have that decision reviewed. That seems to be natural justice. There can be an element of discretion, but an authority ought to explain how it has used discretion to the individual in question. I hope that every authority will be required to do that as a matter of good practice and that authorities will not simply be sent a list of guidelines that they may or may not choose to follow.<br><br>
6.30 pm<br><br>
I accept that some people simply disappear without a forwarding address, and that mail will come back. That happens in every review of people on the list, but if someone is taken off the list, an attempt should at least be made to tell them that that has happened and the reason for it. Again, that seems simply a matter of good practice.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 638</span>
I have not had an explanation from the Minister of the circumstances in which the following wording of clause 126(5) would apply:
<br><blockquote><p>"A local housing authority may remove a person from their housing register in such other circumstances as they think fit."</p></blockquote>
He said that someone could leave the area, but in that case, clause 126(4)(b) would come into play with the words
<br><blockquote><p>"is no longer such a person".</p></blockquote>
The person would not qualify because he or she did not live in the area, which is a condition of being on the list in many housing authority areas. I do not understand why clause 126(5) exists. We have had no explanation from the Minister of the circumstances in which an authority might see fit to use it to remove a person from a register.<br><br>
The Government intend to have only one route into local housing. If that route is blocked, there are issues of natural justice. People should be allowed to question decisions and be told why they were made. That is a fundamental point and I am sorry that the Minister has shown no willingness to consider any of the amendments. If he continues on that line, I shall push the point to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In preparing for the debate on these amendments, I intended to listen to the Minister closely because it seemed that the Opposition had a case. Those of us who represent inner city seats are familiar with how waiting lists can get into the most extraordinary muddle. People can be under the impression that they are on lists when, in fact, they have ceased to be on them. Having said that, I thought that the Minister made a perfectly reasonable case in response to the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) and I would support the Minister in a Division. However, there are practical issues on guidance that should be brought to the Minister's attention so that good practice is watertight, not porous.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief in dealing with the two principal amendments, Nos. 399 and 400, and the two others which deal with consultation.<br><br>
Amendment No. 399 requires an authority to assess whether people on its housing register are vulnerable and in need of support; amendment No. 400 contains a similar requirement for people who may need community care services; and both amendments require the authority to carry out an assessment of such needs. The case for doing that is self-evident. There is too much evidence of the failure to ensure proper co-ordination among housing, health and social services authorities over the provision of care and support for people who need assistance from the community care service or who are housed because of their vulnerability and require more than just a roof over their head. Such people need help and support to enable them to establish themselves in the community and lead a reasonable life. Amendments Nos. 399 and 400 therefore seek to ensure that authorities look out for all such cases and co-operate closely with the relevant social service authorities and, where relevant, with the appropriate voluntary organisations, to ensure a proper and full assessment of people's needs.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 415 and 420 simply require local authorities to consult social service authorities and health authorities before adopting or varying a scheme for allocation of social housing so that those authorities have an opportunity to comment on the scheme, which is appropriate. The amendments are sensible and practical and would help ensure that difficult cases where people need care and support are identified at an early stage so that appropriate

arrangements can be made in good time. I hope that the Minister will see the good sense behind the amendments, even if he suggests that their proposals should be relegated to regulations.</span></p>
<p>[MR. JOHN MCWILLIAM <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that guidance on those matters exists. Of course local housing authorities must work with social service departments in addressing the needs of community care clients and vulnerable people.<br><br>
Amendment No. 399 seeks to impose a general duty on local authorities to assess an applicant's individual housing needs, which may be more than is needed in the majority of general needs housing applications. Where special needs are identified, the assessment is best shared with social service authorities, which have the expertise in that area. Section 47 of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 already provides for social services authorities to involve housing authorities in a joint needs assessment. I therefore doubt that the extra provision that Amendment No. 400 proposes is required in housing legislation. The Committee will be aware that in the recent consultation paper on allocations we propose that housing authorities be required to give special priority to persons with physical or learning disabilities, or severe mental illness, who could not reasonably be expected to find suitable accommodation for themselves.<br><br>
Amendment No. 415 would require a local authority, before adopting or varying an allocation scheme under clause 128, to consult the social services and health authorities operating in its area. Local housing authorities already keep in close contact with those authorities which is a matter of good management practice and we shall cover it in our guidance on part VI.<br><br>
Amendment No. 420 would require a local housing authority that proposed to alter its allocation scheme to reflect a major change of policy first to consult the social services and health authorities operating in its area. As the hon. Member for Greenwich said, that is a matter of good practice under the existing guidance and I shall ensure that the guidance adequately covers such consultation. People have established much good practice in that field and we need to ensure that it is generally followed by local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that helpful response. I am beginning to think that in this age of contract culture, we should start submitting consultancy bills to the Government for the number of good proposals that we have made, which they now appear to be taking on board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would respond by sending the hon. Gentleman a bill for all the redrafting that we have had to do to accommodate his amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is confusing input and output; we are concerned with output. The quality of our advice is such that it will undoubtedly lead to better output than would have been the case had we not moved our amendments. I do not want to go further down that route. I am grateful to the Minister

for his helpful offer to take on board the substance of our proposal. With that in mind, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 401, in page 70, line 14, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) The local authority shall have a duty to undertake a general assessment of the housing requirements of a person who is to appear on the register and where that assessment identifies that the person or a member of their household is disabled and has specific housing, support or care needs relating to his disability or to the physical accessibility of either the available property or the location in which it is situated, a full individual evaluation of the person's housing needs shall be undertaken.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 403, in page 70, line 14, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2B) A local housing authority undertaking a full individual evaluation of a disabled person's housing needs shall ensure that it includes the requirements for accessibility of the relevant property and of the local area, any provision for particular equipment or adaptations which may be required, the long term needs of the person, any requirement for care or support and other issues relevant to the individual, such as access to transport or parking; and the local authority may have regard to any guidance issued from time to time by the Secretary of State concerning such assessment procedures.".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 407, in page 70, line 27, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(7) Local housing authorities shall be under a duty to work in conjunction with social service authorities and other relevant welfare organisations when undertaking housing assessments of people with disabilities and to undertake joint assessments with social services authorities when requested by the individual being assessed or their parent or guardian if they are under 18 years of age.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments follow a similar pattern to the previous group, in this case with respect to people with physical disabilities or problems of accessibility with their property.<br><br>
There is widespread concern among disabled people's organisations that in the assessment procedures, the needs of people with disabilities are not always adequately taken into account. We have had evidence from a variety of organisations, many of which have been assiduous in bringing cases to our attention and helping us with briefings before the Bill. It would be wrong to single out any of the disability organisations individually, but I should like to pay tribute to those that have worked hard and conscientiously to draw to our attention the needs of people with disabilities.<br><br>
The amendments would ensure that local authorities have proper regard to the needs of people with disabilities for appropriate housing. The aim is good practice and I have little doubt that the Minister, if he is minded to accept the amendments' purpose, will seek to incorporate them in regulations. I will not even consider charging him a fee for the good idea. I hope that he will agree with their purpose and will ensure
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 642</span>
that regulations appropriately reflect the need for local authorities to make adequate provision to meet the needs of people with disabilities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are parallel amendments to the group that we have just dealt with and in the interests of consistency, they require the same response. We will consider those matters carefully in the guidance.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman will recognise, many people do not have a major disability, but it handicaps them none the less. We need to ensure that authorities can deal appropriately with people's level of disability, rather than simply categorising disabled people as a single group. Again, that calls for sensitivity, which we can bring to advice in the guidance. I undertake to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to make just one point for the Minister to bear in mind when he considers these matters. There is considerable concern among many of the disability groups that have lobbied us on the issue that many local authorities have not done much research into the level of need of people who are disabled. That is an important consideration, and I hope that the Minister will take it into account when he issues guidance to local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In line with my response to the previous set of amendments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 402, in page 70, line 21, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>"it appears to them that".</p></blockquote>
This brings us on to a slightly different aspect of clause 126—the provision for a local authority to have the power to remove people from their housing registers in certain circumstances. As it stands, the clause provides that an authority
<br><blockquote><p>"shall remove a person from their housing register if … he requests them to do so, or…it appears to them that he has never been a qualifying person or is no longer such a person."</p></blockquote>
6.45 pm<br><br>
That is likely to apply particularly to those who are debarred by the rulings on immigrants, asylum seekers and other such people. It is wrong that people should lose their entitlement to housing simply because the local authority presumes that they have never been a qualifying person.<br><br>
We require a greater degree of certainty and propose that the words "it appears to them" be deleted. The amendment would require the housing authority to remove a person from the register if he requests it to do so or if he is no longer or has never been a qualifying person. That requires a higher burden of proof, but it is appropriate and necessary. The clause is not discretionary, and the authority is not free to decide whether to leave a person on the register—it must remove him if the test is satisfied. The test should, therefore, be reasonably proper and not a matter of conjecture. The authority should be satisfied that the person is not eligible, and I hope that the Minister agrees.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0364">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 643</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Housing authorities are charged with allocating housing to qualifying persons—those eligible to appear on the register. When an authority admists a person to the register, it will form a view of his or her entitlement on the best available evidence. If new information subsequently leads it to revise its view, it must be in a position to remove the name.<br><br>
The amendment would impose a stronger test for the removal of a name from the register than is required to place a name on it. That does not make sense, and there must be a symmetry between the two processes. Authorities would otherwise be reluctant to enter the names of people with uncertain qualification because it might then be difficult to remove them. I cannot therefore, accept the amendment and would ask the Committee to resist it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister takes that view. He accepts that the amendment's purpose is to apply a stronger test. We are dealing not with the local authority's power but with its duty to remove a person from the register. It would be a severe and far-reaching decision simply to strike off a person's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 644</span>
entitlement to housing on the basis of conjecture and without the requirement that the authority should be satisfied.<br><br>
If the matter is a question of symmetry, as the Minister argues, the symmetry should apply both ways. The authority should be satisfied that someone who seeks to register is entitled to do so. Irrespective of that, we should give people a reasonable opportunity not to have their names removed from the register.<br><br>
I am disappointed at the Minister's response, but in view of the time and the need to turn our attentions to other matters, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
