<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Sykes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Scarborough)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Winterton. May I declare an interest in this morning's proceedings? I am a landlord and a tenant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for that point of order. I am sure that the Committee has noted it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Ashby <span class='memberconstituency'>(North-West Leicestershire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mrs. Winterton. It had not occurred to me that, as a tenant, I had to declare an interest. However, I most certainly do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Fine. I think that spring has got to the Committee today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Elletson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Blackpool, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mrs. Winterton. May I also declare an interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Raynsford <span class='memberconstituency'>(Greenwich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Winterton. Once again the gremlins appear to have got at the record. At the start of Thursday morning's sitting, my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) said that three extra noughts had been added to a figure that he quoted. I have not suffered to the same degree, but an extra nought has transformed the 600,000 to which HMOs I referred in column 316 to 6 million HMOs. None of us believes that there are that many HMOs. I hope that the record will be corrected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Raynsford. The record will be corrected. Noughts have been sprinkled around like confetti.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Winterton. Will you consider having a new selection of amendments for this afternoon's sitting? You will remember that I pursued the point that starred amendments were historically selected for afternoon sittings, assuming that they were in order and met the other criteria for which the Chair looks. There is a starred amendment on today's amendment paper, to which many Opposition members would like an opportunity to speak. There are two ways in which we can achieve that end: you could select the amendment for this afternoon's sitting as the star would be removed; alternatively, we could make very slow progress this morning to ensure that it is not reached until Thursday morning. Given the good spirit in which the Committee worked, the latter does not seem a particularly good way to proceed.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 322</span>
Various people have looked at the records, and I understand that there is clear evidence that, historically, a star is removed from an amendment tabled in the morning and that, therefore, the amendment is selectable in the afternoon. I understand that there is evidence that that practice has not been followed for the past two or three years. If the policy has been changed in that way, it should have been done for a very good reason. I suggest that there are problems. This difficult Bill has been taken in a variety of orders and it is difficult for people outside to keep up with the way in which the Committee is dealing with it and to suggest amendments to hon. Members. Therefore, it is not unreasonable for someone to present an amendment to a northern Member on a Friday, or to other Members on a Monday, and for it to have the two days clear so that it can be printed on the amendment paper. In those circumstances, and especially in the interests of people outside, we should make efforts to ensure that when a starred amendment raises a matter of considerable principle, as the one on the amendment paper does, it should be selectable. I realise that it will be a matter—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Mr. Bennett, I have listened most carefully to everything that you have had to say. As you will recall, I gave a firm ruling on this matter a couple of sittings, if not a couple of weeks, ago. I ask you to reflect upon what I said then. I shall make a further ruling this afternoon. I have inquired into this matter and, although the hon. Gentleman's name is Mr. Bennett, I am not proud and I hope that he has no prejudice and that we shall get on and make good progress. I have already made a firm ruling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mrs. Winterton. I understood that the Chair would give this matter some further thought. I hope you will—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not prepared to sit down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will you please resume your seat?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Under protest. It is very unfair to change the procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I should be grateful, Mr. Bennett, if you would resume your seat. We should now make progress.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 323</span>
This is an important amendment. It arises out of the Sheffield city council v. Barnes case, which has affected how a number of local authorities deal with houses in multiple occupation. The Bill amends previous legislation. The subject of houses in multiple occupation forms the basis of all our deliberations. The definitions of HMOs revolves around the definition of a household. We have to go back to section 345 of the Housing Act 1985 to find that a house in multiple occupation is
<br><blockquote><p>"a house which is occupied by persons who do not form a single household."</p></blockquote>
That might seem fairly simple, but what does "single household" mean? No further definition is given in the 1985 Act or in the Bill. Nevertheless, that definition of a house in multiple occupation is the basis for the registration schemes and the exemptions that we have discussed.<br><br>
In the past, it has been left to the Department of the Environment to advise local authorities. Comprehensive and detailed advice is contained in the Department's guidance notes. Indeed, paragraph 2.2 makes the obvious statement that it may sometime be difficult to tell whether a property is a house in multiple occupation. When considering the Sheffield court case, that is the understatement of the year. It is often exceedingly difficult to determine when a house is in multiple occupation.<br><br>
Local authorities are asked to have regard to the mode of living test—how a house is occupied by those who live in it, and how they share the household activities. Local authorities have to decide whether the occupants cook together, whether they use the same washing facilities, whether they eat together, and whether cleaning is shared. How that can be established with any degree of certainty is far from clear, as courts have found when asked to decide such matters. Anyone who knows about student households will understand that when one comes to define such activities as cooking, washing and cleaning, household arrangements do not conform to a stable pattern, but fluctuate from time to time.<br><br>
Like many local authorities, Sheffield city council had assumed, as advised by the Department of the Environment, that those were issues that they should consider when defining HMOs and deciding whether a house should be included in the registration scheme and be subject to the scheme's controls. However, as the officers of Sheffield city council found, the definition is not adequate and has caused enormous problems.<br><br>
In May 1992, the council served notice on a property that was believed to be a house in multiple occupation. It was occupied by five individuals who led disparate lifestyles—cooking and eating separately, having no common purse, not socialising together, spending most of the time in their own rooms and being unaware of each other's whereabouts. The council believed that it was a house in multiple occupation and took action against the landlord. The landlord contested the claim, and the case ultimately went to appeal and was heard by the Master of the Rolls, Sir Thomas Bingham. He effectively found that, while the mode of living test was one that the local authority should have applied, many other issues were involved, such as origin of tenancy, who took responsibility for the whole house, whether there were
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 324</span>
locks on doors, who was responsible for filling vacancies, who allocated rooms and the size of the establishment. Mode of living was only one of nine issues to be considered.<br><br>
That approach was different to that which Sheffield and many other councils had taken. They had thought that mode of living was the key test for shared student households, in particular, when defining whether people were living as a single household. The case was complicated—some male students had previously lived in the property and a group of female students moved in the following year, as frequently happens in student households. In summing up, Sir Thomas Bingham said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is inherent in student life that different students will come and go at different times and that groups will vary in their habits so far as sharing expenses and generally mucking in are concerned, and on the facts of this particular case there is nothing in the way in which the girl students ran the house which leads me to think that they were not one household, all the other indications to my mind showing that they were."</p></blockquote>
In fact, the girl students led a far more disparate lifestyle and were more separate in their arrangements than the male students who previously occupied the property. The Master of the Rolls said:
<br><blockquote><p>"On the facts here it is apparent that the girl students lived rather more independent existences than the boys did. They tended to shop and cook for themselves, to keep their own supplies of food in the kitchen, and to have no very clear plans for a common purse beyond sharing, at least in theory, the costs of electricity."</p></blockquote>
That was the arrangement that the Master of the Rolls believed existed, but he did not conclude that the house was in multiple occupation. That is a matter of great concern.<br><br>
The environmental health officers dealing with the case in Sheffield said of the summary:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is clear from reading it that the situation at the house in question was a fairly typical student shared house, the kind of which is repeated all over England and Wales in university and college towns and cities. It is also the type typically classified as Category B by the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health's categorisation of HMOs."</p></blockquote>
The authority knows of 3,000 such houses in Sheffield. The officers continue:
<br><blockquote><p>"So it was seen that the mode of living factors carried significant weight in concluding whether a group of tenants formed a household or not."</p></blockquote>
That was the initial view of Sheffield officers as result of the court case. The officers also said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is important to recognise…what the purpose of HMO legislation was. Clearly the need for it was, and is, as a result of the recognition that certain types of accommodation, because of the way in which it is occupied, provide unacceptable health and safety risks to the occupants."</p></blockquote>
Multiple cooking and use of facilities, and so on, especially when people in a house are not aware of each other's activities, lead to greater fire risks and the other dangers that we have discussed.<br><br>
The officers continued that, in the case of Sheffield city council <i>v.</i> Barnes,
<br><blockquote><p>"it is seen that the group occupying the house had virtually no such relationship. They were almost totally disparate, and because of this mode of occupancy, it is contended that such a group are indeed within the highest risk category of shared house occupants."</p></blockquote>
That is important: although such groups are in the highest risk category of shared house occupants, as the law stands because of that judgment they are not regarded as living in houses in multiple occupation, which are subject to registration.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0188">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 325</span>
I mentioned that Sheffield city council knows of 3,000 such houses in the city. It believes that only between 300 and 500 of them will still fall under the definition of houses in multiple occupation, if the precedent set by the case is allowed to stand. Before anyone thinks that that is special pleading for Sheffield, it is not a problem just for that city. Clearly, the case received publicity in Sheffield, but other council officers are already telling me that landlords are saying, "We will not take any notice of you or comply with any orders. Our houses are not in multiple occupation. The case law stands. Take us to court if you want, because we now think that we can win."<br><br>
That is a serious problem. Other landlords have picked up on the case and are saying, "We are no longer covered by the law; take us to court." Councils now consider that, in the majority of cases in which they previously believed that houses were in multiple occupation, they would now lose because of the Barnes judgment. The environmental health officers involved in the case in Sheffield concluded:
<br><blockquote><p>"In summary, the effects of the ruling are to de-classify from HMO status a vast number of shared houses which pose significant health and safety risks to their occupants."</p></blockquote>
When Sheffield city council wrote to other local authorities and organisations such as student unions, it received 160 letters of support all over the country. Many organisations have contributed towards the court case because they were so worried by it. Wycombe district council said that there is
<br><blockquote><p>"a real need for the law to be clear on the status of shared properties which are occupied by students."</p></blockquote>
West Somerset district council said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We have already been approached by the owner of a House in Multiple Occupation… containing five separate lettings stating that the property is no longer a HMO based on the above judgement."</p></blockquote>
So the news of the judgment is spreading and authorities are facing real difficulties.<br><br>
Canterbury city council said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The decision of the Court of Appeal seems perverse, to say the least, but the implications are horrendous."</p></blockquote>
Brighton borough council believes that 2,500 properties in the town will be affected by the judgment.<br><br>
Perhaps one of the most startling comments was:
<br><blockquote><p>"Quite why the Court of Appeal thought it appropriate to condemn the persons in that house and others in similar situations to high levels of personal risk and to conditions which are more akin to Victorian rookeries than to what should be achieved as the 21st century approaches is beyond me."</p></blockquote>
Those are the words of Brent council—a Conservative council.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
I accept that the wording of the amendment that I tabled to raise the issue may be subject to comments from Ministers, and I am not saying that I have got the wording right. The Institution of Environmental Health Officers has tried to find an appropriate form of wording, but I am not saying that that is easy. It might be possible to word the amendment negatively, so that it says that there would be no single household if people did not leave together as a family unit at the end of a tenancy.<br><br>
What I am saying is that the matter is important. HMOs, as understood by people in the street and most Committee members, pose serious problems. Occupants
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 326</span>
sharing HMOs face many risks, especially when they are students, who, because of their lifestyles and the lack of close relationships with each other, may not be aware of each other's activities, which can lead to fire risks and the other matters that I mentioned. We can discuss registration schemes and control of local authority arrangements, but if we cannot define a single household in such a way as to remove the problems that arise from the Sheffield city council v. Barnes case, much of our discussion will be fruitless and we will not succeed in protecting people in such circumstances, as the case removes powers from local authorities to take appropriate action.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister accepts that the issue is serious and that he will respond positively and ask the Government to find a form of words that will deal with the problems that I have raised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. James Clappison)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will have listened with interest to the comments of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts). He made an interesting, even valiant, attempt to deal with the problem of defining a house in multiple occupation, which, as he rightly said, is the starting point for what we are considering. He was also characteristically modest and sensible in accepting that there may be problems inherent in the amendment that he tabled to raise the matter.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman gave a clear and in many ways fair exposition of the present position. I must take issue with him on several points, but he was right to take the matter as the starting point and he was also right in the way in which he considered the definition of HMO, which according to the law is simply a house that is not in single occupation.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman referred at some length to the judgment on the Sheffield case. I entirely accept that that is of considerable interest in Sheffield—to students and the local authority—and to local authorities elsewhere. However, he went slightly astray by implying that the judgment was a novel interpretation of the legislative provisions and that it had a novel effect. It is clear from the judgment that the Court of Appeal, under Sir Thomas Bingham, was relying on established case law to consider the problem of what is and what is not a single household.<br><br>
The Court of Appeal quoted with approval the judgment of Lord Hailsham in the House of Lords in the case of Simmons v. Pizzey in 1979. The starting point of Sir Thomas's analysis was a passage from that judgement and it may assist the Committee if I quote from it. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The most germane passage is to be found in the speech of Lord Hailsham at page 59F where, having referred to various dictionary definitions and also definitions to be found in a number of authorities, he said: 'I do not find any of these references particularly helpful except to make clear to me what I would have supposed in any case that both the expression "household" and membership of it is a question of fact and degree, there being no certain indicia the presence or absence of any of which is by itself conclusive.'"</p></blockquote>
The question of what is a single household is the starting point. It is a matter of fact and degree. The hon. Gentleman explained the various considerations which the Court of Appeal applied to the case in Sheffield when it explored the factual circumstances to see whether it was a single household. I shall not reiterate them, but they are contained in the judgement. Those common sense considerations would be understandable to members of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0189">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 327</span>
the public, such as the number of people in the household, the length of time that they occupied the house, how the household came together, the extent of shared facility and the extent of responsibility for the common parts and so on. They are commonsense ways in which to decide whether it was a matter of fact and degree that a house was a single household or a house in multiple occupation.<br><br>
I submit to the Committee that there are many difficulties when considering individual cases to see whether it was a matter of fact and degree that the house was a single household. But difficulties arise when applying a single test, to incorporate all possible circumstances, to find out whether a household is a single household, which the hon. Member for Attercliffe accepted applied to the amendment. Its underlying sentiment was to deal with matters involving students. However, the amendment would apply that test to every conceivable circumstance. It is the only way in which it would permit a court to determine what is a single household. It would produce some results, which the Committee as well as members of the public might consider to be odd.<br><br>
A couple could be living together at a parental home and then decide to set up home together—as many couples do. Under the amendment, they would be regarded as people who had not been living together prior to the occupation of their new home. Therefore, apparently they would be living in a house of multiple occupation. That interpretation is clearly arguable under the amendment. The amendment could produce many other results. When considering intention, it is always difficult to know whether people intend to live together. It might be difficult for members of a household to know their future intentions.<br><br>
The amendment covers future intention. As part of its definition, people who would make up a single household are people who intend to live together when they cease to occupy the house in question. An example comes to mind: I apologise for it being a literary example, but you, Mrs. Winterton, mentioned "Pride and Prejudice" earlier. Let us consider Mr. and Mrs. Bennett who are living in their lovely country home with their many eligible daughters. If asked about their future intentions, I am sure that the daughters would not say that it was their intention to live together as a household unit when they leave their lovely country home. However, if the hon. Gentleman's amendment were applied to such circumstances, their house would have been a house in multiple occupation, something that would surprise Mrs. Bennett.<br><br>
Various results could be produced from the amendment. Notwithstanding what the hon. Gentleman said, the present approach of the courts is clear. The various factors that they consider are well established and can be applied as a matter of common sense when considering individual cases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Under-Secretary's point. I am sure that he can find cases when strict definitions would classify as houses in multiple occupation those properties that clearly are not. My worry, however, is that because of the court judgment, properties that everyone would regard as HMOs will not be able to be so classified in future, as the courts will not have the necessary powers. Local authorities trying to deal with the legislation are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 328</span>
worried that landlords will start to alter the way in which their households are established and run, to ensure that they do not conform with the test that the Master of the Rolls applied in that case.<br><br>
Landlords will start to put locks on doors. They will try to make out that the individual units of a house are separate. They will start to insist that tenants come as a group, which is easily done when five individuals go to the accommodation bureau of a university as new students and are sent en bloc to a particular house, although they have no common interest. They may be told that they must find a replacement if one of them leaves, or that they must arrange for the cleaning of the shared parts. Those are aspects of the test that Sir Thomas Bingham applied and from which he concluded that, because they were met in a certain way, the house was not a house in multiple occupation, even though it was exactly the sort of house that should concern us.<br><br>
My worry is that, as information about that court case spreads, landlords will not merely contest the decisions of local authorities, but will start to alter their letting arrangements in such a way that they will have a better chance of contesting the local authority's right to take action against such properties.<br><br>
I shall not press the amendment to a Division, as I accept that there are problems with it. But I am unhappy that the Government seem inclined to sit back and say that the courts will resolve the matter. If neither the Committee nor the Government can produce a definition of a house in multiple occupation, it will surely be a continuing problem for the courts to do so and for local authorities to second-guess how the courts may define it in future. As a result, the tenants of houses that ought to be so classified and controlled will be exposed to the real risks from which we should be protecting them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made a powerful case and has highlighted the extent to which the definitions of multi-occupied houses are inadequate. During our debates last week we came back again and again to the problems of definition and scope and to the risk that properties that are unsatisfactory in various way will not be subject to the controls that we all believe are essential.<br><br>
Like my hon. Friend, I do not propose to press the amendment, but it is right that we should serve notice on the Government that we come away from the debates on this part of the Bill with a feeling of sadness that the framework for control over HMOs, which should be in place, will not be. We will almost certainly have to revisit the issue in the very near future.<br><br>
We will probably go on debating the definition of multi-occupied houses for a long time. I had a little insight over the weekend. The Minister quoted last week from "Henry IV Part I". I could not resist refreshing my memory of that play and I found a splendid 15th-century foretaste of what we have been debating in a passage in act 2, scene 1, where a carrier comments:
<br><blockquote><p>"I think this is the most villainous house in all London road for fleas".</p></blockquote>
What was the case in 15th-century London is still the case in 20th-century London and, if effective action is not taken to control those properties, there will still be equivalents in 21st-century London. We must stamp on

them. That is why we will return to the issue with a national mandatory licensing scheme for multi-occupied houses.</span></p>

REGISTRATION SCHEMES: SPECIAL CONTROL PROVISIONS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><br><blockquote><p>'.—(1) In Part XI of the Housing Act 1985 (houses in multiple occupation), after section 38A (inserted by section 63 above) insert—</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>"Special control provisions.</i>
<br><blockquote><p>348B.—(1) A registration scheme which contains control provisions may also contain special control provisions, that is, provisions for preventing houses in multiple occupation, by reason of their existence or the behaviour of their residents, from adversely affecting the amenity or character of the area in which they are situated.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2) Special control provisions may provide for the refusal or revocation of registration, for reducing the number of households or persons for which a house is registered and for imposing conditions of registration.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(3) The conditions of registration may include conditions relating to the management of the house or the behaviour of its occupants.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(4) Special control provisions may authorise the revocation of registration in the case of—
<ol>
<li>occupation of the house by more households or persons than the registration permits, or</li>
<li>a breach of any condition imposed in pursuance of the special control provisions,</li></ol>
which is due to a relevant management failure.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(5) Special control provisions shall not authorise the refusal of—
<ol>
<li>an application for first registration of a house which has been in operation as a house in multiple occupation since before the introduction by the local housing authority of a registration scheme with special control provisions, or</li>
<li>any application for renewal of registration of a house previously registered under such a scheme,</li></ol>
unless there has been a relevant management failure.</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 330</span>
<br><blockquote><p>(6) Special control provisions may provide that in any other case where an application is made for first registration of a house the local housing authority may take into account the number of houses in multiple occupation in the vicinity in deciding whether to permit or refuse registration.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Special control provisions: general provisions as to decisions and appeals.</i>
<br><blockquote><p>348C.—(1) Special control provisions shall provide that the local housing authority shall give a written statement of their reasons to the applicant where they refuse to grant his application for first registration, or for a renewal or variation of a registration, or impose conditions of registration on such an application.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2) Special control provisions shall provide that the authority shall give written notice to the person having control of the house and the person managing it of any decision by the authority—
<ol>
<li>to vary the conditions of registration (otherwise than on an application to which subsection (1) applies), or</li>
<li>to revoke the registration of the house,</li></ol>
and at the same time give them a written statement of the authority's reasons.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(3) Where in accordance with special control provisions the local housing authority—
<ol>
<li>notify an applicant that they refuse to grant his application for first registration or for the renewal or variation of a registration,</li>
<li>notify such an applicant of the imposition of conditions of registration, or</li>
<li>give notice to the person having control or the person managing the house of any such decision as is mentioned in subsection (2),</li></ol>
that person may, within 21 days of being so notified, or such longer period as the authority may in writing allow, appeal to the county court.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(4) If on appeal it appears to the court—
<ol>
<li>that there has been any informality, defect or error in, or in connection with, the authority's decision, or</li>
<li>that the authority acted unreasonably,</li></ol>
the court may reverse or vary the decision of the authority.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(5) In so far as an appeal is based on the ground mentioned in subsection (4)(a), the courts shall dismiss the appeal if it is satisfied that the informality, defect or error was not a material one.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(6) Where the decision of the authority was a refusal—
<ol>
<li>to grant an application for first registration of a house, or</li>
<li>for the renewal or variation of the registration,</li></ol>
the court may direct the authority to grant the application as made or as varied in such manner as the court may direct.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Special control provisions: occupancy directions.</i>
<br><blockquote><p>348D.—(1) Special control provisions may provide that where the local housing authority decide that the registration of a house should be revoked the authority may direct that the level of occupation of the house be reduced, within such period of not less than 28 days as they may direct, to a level such that (in accordance with section 346(2)) the registration scheme does not apply.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Such a direction is referred to in this Part as an "occupancy direction".</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2) Special control provisions shall provide that the authority shall only make an occupancy direction if it appears to the authority that there has been a relevant management failure resulting in a serious adverse effect on the amenity or character of the area in which the house is situated.</p></blockquote>

<br><blockquote><p>(3) In considering whether to make an occupancy direction the authority shall take into account the interests of the occupants of the house and the person having control of the house as well as the interests of local residents and businesses.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(4) Special control provisions may require the person having control of the house, and the person managing it, to take all reasonably practicable steps to comply with an occupancy direction.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(5) Nothing in the Rents Acts or Part I of the Housing Act 1988 prevents possession being obtained by any person in order to comply with an occupancy direction.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(6) Nothing in this section affects any liability in respect of any other contravention or failure to comply with control provisions or special control provisions.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Special control provisions: decisions and appeals relating to occupancy directions.</i></p>
<p><br><blockquote><p>348E.—(1) Special control provisions shall provide that where the local housing authority make an occupancy direction in respect of a house they shall give written notice of the direction to the person having control of the house and the person managing it and at the same time give them a written statement of the authority's reasons.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2) A person aggrieved by an occupancy direction may, within 21 days after the date of the service of notice as mentioned in subsection (1), appeal to the county court.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(3) If on appeal it appears to the court—
<ol>
<li>that there has been any informality, defector or error in, or in connection with, the authority's decision, or</li>
<li>that the authority acted unreasonably,</li></ol>
the court may make such order either confirming, quashing or varying the notice as it thinks fit.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(4) In so far as an appeal is based on the ground mentioned in subsection (3)(a), the court shall dismiss the appeal if it is satisfied that the informality, defect or error was not a material one.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(5) If an appeal is brought the direction does not become operative until—
<ol>
<li>a decision on the appeal confirming the direction (with or without variation) is given and the period within which an appeal to the Court of Appeal may be brought expires without any such appeal having been brought, or</li>
<li>if a further appeal to the Court of Appeal is brought, a decision on that appeal is given confirming the direction (with or without variation).</li></ol></p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(6) For this purpose the withdrawal of an appeal has the same effect as a decision confirming the direction or decision appealed against.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Special control provisions: "relevant management failure".</i></p>
<p><br><blockquote><p>348F. A "relevant management failure" for the purposes of sections 348B to 348E (special control provisions) means a failure on the part of the person having control of, or the person managing, a house in multiple occupation to take such steps as are reasonably practicable to prevent the existence of the house or the behaviour of its residents from adversely affecting the amenity or character of the area in which the house is situated, or to reduce any such adverse effect.".'.</p></blockquote></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have now reached part V of the Bill, jumping over parts III and IV to which we shall return later.<br><br>
Part V of the Bill deals with anti-social behaviour, which is one of the most fundamental problems that we face not only in housing but in the wider social context, affecting the lives of millions of our fellow citizens. The damage is often caused by a tiny minority of people, but its impact is disproportionate on all too many others. Throughout the House there is total determination and agreement that such conduct is completely unacceptable, requiring tough and effective measures to deal with it. To that extent, we agree with the Government entirely.<br><br>
However, I am a little puzzled by the Government's actions. This morning, I was extremely interested to hear on the "Today" programme a Home Office Minister talking about the need to evict drug dealers from council estates. We have no hesitation in saying that people who are convicted of drug-dealing from tenancies on estates run by local authorities or housing associations should be evicted, but we have searched the Housing Bill in vain for such provision, which is why we tabled new clauses 16 and 17 to create new grounds for possession.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that under the Government's strong law and order policies, drug dealers end up in prison and not on council estates?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point that I was making is that unfortunately there has been a proliferation of anti-social behaviour, much of which is connected with drug abuse and drug dealing, and that a Minister from the Home Office talked about the need to evict from their tenancies people convicted of such offences. We believe that that is right, but there is no provision for it in the Bill. Opposition new clauses 16 and 17 would create new grounds for possession.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 334</span>
We are used to the Minister accepting many of our amendments. Although he has not accepted the wording in many cases, when he has been satisfied with an Opposition amendment, he has generally accepted the principle. However, it is the first time that I have heard an Opposition amendment being accepted, several hours before the Committee has debated the subject, by a Minister from another Department talking on the radio. It is a most extraordinary precedent and I hope that it has not set a pattern for the rest of our Committee proceedings, otherwise we shall be in for some strange events.<br><br>
Having made it clear that action against anti-social behaviour is essential, we come to the practical steps that can and should be taken and the ways in which Parliament can assist to ensure that landlord and tenant groups can defend themselves and the community against such behaviour. There are three elements in part V of the Bill. Chapter I refers to introductory tenancies; chapter II deals with new grounds for possession and swifter procedures, to which our amendments to make conviction for a drug-related offence a ground for possession refer; and chapter III refers to other sanctions, especially the scope for injunctions with a power of arrest.<br><br>
We believe that no one single measure is sufficient. Social housing landlords must have the scope to act in the way most likely to deal with any problems that they face in particular circumstances. That is why we favour a broad range of powers and measures to enable effective action to be taken.<br><br>
Some authorities are keen to introduce probationary or introductory tenancies to enable quick possession to be -obtained during the initial period of the tenancy if the tenant misbehaves and makes his or her neighbour's life a misery. Other authorities do not believe that this is the right way forward. They believe that that undermines the principle of security of tenure and say that many perpetrators of anti-social behaviour are either long-established residents or their sons and daughters who would not be caught under introductory tenancies.<br><br>
The Opposition's view is that the power to apply introductory tenancies should be made available to those authorities which want to use such a power, but that there must be proper safeguards in place to ensure that it is not abused. I am afraid that there is obvious scope for abuse. Communities that do not want certain sorts of people to live among them as neighbours could victimise such people because of different but not intrinsically anti-social lifestyles; because of a previous history of, for example, mental illness; or, quite simply, because of the colour of their skin.<br><br>
Communities might try to use the introductory tenancy machinery to get rid of a newcomer who did not fit. That is why there must be proper safeguards. We cannot run away from the fact that such prejudices exist. If introductory tenancies were not accompanied by appropriate safeguards, it could allow neighbours to gang up against an unwelcome new arrival, possibly by lodging spurious complaints and pressurising the landlord to terminate the newcomer's tenancy.<br><br>
I stress that there is no normal safeguard of court discretion to consider the reasonableness of an action for possession in the case of an introductory tenancy. So long as the local authority undertakes the correct procedure, the court must grant a possession order if the local authority
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0193">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 335</span>
landlord seeks it on the grounds that it is an introductory tenancy. In those circumstances—without the normal safeguard of the court's ability to test the reasonableness of the landlord's claim and, therefore, without the ability to test whether it is the product of prejudice or bogus complaints from neighbours—we must ensure that an action taken against someone accused of anti-social behaviour during an introductory tenancy period is applicable only after careful and proper consideration and if there is an opportunity for the decision to be reviewed. Given the risks to which I have referred, it is essential to put in place those safeguards. That is why we have tabled a series of amendments to chapter I of part V of the Bill.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 283, 284 and 291 would require authorities to undertake certain procedures before introducing an introductory tenancy scheme. Amendment No. 283 would require an authority to consult its tenants both on the principle of an introductory tenancy regime and on the arrangements that it will make to bring to an end introductory tenancies and to review any decision to do so. It is important that the authority should discuss with its tenants the reason for introducing such a scheme and how it will operate. It is extremely important that such matters should be considered carefully and thoroughly before the scheme is introduced. When it is introduced, there is scope for abuse if the procedures are not rigorous and if they are not implemented rigorously and scrupulously. So prior consultation is vital.<br><br>
Amendment No. 284 would require the authority to do certain things when it elects to operate an introductory tenancy regime. First, it would require the authority to establish the criteria that must be satisfied before a decision is taken to serve a notice for possession on an introductory tenant. Secondly, it would require the authority to make arrangements for deciding whether the criteria are satisfied. Thirdly, it would require the authority to make arrangements for carrying out a review of any such decision. Bearing in mind the fact that the court does not have discretion to test the reasonableness of the claim, it is essential that there is a review procedure in the local authority before the sanction of the possession proceedings is entered into.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
As presently drafted, the Bill will leave a local authority completely free to decide the circumstances in which it seeks possession against an introductory tenant and the arrangements for considering a request for that decision to be reviewed. We believe that that is too loose; it is open to abuses such as we have described.<br><br>
It is essential that there are proper procedures to be followed. We are not dealing with a matter that is of no significance—taking away someone's home is a most serious sanction. It is right that that sanction should be applied against those people who are guilty of anti-social behaviour, but it would be monstrous if it were applied against people who are simply the innocent victims of a grudge by their neighbours or, even worse, prejudice based on their history or the colour of their skin.<br><br>
That is why we believe that the amendments—or, if the wording is not acceptable to the Minister, amendments based on the same principle—must be incorporated in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 336</span>
Bill to ensure that the sanction of introductory tenancy is available to hit the guilty, but is not abused to evict the innocent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration (Mr. David Curry)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford) has spent some of his weekend revising "Henry IV, Part 1"—which is a great deal better than "Henry IV, Part 2"—I have also thought about what might be appropriate to our debate. I have found a proverb that states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Love your neighbour, yet pull not down your hedge."</p></blockquote>
Robert Frost wrote, even more pithily:
<br><blockquote><p>"Good fences make good neighbours."</p></blockquote>
There is some basic wisdom in that.<br><br>
We all agree that the subject that we are discussing is very serious. All members of the Committee have had surgeries at which people express their concerns about their neighbours in their estates, and we have often heard the local committee—which meets in a back room behind the library, the local community centre or the village hall—saying, "We know who the villains are, and the police know who is causing the problem, but the trouble is that we cannot get a grip on them. If they're taken to court, they're given probation and there is further intimidation, and we can never get anything to stick." That is a familiar problem and there is consensus that we need to find ways in which to deal with it.<br><br>
There is also a consensus that the matter is incremental. No one—be it the Government or the Opposition—expects to produce a global package under the broad heading of community safety orders. None of us imagines that there is an instantaneous, off-the-peg solution. Much depends on how people react, on local authority practices and a shared good will in wanting to make the system work. I shall not claim that what I propose is the definitive solution, and I know that the hon. Member for Greenwich will not make an equivalent claim for Labour's proposals.<br><br>
We have consulted widely with local authorities and other interested bodies to find a way of beginning to deal with existing problems in practical ways. There is a broad consensus, and we are proceeding by trying to identify where practical steps can be taken, in some cases building on experience.<br><br>
There is inevitably a risk—we might as well be honest about it—that people of ill will, will abuse such provisions as we are discussing. We have to guard against that as best we can. We have to trust local authorities—I shall deal with housing associations shortly. Local authorities have wide experience and will know whether or not there is a try-on. We cannot legislate with the precision necessary to make a mathematical distinction between what is an abuse and what is not. That is the spirit in which the measure is proposed.<br><br>
The underlying principle of introductory tenancies is discretionary or permissive. We do not require local authorities to take action. We offer introductory tenancies as technique to be applied if local authorities so wish. Housing associations do not need the measure because assured shorthold tenancies can be used to achieve the same effect. Indeed, I understand that in Great Monsall in Manchester a housing association experiment is taking place with that purpose.<br><br>

We seek to deliver into the hands of local authorities mechanisms that will be effective, but which will still depend a great deal on local authorities wanting to make them work in a sensible way—local authorities will put their own lubrication into the system. For example, no local authority would start evicting someone immediately on receiving a complaint. They would want to know how valid the complaint was, to talk to those concerned and to find a way of making the use of the ultimate power unnecessary.<br><br>
The aims of the amendments are effectively covered in the Bill and in existing powers. As I said, clause 91 provides the key power to local authorities or housing action trusts to elect to set up an introductory tenancy regime. It is a discretionary power. Amendment No. 283 suggests that, if a landlord proposes an introductory regime, he should first consult existing tenants on the details. Local authorities will obviously want to consider the views of existing tenants before making a decision.<br><br>
When we consulted on introductory tenancies, the majority of those tenants' organisations that responded were in favour. Many secure tenants look forward to the scheme with anticipation. Those local authorities that propose such schemes will find it invaluable to know the views of their tenants. How to discover those views—by leaflets, consulting tenants or asking tenants' organisations—is left to the local authorities' discretion. I do not want to be prescriptive in how I ask them to consult, but they do not need a new power to do so because section 105 of the Housing Act 1985 already requires local authorities to consult their tenants on matters of housing management and on changes in practice and policy. A decision to have an introductory tenancy regime would clearly fall within that category. Amendment No. 283 is therefore unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister make it clear that section 105 of the Housing Act 1985 imposes a requirement on local authorities to consult before starting introductory tenancies? Section 105 relates to secure tenancies; it might be a technicality, but because introductory tenancies might not be secure, tenants might not have to be consulted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I discover a wrinkle of that nature—I am sure that it will be drawn to my attention shortly—I shall take the necessary action. My understanding, however, is that section 105 of the Housing Act 1985 requires local authorities to consult their tenants on matters of housing management and, in particular, changes in their practice and policy. A decision to have an introductory tenancy regime would clearly fall within that category. My answer to the hon. Gentleman is therefore in the affirmative. If I were subsequently to discover that that was not accurate, I would wish to make it so.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 284 and 291 are equally unnecessary. They would require an authority to establish criteria for deciding whether to evict tenants and to make arrangements to review decisions to evict. In doing so, authorities must take into account any guidance from the Secretary of State. Local authorities and housing action trusts will need to have rigorous and fair procedures in place and tenants will need to know exactly where they stand, what circumstances could lead to eviction and what they can expect should their landlords start proceedings
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 338</span>
against them. That information will be provided to the tenant in two ways without any need for the amendments. First, local authorities will be playing particular attention to the terms of tenancy agreements that will set out expressly the behaviour that would be regarded as a breach of the agreement.<br><br>
Secondly, clause 102 requires landlords to publish information about the introductory tenancies covering the terms, the rules and their obligations to repair. Each introductory tenant must be supplied with that information and other material on the terms of tenancy that is not already contained in the tenancy agreement. As a result, there will be little or not chance of a tenant not knowing where he stands as an introductory tenant.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Greenwich mentioned the guidance issued by the Secretary of State. We expect local authorities and HATs to pay attention to that guidance. It will cover the issues that the amendments suggest should be considered by a landlord who is thinking of starting an introductory tenancy regime. Given that, I suggest that the amendments are not necessary and I invite the hon. Gentleman not to press them to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I echo what has been said in Committee about the nature of the problem. When I first became a councillor on Sheffield city council in 1976, housing was the most important issue that people wished to discuss. Housing repair matters dominated my surgery casework. Housing is still the issue that most constituents discuss with me at my surgeries as a Member of Parliament. Statistics now show that people raise issues of rehousing and homelessness, on the one hand, and neighbour-nuisance problems, on the other. Indeed, there are now more problems, with neighbours than with repairs in my constituency, which is a sad reflection on life in general.<br><br>
I have always resisted the idea of introductory tenancies, although, in certain circumstances, I could be persuaded. Such a tenancy implies that tenants are guilty until they prove their innocence after 12 months. That leads to the assumption that it is only tenants who cause problems. I mentioned earlier the problems of neighbour nuisance and neighbour harassment. Some of those problems may be caused by new tenants or established tenants, but some people who create nuisance may be owner occupiers, whom we shall discuss in later proceedings.<br><br>
I am worried about the Bill giving the impression that new tenants must prove themselves before they are established to be good tenants. The most rigorous conditions must be applied to such tenancies so that they cannot be open to abuse. I was a little worried that the Minister said that there were always problems when schemes were introduced because they might not operate in the way in which they were intended. I am paraphrasing his argument, but we must be rigorous in defining the grounds on which local authorities can take action, how they take action and the rules under which people against whom action is taken have a right to a review. If such conditions are not defined, the provisions can be subject to abuses. People will be made into scapegoats and will not have the right to argue their case in court to determine whether they have breached their tenancy conditions. People have that right under normal secure tenancy arrangements.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 339</span>
In the end, I shall probably accept introductory tenancies, provided that the criteria are clear and that local authorities consult. I tend, where possible, to err on the side of giving local authorities freedom to act as they consider appropriate in their areas to meet the needs of members of the community. That is the purpose of local government, and we can assist it by giving local authorities more freedom to operate according to local needs. We also have a responsibility to ensure that when we give those powers to local authorities, they will be operated correctly and people who are caught by the powers will not be caught unfairly. The amendments bring those issues to the fore and ensure that, when introductory tenancies are chosen by an authority, they are chosen with tenants' support and applied in such a way that tenants do not suffer unfairly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Diana Maddock <span class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not into quoting Shakespeare, as I said before, but I am rather fond of Robert Frost. I can tell the Minister that, if the dispute is about where the hedge should be, it gets very difficult.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the essential principles of our regeneration policy in the cities is the removal of privet hedges and their replacement with fences, which are much more effective in delineating boundaries and giving people a sense of territory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The problem that I had to deal with involved a tenanted property and an owned property, so the complications can be imagined.<br><br>
We all recognise the need for effective means to deal with unacceptable behaviour. Such behaviour does not merely cause a nuisance; in many cases, it removes almost all quality of life from people in neighbouring properties. We all want efficient and effective means of dealing with the perpetrators. There is likely to be more solid agreement later, when we discuss measures that will enable local authorities to improve on remedies that they already have.<br><br>
Like the hon. Member for Attercliffe, however, I have great reservations about probationary tenancies and I am not the only one with such fears. The Chartered Institute of Housing, Shelter, the citizens advice bureaux and many local authorities are not convinced that introductory tenancies are necessary, or the correct way to proceed. In response to the Minister's consultation, the Chartered Institute of Housing expressed concern about how the scheme would work in practice. Much as I would prefer it not to be introduced at all, the amendments will ensure that it will work properly. We are all so anxious to improve the situation that we may not get it right. As we have seen during the Bill's passage through Parliament, some aspects have not been thought out carefully enough.<br><br>
The Tenants Participation Advisory Service expressed the view that the procedures would not necessarily lead to the speedy eviction that was intended, and that the result could be a series of High Court hearings leading to a prolonged process, just as we had before. That concerns me, and I hope that the Minister will respond.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 340</span>
The citizens advice bureaux have many fears, some of which I share. In many cases, mediation services exist and have been used successfully. We should examine other measures that have proved successful. Existing powers to tackle nuisance will, one hopes, be improved as the Bill progresses.<br><br>
Local authorities do not always make the best use of the powers available to them. The proposals could introduce additional bureaucracy and create further burdens, although that is not the intention.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Greenwich touched on other concerns. People may discriminate against their neighbours because they do not lead the same lifestyle. Unless we get the guidelines right, local authorities could abuse their position. In the old days, some local authorities abused their powers when dealing with tenants. I had hoped that we had left that position behind, and I certainly do not want to return to it.<br><br>
Many people recognise that bad behaviour and nuisance are not confirmed to people entering a new tenancy. Although there are examples in which that is the case, all tenants, not just new tenants, can be guilty of anti-social behaviour.<br><br>
Unless the regulations are framed better than we expect, the Bill will not provide adequate protection against unreasonable eviction. Many people share my concern that racial harassment provisions could be abused. I hope that the Minister will comment on the matter, because there are real fears about probationary tenancies, in particular. When a person moves to an estate, we do not want people to use the powers in a way that creates even more problems for people of other colours. Shelter and citizens advise bureaux share many of my concerns. Local authority tenants are often already discriminated against. I am worried that we will strengthen people's view that a local authority tenant is somehow a lesser person than a person who owns his own home.<br><br>
Other members of the Committee and I attended a dinner earlier in the year at which a senior Minister openly said that he thought that people who owned their own homes made better citizens than those who did not. Given that view, I fear the result of the measures. I hope that the Minister will reassure us about the matter; I remain unconvinced. The rights of many vulnerable people—many of whom will have been homeless—will be undermined by the provisions.<br><br>
In 1980, secure tenancies were introduced to try to eliminate some of the problems that I have described. Some of the abuses that occurred before 1980 may return—the proposals are a retrograde step. Other measures that we shall discuss later will probably be more effective.<br><br>
I recognise that the proposals are not mandatory; I welcome that. I also recognise that authorities that have told me that they are not in favour of the proposals will not want to take them up. However, the freedom given to local authorities under the Bill will leave it open for local authorities and tenants alike to misuse some of the powers. I shall be moving other amendments, but I am happy to support the amendment, which will remove some of the worst fears that the Chartered Institute of Housing, local authorities, citizens advice bureaux, Shelter and I share.<br><br>
I have not been convinced that the introduction of probationary tenancies will make a big difference. Proposals contained in later amendments are likely to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0196">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 341</span>
have much greater effect and are a fairer, better way to proceed. My main fear is that council tenants will once again be stigmatised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always careful when I speak in Committee, because after I speak the debate always seems to continue for twice as long as it would have and everyone attacks me right, left and centre, saying that my views are utterly unacceptable. I believe that my views strike a chord with 99 per cent, of council tenants, who always found that the way in which I ran housing when I was on the Greater London council more acceptable than the sloppy way in which the Labour-controlled councils ran their housing, which led to bad housing and created much friction and unhappiness among the tenants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way for the moment. I know that the hon. Gentleman wants to tell me all about what happened at Shelter and the fact that I disbanded one of his tenants associations, which was spending ratepayers' money simply to attack the Greater London council's policies. All that has gone—the Greater London council is no more. Responsibility for housing has rightly been given to local authorities. I could not see the need for two housing authorities when one would have been acceptable.<br><br>
In those days, I looked at the laws that were available—I do not know why the proposed provisions are in the Bill—and extended the interpretation of the rules. No one took me to task for that; people thought that I was doing the right thing. I came to the conclusion that 99 per cent, of tenants were good, and wanted the peace, quiet and tranquillity that came with being good tenants. What all tenants require—be they tenants of social housing or in the private sector—is simple: a good landlord, who will carefully maintain the property and ensure that tenants have the quiet enjoyment of his property.<br><br>
One always finds bad apples in the barrel, and I used to be firm. I would tell bad tenants that their behaviour was unacceptable, and I would make it clear that they had one bite, but not two—after the second bite, they were given notice to quit. Those tenants then became a matter for other authorities.<br><br>
We have always faced the same problem about housing bad tenants. The Labour party has always tried to make its housing departments all things, but it is important to separate the issues. Housing departments should build houses where they can and manage that housing properly. Other departments should look after the welfare of tenants—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It may be helpful to the Committee if I point out that we are debating specific amendments. It would be helpful if Committee members would resist the temptation to react to other members' speeches, as the debate is becoming too wide. I hope that the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (Mr. Ashby) and others will take note of what I have said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I will, Mrs. Winterton. I know that the amendments have been said to be unnecessary, but I wonder whether some of the Bill's provisions are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 342</span>
necessary, as local authorities already have powers. Local authorities want to be good housing authorities, to ensure that tenants are kept in order.<br><br>
The problem is that—I hope that I am not going too wide—so many housing authorities try to be all things. Much trouble would be avoided if they left other activities to other departments, looked after the welfare of their tenants and saw to it that tenants kept to their agreements and tenancies and did not behave unacceptably towards their neighbours.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
We are discussing probationary tenancies. In my experience, problems arise not because of bad tenants, but because of a bad fit. Often, tenants who are very different from other tenants are put into the same area. The problem that I have encountered most frequently in my constituency when an introductory tenancy has been unsatisfactory has involved tenants who were formerly travellers—not gipsies, but from the Irish tinker fraternity—who did not fit into the area in which they were placed. The introduction of probationary tenancies will be good—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Hanson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I finish what I was saying? I will then give way.<br><br>
I have met many of those people, who are very decent people. They simply have a slightly different lifestyle from those around them. The introduction of probationary tenancies may enable housing authorities, not to get rid of tenants, but relocate them to an area where they may fit in better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We call them ghettos.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The management of a housing authority is an active task. Managers must consider the area and the tenants and see whether they will fit. They must try to create a good mix and take an active role in all aspects of management. There must be continual activity. They cannot sit back and let things happen; that is bad management. Probationary tenancies will allow for active management, despite what has been said and what is, no doubt, about to be said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what the hon. Gentleman said about making tenancies fit. The amendment proposes that probationary tenancies should be the subject of consultation with existing tenants, which is certainly viable. I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman could expand on why, as a chairman of a housing committee or a Member of Parliament, he feels competent to determine who is fit to have a tenancy, and why someone who happens to come from gipsy stock, to be black or to have a psychiatric disorder should be denied the right to a property initially, prior to the probationary tenancy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not ask me those questions. He should ask the housing manager of an area, or, in larger areas, the subsidiary housing managers.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0197">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 343</span>
Let me give the hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) an example of what could happen. As part of care in the community, psychiatric patients may be placed in a given community. That is all very well, but other psychiatric patients may already have been placed in the area; that might create a mismatch and it could be better to place them elsewhere. The examples must be numerous. However, if the hon. Gentleman accepts that management should be active, a good housing management committee would take notice of such problems and try actively to reduce tension and improve the area substantially.<br><br>
I remind the Committee of the example given earlier of a drug dealer. He will have caused an awful lot of misery. If he leaves behind his wife and child—who are quite innocent—the latter will still suffer society's resentment. People will say, "It is absolutely dreadful. The dealers are still going to that house." It would be better to move such a family a bit further away, to relieve the area of the misery caused by the drug dealer, who by then will probably be in prison.<br><br>
I can think of many examples, but there is no point in focusing on one. We must consider the merits of specific cases. Probationary tenancies will certainly provide the flexibility that a good housing management committee would want.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister started with a comment about fences. Of course, in farming areas, the idea of a good fence is that, if your flocks tray on to the neighbour's land they eat his grass not yours. I can understand why Ministers are keen not to let people stray. It might help if a few Conservative Members strayed over here to support our amendments.<br><br>
There seems to be basic agreement about dealing with those tenants who cause mayhem for their neighbours, but it is an extremely difficult problem and getting the legislation right is not a party-political issue. It is a question of whether we, as politicians, have a knee-jerk reaction to the problem and propose solutions that do not work, or whether we can make life better for out constituents. We must be careful.<br><br>
The idea of an introductory tenancy has superficial appeal. However, my experience as a Member of Parliament is that the majority of problems between neighbours do not start when the new neighbour moves in, but develop over time, as children grow older and perhaps more unruly and as couples split up and new partners move in. The Government's proposals will not get to grips with the worst of the neighbourhood problems. It is important that such a proposal is introduced evenly over a local authority or housing action trust area. I shall give a small illustration.<br><br>
Three or four years ago, the mostly council property with three or four bedrooms in a road in my constituency were almost all occupied by elderly people; some of them had lived there since the houses were built. The gardens were immaculate; the grass was almost polished every morning; the flowers were all dead-headed. Eventually, one of the tenants died and a new family moved in—a family with small children. At first sight, the children could be called sticky. They certainly did not feel the need to be tidy and they had a somewhat limited view of right and wrong. For instance, they saw nothing wrong in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 344</span>
nipping into the garden next door to get the ball back—or possibly to take a flower. There was uproar among the existing tenants, who thought that their new neighbours were spoiling the peace and tranquillity of their neighbourhood. It took much effort to persuade those people to show a small amount of tolerance towards their new neighbour and to convince them that it was not a case for demanding eviction or for getting together a posse to get the new neighbour out. Such cases occur quite frequently.<br><br>
The danger is that, as councils apply different standards to different parts of their property, introductory tenancies might be enforced with greater vigour and high standards might be demanded on one street, but they might not be enforced to anything like the same standard in other areas of the town. It is important for the Government to make it clear that local authorities, or anyone else who implements such schemes, must adopt an even approach.<br><br>
The same standards must apply across the authority. If not, ghetto estates might be created in which the authority allows people to behave in ways which it does not accept in other parts of the town. That is unacceptable, because it devalues housing stock and causes major problems. Most of us are aware that such ghetto estates have, for one reason or another, developed across the country.<br><br>
It is important that we do not allow the clause to make that problem any worse. Therefore, there must be consultation with tenants and a scheme must be created in which basically the same criteria apply to all an authority's stock. I accept that there might be a few differences. Stockport council has a policy under which it gives tenancies on one estate only to people over the age of 40. Slightly different standards can be applied if, as a policy decision, only people of a certain age are allowed to take on tenancies in a certain estate. Equally, if there are problems with deck-access flats, or flats where noise echoes, slightly different standards can be applied.<br><br>
However, standards should be openly discussed with tenants, who should agree to them, and they should be applied evenly across the authority. Amendment No. 284 would move in that direction. If all that is not done, either ghettos will develop or local authorities will evict people who have not behaved especially unreasonably and start to shuffle them around.<br><br>
Sheffield might be tempted to find out whether certain tenants have associations with Macclesfield or Congleton and, if so, send them along the railway line. Equally, Macclesfield and Congleton might think that some of their more difficult tenants would be better off in Stockport or Manchester. We all know that people are pushed from one place to another within or between local authorities, and we must not make their problems worse. If the Minister cannot accept the amendment, he should assure us that he expects local authorities to behave in the way in which I have suggested.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hampstead and Highgate)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I strongly endorse what my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) has just said. I, too, share the concerns that have been expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe and by the hon. Member for Chiistchurch (Mrs. Maddock) on the possibility that tenants who accept introductory tenancies
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0198">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 345</span>
might have to prove that they are innocent after a year of enduring the possibility that their neighbours regard them as being guilty.<br><br>
When the Minister responded to my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich, he said that it would be the responsibility of local authorities to make it clear to introductory tenants precisely what the terms of their tenancy agreement were. Although I agree with him in principle on that, he is ignoring the reality of the situation for many people who might be offered such tenancies, most of whom are desperate for some form of secure, acceptable housing. In many cases, those people who cause trouble are deemed to be bad neighbours not because they are bad, or indeed, mad, but because the pressure of their lives is such that they find it extremely difficult to cope. It would be appalling if we allowed ourselves to be influenced by particularly active neighbours.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) referred to a road in which tenants had lived since the houses were built and how the death of one of them resulted in a new family with young children moving in. I can replicate that in my constituency. Under the right-to-buy scheme, some of the houses are owner-occupied and there is an even greater sense of such streets being exclusively theirs and that the people living in them must accord to their view of what constitutes a lifestyle. I am not talking about people who play very loud music at all hours, bang doors or who are wilfully destructive of their environment; I refer to the differences of what constitutes a life of quiet enjoyment of one's property. The Government must be careful not to open the door to particularly active tenants who view their area as exclusively their own preserve and who may bring unnecessary and unfair pressure on the local authority.<br><br>
I am sorry that the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire is not here because I want to refer briefly to his contribution. He is rapidly becoming the Rip van Winkle of housing. He seems to have awakened from a thousand years of sleep and does not know what has been happening in housing. In the past decade, the idea of right-to-buy, management co-operatives, local authorities having certain properties managed by someone other than themselves, and so on seems to have totally escaped his notice. To refer again to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish, the problems that we are attempting to deal with can be solved only if we drop party-political knee-jerk reactions.<br><br>
In my constituency the issue of drug dealing is monstrous. It is not unusual in an estate that has a sand box for parents to refuse absolutely to allow their children to go anywhere near it in the summer because it is full of used hypodermic needles. It is not unusual for neighbours to be plagued by drug users, arriving at all hours of the day and night. One of my constituents on an estate opened her front door and found a man literally dying of a drug overdose on her doorstep. Those are serious and difficult problems. When my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich was making his opening remarks, the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire intervened and said that drug dealers cannot be found on local estates because they are in prison. He put that down to his Government's law and order policies, but I am afraid that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 346</span>
their policies had the effect of removing 22 police officers from my constituency. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Bolton, West (Mr. Sackville) who spoke on the radio this morning referred to drug dealers who, having collected money from estates, return to the leafy suburbs where they live. Clearly, he does not attach a great deal of importance to his Government's law and order policies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Lady is straying a little far. Will she please return to the straight and narrow?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You were most generous, Mrs. Winterton, in allowing me to go down that primrose path for as long as you did.<br><br>
We all know from our surgeries of the real stress that can be caused by people who are less than good neighbours, but that does not relieve us of our obligation to be equally aware that pressure will undoubtedly be brought to bear on local authorities for what neighbours perceive to be a difference in lifestyle. I cite an example from my constituency of a family that was the victim of what can only be regarded as an organised campaign by neighbours. According to the neighbours, the family was being disruptive because of the sort of food that the family eats, which is highly spiced, using a lot of herbs. Personally, I find the smells emanating from that kitchen especially attractive. When such considerations are presented to a local authority in an organised campaign, as they were in that instance, we need safeguards such as those that we propose, which are much tighter than those that the Minister suggested were included in the Bill in his response to my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, may I associate myself with the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Attercliffe? I wish that introductory tenancies were not the subject before us, but given that they are, Opposition members of the Committee have acted responsibly by saying that, despite our reservations about the principle, we shall try to make them work appropriately.<br><br>
The amendments would require two simple things: first, consultation with existing tenants of an estate or a group of houses about the establishment of a scheme and, secondly, that clear criteria are set, so that schemes can be understood and accepted and are seen to be fair, open, proper and accountable by those concerned. Consultation and openness are two important principles that should extend beyond even this Committee, but which are certainly important in relation to anti-social behaviour on council estates.<br><br>
A small number of tenants in estates in all constituencies will from time to time cause problems. Those problems may relate to noise, serious drugs offences, smells, fence and hedge disputes and so on, but a small number of tenants on any estate will always cause problems. That happened on the council estate on which I grew up; it happens on the council estates in which my constituents live. The best way to tackle such problems is to consult tenants and tenants' associations that represent those who live on the estate, before problems arise.<br><br>
If local authorities are to decide serious matters of public policy, it is incumbent upon them to consult tenants fully so that they have an imput into that policy. Some

problems on estates are not simply problems with tenants but problems associated with the effects of poverty, design and allocation, for example, the lack of soundproofing and double glazing or walkways with difficult access. Tenants may be able not merely to deal with problems of noisy tenants or drug-related poor tenancies, but to put them into the context of the poor performance of the housing management authority, the allocation policy, the poor social circumstances of the estate and of society as a whole.<br><br>
On some of the worst estates in my constituency, male unemployment is 50, 60 or 70 per cent. Such levels of unemployment and lack of activity cause some anti-social behaviour. Some problems on estates are due to the design of the properties. Consultation with tenants, which is provided for by amendment No. 283, is important, because tenants have to live with the problem of poor tenancies, but also with the aftermath of any evictions. They have to live with the consequences for an estates's environment that arise prior to action being taken. Consultation is important because the tenants left on the estate have a stake in it, both before and after action is taken by the local authority.<br><br>
Amendment No. 284 concerns criteria. It is important that there is a statutory power to force local authorities to establish clear criteria. Anti-social behaviour is not restricted to council estates, and we can visit any number of estates, private or council, in our constituencies and see happening what we have discussed today. Some problems would be genuine and local authorities should deal with them, but others would be neighbour disputes that have got out of hand. Clear criteria must be laid down.<br><br>
We must take into account those individuals who have a history of psychiatric disorders, a point made to me by Shelter Cymru. They live in properties under the care in the community programme. Their neighbours might not understand their problems and may make complaints about them under the introductory tenancy scheme. Unless there are clear guidelines on the remits of complaints and what matters local authorities must investigate, individuals with psychiatric problems or those who do not get on with their neighbours could face victimisation. Furthermore, some individuals might have certain peculiarities such as those mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson) when she referred to cooking regimes.<br><br>
Tenants must be involved in drawing up guidelines which should be established clearly and made open and accountable. Such arrangements must be policed by the local authority to ensure that they mean something. We want to ensure that the anti-social behaviour of drug dealers and others is tackled; it must be done in a way in which involves tenants, so that it is open and accountable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) put an overwhelming argument for why we must consider the issue seriously. The tests that should be applied are reasonableness and effectiveness. There is no difference between us in our overall objective to deal with neighbour nuisance and harassment. Sometimes in the serenity of this place, we lose sight of the real world. I have nine council estates in my constituency, many of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 348</span>
which the Minister knows at first hand, in which 90 per cent, of the tenants are on benefit. Unemployment is at a staggering level.<br><br>
People want the situation in estates to improve and want to help themselves. That is happening. Projects have been set up on many estates. The Bierley estate in my constituency will be featured on tonight's "Network First" programme as an estate in which the crime rate is significant. I do not think it is a good example of problem estates. Due to regeneration, it is moving in the right direction.<br><br>
The different way in which estates are policed has been mentioned. When we refer to neighbour nuisance we are talking not about minor irritations, but people who live in fear of violence and who have an unacceptable quality of life. They want something done about it. The Minister accepted that the measure is the first step along a hard line. I welcome it, but there must be equilibrium in its application. I hope that he will reflect on what has been said. We want the estates to be improved. The nine estates in my constituency are mainly white and are in an area that has a 20 per cent, ethnic minority population. There must be closer integration to meet housing needs and the amendment is a step in the right direction. The Minister must, as I know he will, consider our concerns. The amendments will provide the opportunity to develop an effective policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been wide ranging, and I shall sum up the specific points that have been raised. The hon. Member for Attercliffe asked whether his concern was covered by what I said. I consulted the oracle and I am told that it is. I assure him that the requirement for consultation is covered by the existing language. As I said, it is important to remember what we are trying to achieve. We are talking about giving to local authorities the option—it is not compulsory—to introduce the system of introductory tenancy for all those who accede to a tenancy. It will apply not just to some people—to people who are black or yellow or brown or white, or those who like curry or who eat fish and chips every night—but to everyone who enters a tenancy. When those people have met the conditions of the probation for 12 months, that tenancy automatically becomes—on day 366, or 367 in a leap year—secure.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
We are not talking about people having to prove their behaviour. They will not have to sit wondering, as they approach Christmas or the end of the 12 months, whether they will receive a piece of paper saying that they have passed the test. None of that will happen. The clause is designed to provide an instrument to local authorities, if they wish, to help those people on the estates who, as we all agree, are trying to create a liveable life.<br><br>
I shall not rehearse the problems that we have all identified in estates, as they are familiar to everyone who has even the most passing acquaintance with them. The hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate mentioned drugs, but drugs are a problem on estates that are much smaller and more rural than those to which she referred in her constituency.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe), whose constituency I know well, brought a delegation from the Holmwood tenants action group to discuss with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0200">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 349</span>
me how they could get a grip on cleaning up their estate. My recollection is that they would have welcomed more draconian measures than either the hon. Member for Greenwich suggests or I suggest. The delegation's suggestions may have been more preemptory, as people who live next to the problem day after day may have fewer charitable instincts than those of us have who dip into the matter, as we necessarily must as Members of Parliament.<br><br>
I recognise the concerns of the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock) about abuse, but one cannot not take action just because the action that one takes might be open to abuse—that option does not exist. We must trust local authorities, who are experienced in the field, to react in accordance with the guidelines, which seek to provide protection. Local authorities do not set targets for how many people they can evict to clean up estates. They want to act responsibly, and will take whatever measures necessary to stop short of using the more severe powers to create a better climate on estates.<br><br>
As I said to my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire, the provisions do not replace existing powers, but will provide an optional, additional instrument in the early stages, which may be able to weed out the inherent problems of estates, so that local authorities do not have to use the more draconian and prolonged procedures that are necessary to deal with other tenants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given us assurances on other aspects of the Bill about which we have been worried, and has said that he will keep an eye on what happens. Will he also keep a close eye on how local authorities use probationary tenancies?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course I will do that. As I said, the power is discretionary. The local authorities that have expressed an interest are as diverse as Manchester and Wandsworth. We shall see local authorities developing those schemes, and we shall want to see how the schemes evolve. We will of course monitor them, and the Secretary of State's guidance will apply.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish—like him, we do not want ghetto estates to develop. We now know much about how to use allocations to create a sense of community on an estate—for example, we know that there is a threshold of families with young kids or of people of retirement age. We are learning more all the time about how we can use allocations creatively to build communities on estates. We are gaining experience of that. There should be fair play and a level playing field, as has been said. It is the policy that introductory tenancies should apply equally to all tenants. A local authority should enforce the terms of the regime in the same way throughout its estates, and it should deal even-handedly with the problem of anti-social behaviour among existing tenants—secure tenants. Introductory tenancies will not make the problem worse.<br><br>
In answer to the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate, I emphasise that it is not intended that tenants should have to prove their innocence. The introductory tenancy becomes a secure tenancy as the 12-month period elapses.<br><br>
Let me repeat to the hon. Member for Delyn that my objection to the amendments arises not from what they are trying to achieve, but from the fact that that is already
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 350</span>
in the Bill. I do not think that anything has more force because it is said twice. There is an argument against cluttering the Bill with measures that are already accommodated.<br><br>
We all subscribe to the aims that the hon. Member for Greenwich is trying to achieve. We have covered those matters and the amendments are unnecessary. I invite him to withdraw them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cirencester and Tewkesbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has given the power to local housing authorities and housing action trusts. Is the power to be given to housing associations and, if not, why not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Housing associations can already use assured shorthold tenancies, which achieve the same effect. A housing association in the Manchester area is conducting a trial using the mechanism.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to my hon. Friend for not being present when he gave that reply earlier. If that is the case, the housing association will have to operate the scheme for all its houses, although it may have entirely different schemes in different parts of the country. It may be inappropriate for the housing association to operate the powers on all its schemes. Will my hon. Friend give thought to that and consider whether it would be appropriate for housing associations to operate different regimes in different parts of the country?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly give thought to what my hon. Friend says, but I do not wish to give any response off the cuff, without reviewing the scheme that is currently being undertaken.<br><br>
We have had a long and fruitful debate, which has set the parameters of the important discussions that we shall have in the next few days. I invite the hon. Member for Greenwich not to persist with the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has invited us to accept his assurances and withdraw the amendment. I will go halfway, and hope that he, in turn, will go halfway, as I think that there is a basis for agreement.<br><br>
We have had an interesting debate and heard extremely telling and well-informed speeches from my hon. Friends and from the hon. Member for Christchurch, highlighting the potential problems and the risk of abuse and emphasising the importance of safeguards. In his response the Minister offered a number of interesting angles, none of which fully addressed the problem. He started with a literary association. Quoting from Robert Frost, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Good fences make good neighbours."</p></blockquote>
In the criminal fraternity, that quotation could easily be misinterpreted. I am not sure such a fence would make a good neighbour.<br><br>
The Minister's defence against our amendments is equally suspect. The first line that he took was that there is an inevitable risk—the innocent may get caught. That is the same line that he took last week, when we discussed the potential risks for people under special control provisions in relation to HMOs. We accept that with probationary tenancies there may be a risk. We have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0201">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 351</span>
tabled amendments to try to minimise the risk and to put safeguards in place to ensure that, wherever possible, those risks do not result in the innocent being penalised.<br><br>
Secondly, the Minister claimed that no authority would act unreasonably or precipitately, but he did not respond to the many persuasive examples cited by my hon. Friends, particularly those given by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish, of pressure being put on a family or person by neighbours who, for whatever reason, did not want them living in their community. In response to heavy pressure from neighbours, an authority might feel obliged to act; it might do so in good faith, believing that the evidence amassed by those neighbours was correct.<br><br>
In such a situation, an injustice could be done to someone who was not an anti-social tenant, who was not intimidating the neighbourhood, but whose face did not fit—possibly because of a history of mental illness, possibly because of a life style that was not entirely compatible with the neighbours, or possibly—this is the worst of possibilities—because he had a black face or a face of a different colour from the other tenants. It is an horrendous risk to allow the possibility of institutionalised discrimination, carried out under pressure from one section of the community against someone who did not fit into that community. It is too serious a risk for use to skate over it and to say that it may happen, but that we must proceed in the interests of the greater good.<br><br>
The Minister offered other defences. First, he said that the scheme is optional. Fine. He said that will not apply if local authorities do not think it necessary; but it will apply if local authorities want to use it—and the risk of abuse, the risk of a mistake or an injustice will still apply. Then he said that the scheme would last for only one year. That reminds me of the defence traditionally given by the single parent—it was only a small baby. During that one year, injustices can still occur. We must safeguard people against such injustices.<br><br>
Another ministerial line was that we cannot put off action for fear of abuse. I agree that we should not put off action, which is why, despite reservations, many Opposition Members support the principle of introductory tenancies. We know that action must be taken, and that authorities must have a broad range of powers. But, for exactly that reason, we say that there must be safeguards to ensure that those powers are used properly and to avoid the risk of abuse.<br><br>
Lastly, the Minister argued that introductory tenancies would not be discriminatory because they would apply equally to all tenants and that everyone would be subject to them. Frankly, the Minister does not understand the problem. It will not be the 99 white tenants behaving normally who are the subject of discrimination; but it could be the black or the Asian family, the person with a history of mental illness, or the person whose children run a little wild. That would be an injustice. It would be wrong. It would involve discriminatory treatment against a particular group.<br><br>
The Minister assured us that there was no need for amendment No. 283, because the existing consultation requirements on local authorities would be sufficient. My hon. Friend the Member for Attercliffe said that, on technical grounds, it might be difficult to require
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 352</span>
authorities to consult on introductory tenancies when the normal definition relates to secure tenancies. The Minister gave us an assurance: I am happy to accept it. I shall seek leave to withdraw amendment No. 283, but that is the extent to which we go with the Minister.<br><br>
However, we do not feel the same about amendment No. 284. That amendment requires procedures to be in place to ensure that the risk of abuse is minimised. I remind the Committee that the amendment would require authorities to
<br><blockquote><p>"establish criteria which must be satisfied before any decision is taken"</p></blockquote>
to serve notice of possession proceedings. Secondly, it would require authorities to
<br><blockquote><p>"make arrangements for deciding whether, in any individual case, those criteria are satisfied".</p></blockquote>
Thirdly, it would require authorities to
<br><blockquote><p>"make arrangements for carrying out any review of such a decision".</p></blockquote>
Those are simple, basic requirements. The authority should be clear about the grounds for seeking possession in the case of introductory tenancies, how to judge whether a tenant had offended against one of those criteria and would therefore be subject to possession proceedings, and what would be the procedure. Those are important criteria, which ought to apply in every authority.<br><br>
The Minister cited clause 102 in his defence, saying that authorities would be required to provide information. Clause 102 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Every local housing authority or housing action trust which lets dwelling-houses under introductory tenancies shall from time to time publish information about its introductory tenancies, in such form as it considers best suited to explain in simple terms, and, so far as it considers it appropriate, the effect of—
<ol>
<li>the express terms of its introductory tenancies,</li>
<li>the provisions of this Chapter, and</li>
<li>the provisions of sections 11 to 16 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (landlord's repairing obligations)."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
That is very broad indeed. The local authority must simply inform its tenants of the law and its express terms. It does not require the local authority to define criteria or to have procedures, or to prescribe which officer should review the decision or whether a committee or simply officers should be involved in the review. All those matters are important. Everyone who knows the process of local government knows how important it is to get the procedures right.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
We cannot understand why the Minister is reluctant to accept the amendment. It would not impose an onerous obligation; nor would it put obstacles in the way of authorities that want to take effective action against anti-social behaviour. It would not result in the guilty getting off scot-free—heaven knows, enough guilty people got off scot free recently. It would provide one additional safeguard for the innocent against the risk of a miscarriage of justice. For an issue of this importance, I do not understand the Minister's reluctance to accept our amendment.<br><br>
The Minister acknowledged that our amendment would oblige local authorities to consider guidance. We did not mention that the guidance should be issued both by the local authority associations and by the Secretary of State. Of course we accept the need for guidance from the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0202">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 353</span>
Secretary of State, but there should be guidance from the local authority associations, too. They are working on it at present, which is another factor that should be considered.<br><br>
Amendment No. 284 is fundamental to ensuring a really fair system that will provide proper safeguards against the risk of a miscarriage of justice. It will make a grave mistake if we do not put that important safeguard in place when agreeing a framework for introductory tenancies that could leave many tenants at risk of losing their homes simply because of the prejudice of their neighbours in some cases. It is too high a risk to allow that to be left without cover. We shall press amendment No. 284 to a vote, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw amendment No. 283.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 318, in page 53, line 33, leave out second 'or'.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>'or,</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(c) in the case where the authority has adopted the tenancy, the tenant was a regulated tenant, an assured tenant (other than of an assured shorthold tenancy), or had resided in the dwelling-house for more than 12 months.'</p></blockquote></span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 354</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 91 provides that local authorities can establish introductory tenancies for the first year of what would otherwise—and will eventually—be secure tenancies. However, subsection (2) includes two exceptions under which people who take up theoretically new tenancies with councils which opt to set up introductory tenancies can immediately become secure tenants. In both cases, the exception is for those who previously had secure tenures.<br><br>
The principle behind the amendment is exactly the same. People should not be treated less favourably than they were previously. Why should the sitting tenants of a dwelling that is compulsorily purchased lose their security of tenure? Why should those who have lived in a dwelling for 20 years, whose landlord has not chosen to evict them, lose the security of tenure that they would otherwise have? I am especially anxious because, although only a few tenants will be affected, they might be vulnerable elderly people who have lived in a property for a long time.<br><br>
Amendment No. 318 is a technical amendment designed to allow additional exceptions, paving the way for amendment No. 319, which makes it clear that, where a housing authority has adopted a property in which the tenants either have existing security of tenure or have lived in the house for longer than the probationary period, they should not be subject to the rules of introductory tenancies because, in effect, they have already served their probation. That would apply to only a few households of, perhaps, vulnerable or elderly people. The principle behind the amendment is important. The amendment is in line with other exemptions in the Bill, and I hope that the Minister will accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the principles behind the introductory tenancy regime is that, where a local authority or a housing action trust has such a regime in force, all new tenants should be subject to the trial period of 12 months. We do not want a landlord to be able to pick and choose which tenants should go on probation, as it were. That would open up opportunities for discrimination.<br><br>
However, some established tenants of either a local authority or a housing association will have a good track record from their previous tenancy, and there is no reason to ask such people to go back to scratch. That is the purpose of the clause.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Christchurch would make further exceptions by including regulated tenants, assured tenants—not just those of registered social landlords—and those who have resided in households for more than 12 months. I do not agree with that.<br><br>
Introductory tenancies are designed to deal with the problems that local authorities and housing action trusts encounter in their role as social landlords. Therefore, it is entirely right that people who come from another social tenancy background should have the benefit of that continuity. However, where people come from different sorts of tenancy there can be no objection to them being asked to undergo the 12-month period of probationary or introductory tenancies.<br><br>
Local authorities and housing associations liaise on matters such as allocation of tenancies and they can check the records of individual tenants, so they have some security. Private landlords are not necessarily in the same
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0203">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 355</span>
position, as we heard in the debate on HMOs. They might be absentee landlords. They do not always have the same supervisory role, and they do not have as wide a remit—as local authorities do—to act in the interests of the area and their council tax payers. Therefore, we should not extend the exemptions. There must be a clear distinction between people who come from parallel social tenancies and, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely disappointed with the Minister's reply. As we are anxious to make progress as he is so vehemently against the amendment, there is little to be gained by pressing it to a Division. Having dealt with homes that have been taken over by the local authorities where road schemes have not gone ahead, I think that the matter could worry a number of elderly people. I beg to ask leave to withdraw that amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now come to a further set of amendments intended to provide specific and important safeguards in respect of people who are either vulnerable under the definitions of clause 148—which deals with homelessness—or have been housed under community care provisions or planned resettlement programmes.<br><br>
In previous debates, there was general agreement—with the possible exception of the hon. Member for North-West Lecicestershire—that it is vital for social housing landlords to ensure that appropriate arrangements are made to support people who are vulnerable or who are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 356</span>
rehoused under community care and similar programmes. We all know that without such support, people who are suffering from psychiatric problems or who are prone to alcohol or drug abuse can become a danger to themselves and a nuisance to their neighbours.<br><br>
The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that an appropriate range of support is provided for people in such circumstances before they are evicted under the probationary tenancy procedures—or afterwards, because the problem does not end if they are simply turfed out of their homes.<br><br>
I ask your leave, Mrs. Winterton, to take the amendments out of sequence, because it will be more logical to explain amendment No. 288 first. Amendment No. 288 would oblige a landlord, when a tenant has been rehoused under a community care or resettlement programme, or when a tenant is in one of the vulnerable categories as defined in the obligations to the homeless, to notify the appropriate social services agency that he is seeking possession. That is common sense. If someone who has been housed is vulnerable, he is almost certainly in contact with social services and receiving support, and the person providing support or care ought to know if possession proceedings are being taken against that person.<br><br>
There can be no logical objection to the amendment, and I hope that the Minister will not even try to object to it.<br><br>
When an introductory tenancy has been terminated—where the behaviour of the person has led to the authority using the possession proceedings, going to court, and terminating the tenancy—amendment No. 285 would oblige the housing authority to co-operate with social services, or a relevant voluntary organisation involved in providing care for the individual, to assess the former tenant's needs for care, support and suitable alternative accommodation, and to ensure that arrangements for providing those are in place.<br><br>
Once again, that is pure common sense. The person may have caused trouble and the tenancy may have been terminated, but the authority cannot wash its hands of the problem. They cannot simply say, "That's it. The tenancy is terminated. We shall no longer pay any heed to that person's need." By definition, we are talking about people who are vulnerable or who have been housed under care in the community provisions, or rehoused under resettlement arrangements—vulnerable people who need care and support.<br><br>
In such cases, it is obviously sensible that arrangements are made to try to ensure that a person who has been evicted from a probationary or introductory tenancy should be helped to find somewhere else to live and should then receive an appropriate level of care and support—which will hopefully ensure that the process does not happen again. The worst possible thing would be if, following the termination of one tenancy, the person found themselves in another tenancy from another social landlord where the whole problem recurred because of a lack of appropriate care and support.<br><br>
It is pure common sense to ensure that, where an introductory tenancy is terminated in such cases, there is proper co-operation between the housing authority and other relevant care agencies to make appropriate provision for the future.<br><br>

Amendment No. 315 covers circumstances in which a power of arrest has been exercised under the injunctive procedures that we shall discuss when we come to chapter III of part V. The amendment would require the judge to oblige the local authority to make a community care assessment of someone who has been remanded under the power of arrest as part of the injunctive procedures. That is sensible; if people have been arrested and remanded because of their behaviour, and they are vulnerable or have been rehoused as part of a community care programme, it is essential that an assessment be made of what needs to be done. Such people cannot be left in prison.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
The amendments are all practical and sensible. They are designed to ensure the better operation of the community care policy and that people whose anti-social behaviour is probably the product of mental illness, psychiatric disorder or other personality problem should not be dumped on the streets. It is the necessary corollary of introductory tenancies that we make appropriate provision for vulnerable people who may be put out of their homes. I hope that the obvious merits of the amendments will commend themselves to the Minister and that we shall receive a more positive response than we did on our previous sets of amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We must not fall into the trap of believing that in proposing introductory tenancies we are discovering a range of new problems that local authorities have not had to deal with for years. We are trying to provide a new instrument to deal with some very old problems.<br><br>
Local authorities have dealt with vulnerable tenants, because they already exist. In the guidance, we shall remind local authorities of the special issues, and we are co-operating closely with the Department of Health, especially because of our shared concerns about people who are mentally ill. However, we question whether that matter needs to be included in the Bill.<br><br>
If a local authority were to use the power to try to get rid of an inconvenient person, who might have mental illness or belong to one of the categories covered by the amendments, it would find that that person would fall straight back into its care, under its responsibilities for homelessness or community care. The local authority does not have the option of getting shot of the problem, as the problem simply re-emerges.<br><br>
I believe that that is better dealt with by guidance. I give the hon. Gentleman the undertaking that I shall examine his suggestion. If I feel that the guidance will not provide the assurances of support that he believes necessary, I shall table amendments at a later stage to cover that, but I want to investigate the possibility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's last comments. It is clear from our discussions that many of us are concerned about vulnerable groups whom we do not want to suffer in any way because of the Bill. We are talking about those people who may not be able to deal with arrangements for themselves, particularly those who have mental health problems.<br><br>
The Minister always sounds terribly reasonable, saying that he understands what we are talking about and that he will deal with problems somewhere else in the Bill, but
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 358</span>
some of us are still worried that he is trying to put one over on us—I think that that is the phrase. I welcome the fact that he will reconsider the matter, and I hope that we shall receive assurances that he has not been giving the Committee sweet words.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I agree with the hon. Member for Christchurch that the Minister is trying to put one over on us. I think that someone else is putting one over on him. The Minister has been reprimanded for accepting too many Opposition amendments, and he is now having to show that he is tough. That is why we have not made any progress today. I thought that I was going to have to say that my only hope of having Opposition amendments accepted would be through the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Bolton, West (Mr. Sackville) on the "Today" programme.<br><br>
The Minister has agreed to consider the possibility that the procedures will not give adequate cover for vulnerable tenants and those being rehoused under care in the community programmes. I accept that undertaking. He will find, however, that there are potential gaps in the procedures. He said that local authorities were already dealing with the problem but, by definition, the amendments would cover circumstances in which local authorities have failed to do so. We are discussing people being evicted and something must be done about it. There will be an on-going need, not just for housing, but for care. I hope that the Minister's investigation will reveal the need for a more precise arrangement than exists in the Bill and that he will return with amendments to deal with the problem. On the basis of his undertaking, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

DURATION OF INTRODUCTORY TENANCY</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 254, in page 54, line 40, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'() This section has effect subject to section (<i>Effect of beginning proceedings for possession</i>) (effect of beginning proceedings for possession).'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government new clause 8—<i>Effect of beginning proceedings for possession.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A landlord cannot end a tenancy other than by obtaining a court order for possession under clause 94. The problem is that the landlord may seek possession from the court before the trial period expires, but the order might not be made until some time after the 12-month
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0205">Image</span>

period of the introductory tenancy expired. If that happens, the tenant would automatically become secure and the landlord would be able to gain possession only via the more onerous route of proving grounds to the court.<br><br>
The same problem could arise if the introductory tenancy came to an end for another reason, for example, if a body other than a local authority or housing action trust became the landlord. Amendment No. 254 and new clause 8 will remedy that position. When a landlord has begun possession proceedings before the trial period comes to an end, the tenancy will not stop being an introductory tenancy until the date on which the court orders the tenant to give up possession. When, for example, a different landlord takes over the tenancy, he will be able to continue with the proceedings as though the tenancy were still introductory. The measures are sensible and will ensure that the mechanics of the regime work smoothly. I commend them to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall not oppose the amendment, but we cannot fail to point out the differences in the Government's responses. When identifying a loophole under which a probationary tenancy might not be terminated because of a delay in the process between the serving of the notice and the court considering the order, the Government return with a large and detailed new clause to rectify the matter. When we earlier identified loopholes that would deal with vulnerable people at risk of losing their homes or those who might be subject to discrimination and abuse, the Government did not accept our amendment. Such a difference in their approach is very revealing and the Committee should be aware of it.<br><br>
We want to see introductory tenancies work in a way that ensures that the guilty are punished and the innocent are not victimised unduly. We accept entirely that, for technical reasons, people should not get away simply because the introductory tenancy was not terminated within the 12-month period. However, we wish that the Government would be more positive about amendments that would cover other loopholes and abuses.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain the effect of clauses 94, 95 and 96 on the courts. I understand that the courts will be used only to check that the procedure has been carried out correctly. They will not be used to make a judgment whether the request to terminate the tenancy is reasonable. I hope that I have understood that correctly.<br><br>
The local authority has to decide to terminate the tenancy, so it will have to serve notice and carry out all the other statutory duties that will be expected. It will then have to put in place an appeals procedure. Again, that involves a whole set of statutory procedures. In essence, the local authority will make the decision to terminate and the appeal will be made to it. All that the courts have to do is to check that everything has been done correctly, and if so, make the order.<br><br>
I do not believe—and neither will the tenant—that that is natural justice. It may be that the authority will set up an initial panel to make a decision to terminate the tenancy and then set up a totally different procedure for the appeal. I believe that the court should choose whether to implement the recommendations of the local authority, rather than merely check the procedure. I may have misunderstood, but I should have thought that if the courts have no discretion, they will be rather narked at being used in that way. There should be a way of allowing the courts to make the choice, rather than the local authority or some other person being entitled to terminate the tenancy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Brooke <span class='memberconstituency'>(City of London and Westminster, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot tell whether amendments Nos. 286 and 287, which the hon. Gentleman has just moved, are coupled or alternates. It seems curious that they should be alternates because amendment No. 286 would be unnecessary if amendment No. 287 were accepted. If amendment No. 286 is free standing, I am reminded of the definition of an act of God in Blackstone's law dictionary—it is an act that no reasonable man would expect God to commit. I always feel a certain dismay when having simply to rely on the judgment of a reasonable man. That appears to be the case in amendment No. 286—I do not speak as a lawyer, but it seems to be relying on the judgment of the man on the Clapham omnibus.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the right hon. Gentleman for that intervention. No doubt the Minister can do an even better job of demolishing the wording of the amendment. I was trying to identify what I perceive to be a problem. If the Minister accepts that there is a problem, I am sure that other people can find the words to solve it. I want the Minister to clarify whether my interpretation of how the clauses will work is correct.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentelman's understanding is correct. The procedures set out in the Bill are deliberate as we want to provide ways in which local authority social landlords can deal rapidly with problems that emerge at

the beginning of a tenancy. If we were to introduce a procedure that in effect reproduced court procedures that are available for different matters, we would lose the advantage of a quick route to dealing with incipient problems.<br><br>
We intend to issue guidance for consultation, which will be finalised in time for commencement and which will cover the points raised. The amendments would add nothing to the Bill, so I must reject them.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 362</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given a brief and rather blunt response.
