	<div class='title'>MEANING OF "PUBLIC INTEREST DISCLOSURE"</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 7, leave out from 'which' to 'and' in line 9 insert
	<br><q><p>'because of the public interest, a court would not restrain (apart from this Act)'.</p></q>
Forgive me, Mr. Mills, if a trespassed on your role as our authority in the Chair. I shall, of course, be guided by you in all matters. I think that this is the first time that I have participated in a Standing Committee under your chairmanship. You and I have been friends for a long time—since 1979, I believe—and it is a pleasure for me and, I am sure, for all hon. Members, to have the Committee convened under your chairmanship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government Amendment No. 1 would improve and clarify the definition of "public interest disclosures" by making it clear that the term refers to existing case law dealing with cases in which the courts would not restrain a disclosure of confidential information. It would make the test an objective one and would cover cases that were not, formally, actions for breach of confidence—for example, breach of contract cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said on Second Reading, the Government have considerable sympathy with the aims and motives that underlie the Bill. However, we have serious concerns about its provisions and are by no means convinced that such broad and wide-ranging legislation is appropriate to deal with the problems that have been
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
identified. One of our main concerns is that many of the Bill's provisions are unclear in intention, uncertain in effect and unworkable in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1(a) is a prime example. It refers to a court finding a disclosure of information to be justified
	<br><q><p>"in an action for breach of confidence".</p></q>
That is simply not consistent with the way that established case law works. At present, there are cases in which the courts will not exercise their discretion to restrain a disclosure of information because they think that the disclosure is in the public interest—even though it will breach a duty of confidence that is in some way enforceable. However, the issue of whether a disclosure is in the public interest will not always or necessarily arise in an action for breach of confidence. The disclosure or proposed disclosure may give rise to some other action against the discloser, where the courts must consider whether it was made or should be made in the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The phrase
	<br><q><p>"a court has found, or would be likely to find"</p></q>
is also highly unsatisfactory. Surely the Bill is aimed at protecting employees who disclose information that is not yet in the public domain—not information where a court has already found disclosure to be in the public interest. To base the test on what a court would be likely to decide makes it a highly speculative and subjective proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that hon. Members will accept that it will help neither disclosers nor the organisations involved to enact a Bill that is a recipe for uncertainty and that, I am afraid, is what it is at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Touhig 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islwyn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the Minister and ease his burden by telling him that I accept almost all of the amendments that he has tabled this morning—24 out of 29. The only amendments on which we will be in contention are Nos. 15 and 16 to clause 1, Nos. 7 and 8 to clause 2 and No. 26 to clause 9. I am happy for the Minister to move all the other amendments formally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) is extremely obliging, but convention allows me, on behalf of the Government, to explain the reasoning behind the amendments. The House of Lords decision in the case of Pepper v. Hart makes it even more important that the record shows the Government's position. While I do not want to detain the Committee unduly, I want to speak to my amendments. Nevertheless, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not detain the Committee much longer on this matter, except to say that my amendment would greatly improve and clarify the clause. It would achieve three things: first, it would make clear that the definition of a public interest disclosure refers to the existing case law dealing with cases where the courts decline to restrain the disclosure of confidential information; secondly, it would make the test of what constitutes a disclosure in the public interest an objective one; and thirdly, it would extend the coverage of the Bill to cases such as breach of contract cases that are not formally actions for breach of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0610">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
confidence. Those changes are sensible and logical and are clearly in line with the Bill's stated intentions. They are intended to be helpful and I hope that the Committee will be prepared to accept the amendment in that spirit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Islwyn for bringing us together this morning. The Committee will be grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for making plain the Government's view and their proposals for improving the Bill if it is to become an Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister is right in saying that the amendment would improve the wording of the clause, create certainty and make the Bill more likely to be effective if matters are tested in court. However, the purpose of the clause is that matters should not necessarily be tested in court, because the position should be spelt out in such a way that people know what is allowable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without trespassing on the details of a case which may be in the courts now, I must say that I understand perfectly well that there are conflicts in serving the public interest. The clause makes plain what will be allowable for disclosure. It does not cover issues where information is provided in confidence to, for example, a Government body and where there is no question of malpractice. There are those who would suggest that the present issue of monopolies would be caught by these provisions, but it is clear that it would not be. There is no suggestion that the commercial information provided was hiding some public misdeed, so the limitations of the Bill should be understood by the Committee and those outside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is possible to continue to improve the Bill, we shall do the public a service by helping to ensure that where wrongdoing is known by one it can, if necessary and if other methods do not work, be made available to all. We should respect journalism, whose main task is to make available to all what is known to a few. Where there is serious wrongdoing which cannot be put right immediately, there should be a public interest defence for making the information available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By way of parenthesis, I said to those who were working with me when I was a junior Minister that if I was doing something wrong or misleading they should tell me first; if I did the same thing or something similar again, they should tell the permanent secretary; but if I did it a third time, they should tell 	<i>The Guardian.</i> As far as I know, no one ever bothered 	<i>The Guardian.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 10, leave out from "disclosure" to "in" line 12 and insert
	<br><q><p>"holds the information in confidence and acquired it".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following amendments: No. 3, in page 1, line 11, leave out "or or a claim".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No. 25, in clause 9, page 4, leave out lines 41 to 43.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 2 substitutes new wording in clause 1(b) to make it clear that the protected disclosures under the Bill are disclosures of information that is confidential at the time of disclosure and not information that, although confidential at the time it was acquired, is no longer so at the time of discosure. That is consistent with the general approach of the Bill, which is not intended to protect disclosures of non-confidential information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 3 is a limited version of amendment No. 2 and would fall if amendment No. 2 were accepted. Amendment No. 3 would amend clause 1(b) to remove from the coverage of protected disclosures information that is claimed to be, but is not, held in confidence. Amendment No. 25 has the same purpose and effect as amendment No. 3. It would delete from clause 9 a provision which would include within the Bill's coverage the disclosure of information subject to a claim of confidentiality that a court has failed to uphold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment Nos. 2, 3 and 25 relate to the type of information that can be the subject of a protected disclosure. As I understand it, the Bill's purpose is to provide protection in respect of disclosures of confidential information. That would produce the odd result of someone being able to obtain redress if he was penalised for disclosing confidential information, but not if he was penalised for disclosing non-confidential information. However, if that is the Bill's intended approach, it should at least be clear and consistent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As drafted, clause 1(b) would provide protection in respect of disclosures of information that was confidential at the time it was acquired, but is no longer so. It would also provide protection in respect of disclosures of information that was never confidential but was falsely claimed to be so. However, it would not provide protection in respect of disclosures of information that became confidential only after it was acquired. Amendment No. 2 would remove that confusion by providing that the protection applied only in respect of disclosures of information that was confidential at the time it was disclosed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will accept that clarification and the related amendment No. 25. That amendment would delete from clause 9 a provision that would bring within the Bill's coverage a disclosure of information subject to a claim of confidentiality that a court has failed to uphold. That provision is clearly subject to the same objection of inconsistency with the Bill's basic approach which relates to disclosure of confidential information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, however, the Committee is unwilling to accept amendment No. 2, I hope that it will at least accept the more limited amendment No. 3, along with amendment No. 25. Those amendments remove from the coverage of the Bill disclosures of information that is claimed to be, but is not, held in confidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of amendments Nos. 4, 6, 12, 14 and 23 would be to narrow the coverage of the Bill to the disclosure of information acquired in the course of employment. The amendments would remove from the Bill's protection those in the professions, self-employed workers and—except when they are employees—voluntary workers, members of organisations and office holders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 11 clarifies what the Bill means by a person being penalised for making a protected disclosure. It establishes that the protected disclosure may be the whole or part of the cause of the penalisation, rather than the principal cause, as in the Bill as drafted. It clarifies the definition of penalisation and brings it into line with similar provisions elsewhere in employment legislation. It makes it clear that the failure to carry out an action—for example, failure to promote someone—can count as penalisation, again in line with other provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 would delete from the Bill the provisions that enable individuals to obtain respectively a special award of compensation and interim relief from an industrial tribunal if they are unfairly dismissed or, in the case of interim relief, claim that they have been unfairly dismissed, for making a protected disclosure of information. The compensation would thus be limited to that available in ordinary unfair dismissal cases and interim relief—a temporary reappointment until the hearing of the case—would not be available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
The amendments have three distinct purposes and I shall deal with each in turn. Amendments Nos. 4, 9, 12, 14 and 23 are designed to go some way towards addressing one of the main difficulties that we have with the Bill—specifically, that its coverage is far too broad and ill-defined. That would not only cause confusion and uncertainty, but would place real and undesirable burdens on business. The five amendments are designed to limit the Bill to disclosures of information acquired during the course of employment. I hope to discuss that matter in more detail in the clause 4 stand part debate. Those amendments would, if accepted, remove from the Bill's coverage those in the professions and other self-employed workers, those engaged in voluntary work, members of organisations and office holders.

I acknowledge the exclusion already provided in clause 2(5) in respect of legal advisers—an exclusion that I am sure it is right to make—but the Bill appears none the less to cover all other professional advisers and to deal with them all in the same way. In fact, as I am sure all members of the Committee will accept, the responsibilities of different professional advisers very considerably. Different professions have different rules designed to fit their particular circumstances—for example, when and to whom a member of the profession may disclose information in breach of the duty of confidence that he owes to his client.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said on Second Reading, the Bill will cut across many of those professional rules. Its effect will be to impose blanket provisions on, for example, a matter that we shall deal with in later amendments—the steps that a whistleblower must take to raise a matter internally before coming within the Bill's protection. Most of the professions have their own well-developed rules on those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also remain concerned that the Bill may commit professional advisers to disclose confidential information, not just to a proper authority but more widely. It is unacceptable for the Bill to cut across professional rules that apply to the disclosure of confidential information. Those rules have been carefully worked out and refined over many years to suit the circumstances of particular professions and the Bill will impose different, and almost certainly unsuitable, standards across the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Different considerations apply in respect of voluntary workers, members of organisations and office holders. When such individuals are employees, my amendment would not affect their protection under the Bill. However, when they are not employees, it would not be right to extend such protection to them. To leave the Bill as it stands would make its coverage virtually limitless; everyone from a boy scout to a member of the Women's Institute would have the potential to take court action to obtain redress for perceived penalisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not deny that problems may sometimes arise for voluntary workers, members of organisations and others who are not employees, but who acquire information that they think should be made public. However, if there are such problems, they should be dealt with on a case-by-case basis—with legislation, if
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0612">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
appropriate, tailored particularly to their circumstances—and not by a broad and unspecific measure such as this Bill. The amendments would confine the Bill to the clearly denned and well-recognised ambit of employment protection legislation and I hope that the Committee will accept them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I need not detain the Committee long on amendment No. 11, which is intended to be helpful in clarifying the Bill's provisions and making them more effective. The amendment substitutes new wording for part of clause 3 and in doing so would achieve three things. First, it would establish that an individual is penalised within the meaning of the Bill if detrimental action were taken against him or her, wholly or partly because of a protected disclosure. That is in line with similar provisions elsewhere in employment legislation, for example, in the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 which protects people against detrimental treatment for taking certain action on health and safety grounds. It contrasts with the position under the Bill, in which the protection applies only to penalisation that arises principally because of a protected disclosure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second claim for the amendment is that it would clarify the definition of penalisation and establish that it covers any form of detrimental action, not just the specific forms listed in clause 3(2). Again, that would bring it into line with the wording of established legislation with which practitioners, industrial tribunals and others are already familiar and well used to dealing. Thirdly, it would make it clear that penalisation can include not only a deliberate act by an employer—dismissal or demotion, for example—but a deliberate failure to act, such as the failure to promote or to provide training. That would bring the Bill into line with similar provisions in existing legislation. All three of the effects that I have described would widen the Bill's coverage and make it more comprehensive and effective. I hope that in the light of my explanation, hon. Members will accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 relate to the remedies available to individuals from an industrial tribunal in unfair dismissal cases brought under the provisions of the Bill. They would have the effect of deleting from clause 5 the provisions that enable individuals in such cases to obtain respectively a special award of compensation and interim relief. The Bill seeks to build on the existing remedies provided for in the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 for health and safety representatives and committee members dismissed for taking certain types of action on health and safety grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These special remedies were introduced in recognition of the fact that victimisation is particularly serious where it is directed towards an individual who has been elected or recognised as a representative carrying out a specific role in relation to health and safety matters. They are not available to ordinary employees with no representative role who are victimised for taking action on health and safety
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
grounds. The remedies available to ordinary employees in such cases are the ordinary unfair dismissal remedies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that it would be right to extend the availability of special awards and interim relief—that is temporary reappointment until the hearing of the tribunal case—to employees victimised under the provisions of this Bill. They will have no special representative function or role in relation to whistleblowing and should not, therefore, have special remedies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not seek to understate the seriousness of unfair dismissal in those circumstances. However, there are many other types of unfair dismissal that are equally serious and no special provisions are made with regard to remedies in those cases. In the Government's view the ordinary unfair dismissal remedies are perfectly adequate and acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the sponsor of the Bill will want to say something on amendments Nos. 15 and 16; I should like to make a preliminary remark. The public interest areas might include someone who knew that a newspaper proprietor was raiding the pension funds of the companies that he had acquired. I regard that to be as important to the interests of past and present employees as health and safety work is. The Committee may encourage the Government to think again if amendments Nos. 15 and 16 are not accepted. An employee in an institution that cares for people full time, such as a children's home or a prison, may know something. Gross abuse of other people might need to fall under the same provisions as health and safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister has not convinced me about amendments Nos. 15 and 16, but he has convinced me about eliminating from the protection the right of someone holding a voluntary position to go to court. I had originally thought that it would be wrong to exclude such people. I can think of examples of people who have bravely challenged fellow members of a voluntary body, whether or not they were trustees. Some matters are not to do with confidentiality and public interest but may concern interpretation of the trust deed. I can think of an example of someone who took his fellow trustees to the High Court to determine the issue. That caused no problem between them and such actions should be encouraged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can think of another example in education where a voluntary body in effect gave pay increases late in people's working careers which allowed the teacher's pension fund to give someone an unwarranted advantage on retirement at the cost of other pensioners and potential pensioners. When that became public—through the actions of a Government Department, as it happens—one trustee was not reappointed. It was not a direct action by those who objected to what he had done. In fact, he was absolutely right, as subsequent rule changes have made plain. As there is not a right to be appointed in a voluntary capacity, there should not be a right to go to court.

There are times when people are called on to make certain sacrifices, whether of prestige or, more importantly, on something to which they are committed. However, if the greater good is served by the disclosure of confidential information, those serving in a voluntary capacity should be willing to accept that. I accept the way that my hon. Friend the Minister has put the exclusions across. He and those who have drafted the amendments have done a service. A degree of clarity in how a court will rule is important to the individual who may be saying internally, "I need to make this information available and, by the way, I expect it will be covered by the Bill when it becomes an Act."

I apologise for not being able to be present for the whole of this morning's sitting. I am sorry to appear hyperactive, but we are making significant progress, and it is important that we should.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already told the Minister that I am prepared to accept amendments Nos. 4, 9, 11, 12, 14 and 23, so I shall confine my remarks to amendments Nos. 15 and 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 15 would mean that the maximum compensatory award that an employee could receive would be £11,300, even if he were blacklisted and could not work again. Removing the ceiling would not mean that underselling employees would receive large sums of money—they would have to demonstrate and prove that they had suffered a substantial loss. There are no limits to the compensation that tribunals can award under the Race Relations Act 1976, the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. That is because there is a clear public interest in deterring the conduct covered by such legislation. Surely, there is just such a public interest in deterring the punishment of an employee who has acted in a way that Parliament would want and who has been alert about and checked on crime or serious malpractice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister's amendments are accepted, employees who are victimised, but not dismissed, can claim unlimited compensation because clause 5(4)(a) would survive. However, those who are sacked would be able to claim no more than £11,300. That anomally may prove an incentive to an organisation to dismiss an employee who has raised a concern and when, for example, his colleagues object to working with him because he has reported malpractice by one of them. That is unfair and unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 16 would delete the provision for interim relief, which would mean that there would be no opportunity for an employee to ask to stop a reprisal. The provision for interim relief would give an organisation time to consider what may have been an over-hasty decision to shoot the messenger when, in fact, he was a conscientious employee. Such a provision would be particularly important in those
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
cases when an employee was dismissed within the two-month period that the Minister proposes should be given to the organisation to investigate the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Interim relief orders are currently available only to employees dismissed on trade union grounds, to health and safety representatives and to health and safety committee members. Their purpose is to secure the swift return to work of someone who has been victimised for one of those reasons and when it is not possible to preserve the status quo by continuing the employee's contract until a full hearing has been held. The justification is that prevention is better than cure. The Minister is a lawyer, so he will recognise that such an order is cheaper than holding a full hearing. I have outlined the reasons why I oppose amendments No. 15 and 16.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Makerfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a few short remarks on amendments Nos. 15 and 16. The Minister fails to recognise the importance of ensuring that the potential victim of a crime—the whistleblower—is protected. A whistleblower is someone who acts within the law to expose criminal activities, which may lead to indictable offences, or serious malpractices, such as fraud or actions that lead to criminal prosecutions under the health and safety or other appropriate legislation. Given those circumstances, it is inappropriate that the person who is prepared to operate within the law to expose an actual or potential criminal activity, and not the criminal, is the person discriminated against. I see this not as an employment rights issue, but as an issue involving the prevention of crime. It relates to people who prevent crimes that may have led to companies being defrauded, sometimes of millions or tens of millions of pounds, and customers being defrauded of the provision of potential goods and services. What is the biggest burden on a company—the continuation of a fraud that eats away at the heart of the company and destabilises it, or the right, in some circumstances, for employees, acting within the law, to be protected if action is taken against them precipitately to prevent that fraud from being put in the public domain?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give the Minister two examples of such cases—one is not so recent, although we are still feeling the effects of it, and the other is very recent. In the first case, the internal auditor of BCCI was sacked in July 1990. As a consequence, the directors were able to continue for almost 11 months with a fraud that led to billions of pounds of assets flowing out of the United Kingdom, hundreds of millions of pounds being lost by council taxpayers and local authorities and many small businesses going bankrupt. If there had been provision for a disclosure, the auditor could have applied for interim relief and, at that point, BCCI could not have continued to keep the extent of the fraud out of the public domain. As a consequence of the auditor's sacking and the lack of any provision for the auditor or any other employee to seek interim relief, the employer was able to continue with the massive fraud, for which we are still paying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the second case, the country almost lost a £40 million investment. A company decided to invest outside the United Kingdom because of continual
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0614">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
unrecognisable or uncontractable losses at its Manchester base. The company's line management, which was involved in the fraud, was also responsible for the employment status of the employee who eventually proved the £1.2 million annual fraud. In those circumstances, the employee was unable, for a period of time, to put the fraud into the public domain because of the consequences for his employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments undermine even further the position of such employees. They encourage fraudsters to continue defrauding; they encourage line managers who have deliberately hidden the fraud from senior managers to get rid of the whistleblower and to continue to defraud the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These provisions would not be a burden on business, but would protect company directors as well as their employees. I hope that the Minister will seriously reconsider the amendments and their consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the Minister is right to say that interim relief is given only in certain key circumstances. This is not a party political issue and we are not suggesting that we should use this piece of legislation to change the provisions willy-nilly in other primary legislation. However, the circumstances that we are discussing are serious enough to extend, on a limited basis, the access to interim relief proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn. Interim relief would have saved that Manchester company alone the £40 million of potential investment. It would have cost the company little, because interim hearings are not expensive compared with full-scale hearings. It would provide senior directors who were not involved in the fraud with the same protection mechanism as the whistleblower.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will reconsider the amendments and, if he cannot withdraw them, at least sit down with my hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn before Report and redraft them. As they stand, they inadvertently help the criminal at the expense of those who are acting within the law and being public spirited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We seem to have at least three major and distinct issues to deal with in this group of amendments—the nature of penalisation, the narrowing of the categories of those who may be protected under this measure and the remedies available to them. I should like to say something on the latter two issues, partly as a way of seeking clarification of the Minister's intentions, but certainly to support the arguments of my hon. Friends the Members for Islwyn and for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On interim relief, although I understand the Minister's desire not to introduce gratuitous anomalies into employment protection law, it none the less seems that in this case he would be justified in making a differentiation because of the public interest factor. The object of the Bill is, after all, to protect the public interest. I ask the Minister to consider and, indeed, to acknowledge that failure to make interim relief available would make it more likely that any malpractice would continue. Although an employee can take his or her chance in securing a remedy in law
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
in due course after having been dismissed, in the meantime the malpractice that the employee has observed and wishes to expose could continue. That is a serious deficiency in the Minister's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister's clarification on the categories of those who may be protected under the Bill. It would be helpful if he would listen, as I wish to ask him two specific questions to which I hope he will respond. What would happen, under his proposals, in the case of a relatively junior member of a team of auditors who believed that senior members of the team were casting a blind eye or, indeed, condoning something taking place in the firm being audited that was unsatisfactory and against the public interest? Is the Minister proposing that the conduct of that junior member of the team should be governed by the rules of self-regulation or the applicable legislative provisions? That could involve a relatively long-drawn-out procedure which would, in effect, act as a constraint on that person exposing malpractice. In such an example, malpractice would be occurring simultaneously in the firm being audited and the firm of auditors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have described a hypothetical situation which the Minister may say is improbable. However, such a state of affairs can by no means be ruled out. We all attach enormous importance to audit—I sometimes think that we place an almost blind trust in it as a kind of witchcraft to persuade ourselves that malpractice does not occur in companies. Certainly, we should do nothing to diminish its effectiveness. How would the Minister's amendment affect such a situation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, what does the Minister envisage may occur in voluntary organisations? Many have large assets and turn over considerable sums of money but have small professional staffs, whose members may be exposed to temptation. A volunteer associated with an organisation or working for it in an unpaid capacity could become aware of malpractice. Plainly, as volunteers are not employees, the legislation governing employment protection cannot apply to them. None the less, a volunteer could be subject to harassment and degrees of unjustified treatment such as various sorts of victimisation and penalisation as a result of having exposed something that professional staff in an organisation did not want exposed. A volunteer could not be unfairly dismissed, but could certainly suffer unpleasant consequences at a personal level. A volunteer exposing malpractice needs protection and I got the impression from what the Minister said that there would not be protection for a volunteer acting in the public interest in such a situation. It would be unfortunate if that were to be the effect of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Tony Wright 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cannock and Burntwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, but I rise in a spirit of innocence because I do not yet know whether the Minister is being helpful to the progress of the Bill. No doubt we shall discover that in the next hour or two. I am sure that he will be helpful. I am not at all persuaded by any of the Minister's remarks. I shall not dwell on those that I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0615">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
find unobjectionable, and which are accepted by the promoter of the Bill, but only on those with which we have difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the Minister's first points, it cannot be right simply to say that we must let professions do what they will. Surely we should set base lines and say that professions must meet certain public interest obligations. Why did the Government introduce the Medical (Professional Performance) Bill if they were not dissatisfied with the way in which consultants and their professional performance were being monitored by the General Medical Council? Of course we, as a Parliament, have an obligation to make sure that professions meet certain obligations. When professionals are involved in organisations and issues arise which have a public interest dimension, I am not at all persuaded that we should leave such matters to the professions. They act in their own way and make up things as they go along. They will all be diverse and different, and that is a splendid diversity, but it cannot be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) has said, there will be a range of cases where people who are involved in voluntary organisations will come upon information which has a public interest resonance. They need to know that they will not be victimised if they do something about it. We do not have to think hard to think of such cases. For example, people involved in the Scouts might find that a Scout master is abusing small children. Those circumstances are not unknown. We have to be able to say to such people that if they try to do something about that, they will not suffer all manner of consequences. They are acting for us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not use such cases lightly, but we can think of the monster of Dunblane, who was involved with small children. In that case the Scout Association responded rightly when it came to its attention that something was amiss. If it had not done so and someone had wanted to raise that as a public interest matter, they should have been able to so without the fear of reprisal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the major amendments Nos. 15 and 16, my point is straightforward and simple, and I hope that it will persuade the Committee that the Minister's remarks miss the point. The basis of the Bill is that there is something special about public interest disclosure. We are not talking here simply about the normal relationships between an employer and an employee, where the only interests involved are those of that employer and employee. Employment law is structured to deal with those individual relationships. The point about the category of cases about which we are talking is that there is a public interest dimension to the issue. That should be reflected in the provisions that employment law makes in dealing with those cases. When employment law makes special provision for compensation or interim relief arrangements, that is a recognition that the case does not involve a normal employment relationship—there is something extra. That extra is what the Bill is all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
That argument is so fundamental that it cannot be trumped by the Minister simply standing up and talking about "burdens on business". It is too important for that. I hope that, on reflection, the Minister will come to understand that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to respond to the hon. Members for Makerfield, for Cannock and Burntwood (Dr. Wright) and for Stratford-on-Avon. I take my cue in particular from the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood, who asked me in what spirit I came to our proceedings this morning. I come to the proceedings with an anxiety to help the Bill into a better form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I need not restate the Government's misgivings about the Bill. I articulated those on Second Reading—the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood participated in that debate. I am wholly appreciative of the Committee's—and especially the promoter's—readiness to accept a large number of the amendments. If I may say so with appropriate humility, I think that the Committee is wise to take that attitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should, however, take the opportunity to point out that our amendments are not necessarily in an ideal form from a legal point of view. In the time available, they have been drafted in a form that raises and signals the Government's concerns so that they can be sensibly debated by the Committee, but I do not claim that the amendments are perfect. I say that particularly in response to the hon. Member for Makerfield. I concede that it may be necessary to revisit the subject of some of our amendments again at later stages in the Bill's progress, when the Government and—if I may say so in the name of reality—parliamentary counsel have had time to consider further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my response will be regarded as an exercise in reality. We all know that it is in the nature of the legislative process for improvement to evolve upon improvement. That is the spirit that I bring to our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question whether there should be a ceiling on compensation is rather a different matter from the point dealt with by amendment No. 15. The Bill does not provide for unlimited compensation but for a special award, which I consider inappropriate, for the reasons that I gave—because, in other words, the individual has no representative role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to the arguments in favour of the proposition that special awards and interim relief should be available in the circumstances specified in the Bill, but I remain unconvinced that we should make a radical change to the structure of employment protection law. Of course, there may be hard cases in which an employee is penalised for making a disclosure, but there can be equally hard cases of unfair dismissal for other reasons. The tribunals are used to dealing with those. It is a cliche that hard cases make bad law, but it is often true. We should not allow our judgment to be swayed by the fact that one can imagine hard cases arising in this context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a technical question. Is it not the case at the moment that when someone makes an application for interim relief it is not automatically granted and the person has to convince the chair of the tribunal that the application is neither vexatious nor an attempt to get round the full-blown procedures? If that is the case—I have not sat on tribunals for some time—the provision would not be a burden; it would simply give access to the chairman of the tribunal to consider whether, in the circumstances, an interim relief hearing should take place—no more, no less than that. There would be no automatic right under the current procedures for interim relief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly prepared to reflect on that. The hon. Gentleman, who is well versed in tribunal law and was, unnecessarily, slightly self-deprecating, offered an analysis that is almost certainly correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood specifically referred to the Medical (Professional Performance) Bill. I offer to him the comment that that Bill is an ideal example of the approach that I am advocating: where perceived problems arise outside employment, they should be dealt with on a case-by-case basis and covered by specific legislation which is tailored to their specific circumstances and not by a blanket measure such as that before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You, Mr. Mills, will have gathered that I intend to press amendments Nos. 15 and 16, but I shall do so in the spirit of the remarks that I have made about working on getting the texts of the amendments as good as we can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon referred to the position of auditors. I am the first to concede that there is an interest in auditors properly reporting to the authorities any serious irregularity that they come across. In fact, auditors in the regulated sector—banks, building societies, insurance companies and financial services—have a statutory duty to report such matters. Auditors outside the regulated sector, however, rely on the protection that exists in common law. We need longer to consider how the Bill would affect their interests and whether a further amendment is necessary. We might need to table amendments at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of the amendments can be summarised as follows. Amendment No. 5 restricts the significant misconduct or malpractice covered by the Bill to the matters set out in the schedule. Amendment No. 28 removes paragraph (iii)—"abuse of authority"—from the schedule. Amendment No. 29 removes paragraph (v)—"maladministration"—from the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I made clear on Second Reading and have made clear today, the Government have considerable sympathies with the objectives of the Bill, but cannot support legislation that would create such a burden on business. I apologise to the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood, who does not regard that argument as significant enough. The Government, however, regard it as significant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is all the more burdensome—to my mind unacceptably so—because of the enormous uncertainty about its effect. It is not confined to the matters that are set out in the schedule, but leaves it up to the court to determine what constitutes significant misconduct or malpractice. The type of misconduct that the Bill might cover is loosely drawn. It is potentially limitless, because wide as the matters in the schedule are, they are only examples. In any one case, individuals would not know whether they would be protected, because they would be unlikely to be experts in judging what the courts might consider to be in the public interest. Employers would be equally uncertain.

The circumstances giving rise to protection are crucial. In many cases, the employer as well as the individual would not know whether protection applied until it was too late, the disclosure having been made and the court asked to decide. The Government's concern is that the Bill could be interpreted as conferring sweeping rights to disclose confidential information that it would not be lawful to disclose at present. That is clearly not the intention of the Bill, which, as I understand it, is intended merely to extend protection to disclosures of information that are already lawful. In the interests of clarity and certainty, the words
	<br><q><p>"including but not limited to that"</p></q>
in page 1, line 17, should be deleted. I have already, when arguing to amend clause 1(c) so that "significant misconduct or malpractice" refers only to matters set out in the schedule, made it clear that it is essential that there should be no uncertainty about the matters to be covered by the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even within the schedule, the type of misconduct that the Bill might cover is loosely drawn. My main concerns relate to paragraphs (iii), which refers to "abuse of authority" and (v), which refers to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0617">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
"maladministration". What does "abuse of authority" mean? As far as I am aware, there is no legal definition of that term. Nor is there a clear, agreed understanding about what it covers. That is clearly unsatisfactory. Employers and employees must understand clearly what constitutes a ground for a "public interest disclosure". For that reason, line 7 of the schedule should be deleted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Maladministration is a term which is widely understood in the public sector. Ombudsmen investigate complaints by members of the public that maladministration has led to injustice. However, the term "maladministration" is not legally defined. It is subject to occasional redefinition by, for example, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, and can cover such a matter as simple rudeness. It is not inconceivable that, for example, rudeness by a public official could be a ground for a public interest disclosure. The alleged shortcoming and the remedy for it simply do not match up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1(c) would obviously encourage individuals to believe that any disclosure relating to the matters in the schedule to the Bill was necessarily to be regarded as in the public interest. It is essential, therefore, that the matters set out in the schedule should not be misleading or uncertain. For that reason, line 9 of the schedule should be deleted.

I trust that in the light of my explanation, the Committee will be prepared to accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make some general comments, but, first, may I say that it is a pleasure to sit on a Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Mills. This is my first private Member's Bill—I do not know whether it will be the first of many—and it is the first Standing Committee on which I have sat in the expectation of taking part to a great degree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is important and it deserves to reach the statute book and to become law. I stress that its title is the Public Interest Disclosure Bill because it is about protecting the public interest. It is not solely about employee's rights as might be construed from the Minister's amendments. On Second Reading, the Bill was carried by 118 votes to nil, and hon. Members clearly demonstrated a groundswell of support for such a measure. Moreover, the many messages of support that I have received show that the Bill commands widespread support in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have consulted widely on the Bill and I note that in his response to the previous amendments, the Minister referred to the burdens on industry. That issue is of concern to the Government, but it is of concern to all of us. The President of the Board of Trade told me that he had not consulted anyone about the Bill and that he Hid not intend to do so, either. Therefore, I am not sure for whom the Minister is speaking. After the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
consultations I have had with business and industry, I believe that I am a little more justified than the Minister in saying that I am speaking for their interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill seeks to ensure that people who discover crime, fraud or serious malpractice are protected in law from reprisals when they act in the public interest and try to do something about such conduct. It is as simple as that. With such protection in place, it is hoped that people will be less likely to be deterred from raising concerns about serious malpractice or misconduct. Far from creating new burdens on business and industry—a problem suggested, but not substantiated by critics of the Bill—the Bill will allow responsible employers and managers the opportunity to rectify bad practice and to avoid costly long-term damage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will protect only those individuals who act responsibly. It contains several safeguards to ensure that organisations will not be hostage to personal grudges and paranoid whims, and I know that the Government are concerned about that. The Minister made that point well on Second Reading, but he may reflect that some of his amendments are in danger of turning the Bill into a whingers' charter. Indeed, some of his amendments may add to the regulatory burdens on business and industry, and the sponsors of the Bill and the Government are keen to avoid that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will offer protection only to someone who has satisfied four key conditions: he must have raised the matter internally; he must have good reason to believe that the information is accurate; he must not have acted in bad faith; he must not have sold the story for profit. It is a reasonable, responsible and much-needed piece of legislation, and that belief is clearly shared by the 118 of us who voted for it on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had an excellent debate on Second Reading. It was one of the best I have seen and it showed the House of Commons at its best. Not only was the measure supported by hon. Members from both sides of the House, but the debate was such that the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Luff) said that he had come to the debate as a sceptic, but then proclaimed that he was now a convert and supported the measure. The Minister himself said that it had been one of the most interesting debates that he had had the privilege of listening to in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the unopposed Second Reading, it is right that Bill should pass through Committee as quickly as possible so it can return to the Floor of the House for further debate. It is inappropriate that valuable Committee time should be taken up on Bills that were unopposed in the House. I am sure that such time will not be spent on the Treasure Bill that is being debated in another Committee Room this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister is willing to make considerable progress this morning. I do not expect him to offer co-operation without a proper response from me and I have already said that I am happy to accept 24 of the Minister's 29 amendments. I would have gladly consulted the Government in detail on the drafting of the Bill. I made the offer but for various
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0618">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
reasons the Government were unable to respond at that stage. I am still willing to do that. The sponsors of the Bill are still willing to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noted in particular the Minister's remarks on Second Reading when he said that the Government had a particular approach to good legislation. He said it had to be set against the criteria set down by the deregulation task force and that it must avoid unnecessary burdens on business and industry. That is a goal which the sponsors and I share with the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, to speed progress and to demonstrate our willingness, I repeat my offer to the Minister that I am prepared to accept almost all the amendments. I realise that we cannot take them out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I regret to have to stop my good friend in his tracks, but I am advised that as he raising questions about amendments Nos. 28 and 29 which are not to clause 1 they cannot be debated in the clause stand part debate.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reply to the hon. Member for Swindon (Mr. Coombs) at a later stage. I would say further to the Minister that if we can complete our deliberations in Committee this morning I would welcome the opportunity to sit down with him and his officials to see what we can do to improve the Bill. If we can agree a common approach the Bill could command widespread support on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that the amendments on which we may not get agreement this morning will, if left as they stand, do considerable harm to industrial relations and place unnecessary burdens on business and industry. I say that with confidence, as I have consulted representatives of business and industry. It is not that the principles behind the amendments are wrong but their drafting is fundamentally flawed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My concern is that those amendments, if accepted as they stand, would remove the key provisions from the Bill and render it pretty ineffective. That is clearly not the wish of the House which endorsed the measure with powerful support. I believe that it is not the Minister's intention, at least I hope not, so in the spirit of co-operation I make this offer of collaboration. So that we can proceed even more speedily. I am prepared to accept most of his amendments. We could then get down to those on which we disagree and perhaps make some progress in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to respond to the contributions that have been made in the clause stand part debate, notably by the hon. Member for Islwyn. I have made it clear already that I have considerable
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
sympathy for the underlying intention of the Bill, the Government's concerns are about the wide scope, the lack of clarity and possible burdens on business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the committee for the sympathetic hearing that it has given to my amendments to the clause. These have gone some way to improving the Bill and I look forward to discussing subsequent clauses in the same spirit. But there is one issue that should not be allowed to pass. The hon. Member for Islwyn has told us of the support that the Bill has received from business. Perhaps I might be permitted to make a couple of points about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, we welcome employers who are prepared to meet the costs of introducing their own systems and we would encourage them to do so, but we do not consider it right to impose blanket legislation on all employers requiring those who cannot afford the burdens to bear them along with those who can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I invite the hon. Gentleman to examine carefully the terms in which employers have offered support. In general I believe that he will find that they support the principle that individuals who raise matters of public interest through appropriate channels should not be penalised as a result. As I have said, who indeed could fail to support such a principle? That is probably why none of the letters that my Department received about the Bill objected to it. However, once employers examine the proposed legislation in a little detail, they may express considerable doubts and fears about the practicalities of such a measure, for the very reasons that I have just indicated. The Government have doubts too. That may be why only one of the letters of support to my Department has been from an employer or employers' organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 6 would amend clause 2(1)(c) to disapply the Bill's protection in cases where disclosure of information had been made to any extent for the purpose of obtaining payment or personal gain. Amendment No. 7 would impose on an individual a new specific requirement to raise a concern internally with the person to whom the duty of confidentiality was owed. It would replace clause 2(1)(d) of the Bill as drafted, which simply requires the individual to take "reasonable steps" to raise the matter internally. The concern would have to be raised in writing, and the employee would be unable to benefit from the Bill's protection until two months had elapsed during which the person with whom it had been raised had taken no significant steps to investigate the matter in question. Amendment No. 8 would make a minor consequential change to clause 2(4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments in this group address two quite distinct aspects of clause 2, so I shall deal with them separately. First, I shall deal with amendment No. 6, which could to some extent perhaps be described as a probing amendment. As drafted, clause 2(1)(c) disapplies the Bill's protection in cases in which disclosure of information has been made principally for the purpose of obtaining payment or personal gain. I imagine that one such situation might be when an employee sells a story to a newspaper, motivated solely by the offer of a large cheque in return. I certainly agree that an individual in those circumstances should not benefit from the Bill's protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am, however, intrigued by the inclusion of the word "principally". I take that to mean that when someone has disclosed information partly with the aim of obtaining personal gain, albeit partly with other motives as well, he or she is to be covered by the Bill. If one accepts that a disclosure is, as it were, tainted when it is made solely for personal gain, it seems to me to be rather odd to take the position that it is acceptable when it is made only partly for such gain. Amendment No. 6 addresses that point. By deleting the word "principally" in clause 2(1)(c) it would disapply the Bill's protection in cases in which disclosure of information had been made to any extent whatever for the purpose of obtaining payment or personal gain. Of course, that begs the question of how the courts—never mind employers—can reasonably be expected to know what a person's motivations were for a particular disclosure. As I said on Second
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
Reading, those may be finely balanced and difficult to determine. I should be interested to know the thinking of the Bill's supporters on those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to amendments Nos. 7 and 8. As I hope I have made clear, the Government, while broadly agreeing with the principles of the Bill, see considerable difficulties in going down the road of legislation. In particular, we believe that people should be encouraged to put their own houses in order, without the constraint of statute. That is especially true for employers running their businesses. Only in particular and extreme circumstances, when that approach does not work, should legislation be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Supporters of the Bill have made much of the fact that it does not require organisations to introduce new procedures. However, as it stands, the Bill leaves wide open what steps, taken by an individual, will be sufficient to justify disclosure. The effect of amendment No. 7 would be to impose on an individual a new specific requirement to raise an anxiety internally with the person to whom the obligation of confidentiality is owed before becoming eligible to benefit from the Bill's protection for making the concern public. It would replace clause 2(1)(d) of the Bill, which simply requires the individual to take reasonable steps to raise the matter internally and would, in the Government's view, be unacceptably vague and uncertain in effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the procedure envisaged in my amendment, the concern would have to be raised internally in writing, and the employee would be unable to benefit from the Bill's protection until two months had elapsed during which the person with whom it had been raised had taken no significant steps to investigate the matter in question. Amendment No. 8 would make a minor consequential change to clause 2(4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should say that I am not wedded to the precise details of the procedure set out in amendment No. 7. It may well be that it could be improved. Indeed, if the Committee should accept the amendment, as I hope that it will, the Government might seek to refine it on Report—for example, by clarifying what is meant by "significant steps". My purpose in tabling the amendment is to prompt a debate on what I consider to be an extremely important aspect of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As members of the Committee will be well aware, one of the Government's chief concerns about the Bill is that it would impose unjustified additional burdens on business. Our firm belief is that internal procedures are the best way of dealing with problems of the kind that the Bill seeks to address, and that employees should always have to follow such procedures before considering whether to breach an obligation of confidentiality by talking to the press or to some other third party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is needed is to create and encourage a climate of openness and dialogue within businesses, so that employees are encouraged to express their reasonable concerns and constructive comments are welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0620">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
I note that the organisation Public Concern at Work agrees with me on this point. In its submission to the Nolan committee it noted:
	<br><q><p>"Rather than advocate that the whistle should be blown outside, our pre-eminent aim is that the concern should be raised internally with those accountable for the organisation".</p></q>
That comment was, of course, made in relation to the public sector which, when we come to a later amendment, the Government will seek largely to exclude from the coverage of the Bill, but the point is, generally, valid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should mention that although my amendment, in effect, retains clause 2(2) of the Bill, the Government are by no means convinced of the merits of that provision. Proponents of the Bill have expressed the view that it would be preferable for all organisations to have in place suitable internal procedures for raising concerns so that whistleblowing to an external organisation would, in most cases, not be necessary. I agree with that. However, the clause would allow an individual to circumvent the internal mechanism and instead claim protection because a fellow employee had previously raised the same concern and been penalised for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Government's view that constitutes a wholly unrealistic provision. How can one employee possibly know the full reasons behind any disciplinary action taken against another employee? Personnel matters are confidential and it is essential that they remain so. The subsection could only encourage individuals to act on the basis of office hearsay and rumour. It is unsatisfactory that the Bill should encourage an individual to think that reliance on that will give him or her protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An employee may have raised his concerns internally and have received a satisfactory explanation, or the organisation might be taking steps to remedy the situation as a result of the concerns being raised. That individual might then be disciplined for another, legitimate and unconnected reason. How is a second employee expected to guess from that whether he gains protection against disclosure under the provision when he has to rely on a perception of what happened to his colleague or on the testimony of an aggrieved individual without first raising his concerns with his employer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the clause, the motive of the individual is a factor to be taken into account in deciding whether an employee should have protection. But the provision allows an individual to rely on steps taken by a colleague whose motives are not taken into account. That colleague might have acted in bad faith; he might have been penalised not for raising his concerns, but, for example, because he sought to blackmail his employer as a result of the confidential information he had obtained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill stands, none of that would be taken into account. An individual can merely claim protection on the basis of his understanding of what has been going on, perhaps in a different part of the organisation. It is essential that the misconduct or malpractice is raised internally in all cases before protection is offered under
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
the Bill. Therefore, I give notice that the Government will put forward another amendment on that point on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the attempt made in clause 2(1)(d) to point individuals towards raising concerns internally before disclosing them publicly. However, that does not go far enough. Its effect is uncertain, as it would rely on an industrial tribunal for a court's interpretation of what was reasonable. Government amendments Nos. 7 and 8 would remedy that and I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already said that I am happy to accept amendment No. 6. I cannot accept amendments Nos. 7 and 8. I welcome much of what the Minister said, but cannot relate it to the amendments he has tabled. They do not seem to deal with the same matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 will not deter malpractice in an organisation. The employer will have only to investigate the matter. He will be under no obligation to take any reasonable steps to remedy the malpractice. One could picture Robert Maxwell or Peter Clowes investigating concerns raised by their employees about defrauding pensioners or shareholders and then telling the person who brought the matter forward, "That's all right, my boy; I've looked it up and there is nothing in it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an individual then blew the whistle in such circumstances, he would be offered no protection. Under the Government's amendments, the organisation would simply have to say that the matter had been looked into and there was nothing in it, and it would not have to do any more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely what happened in the Maxwell scandal. Employees who raised concerns were not only sacked, but removed as trustees of the pension funds. They had no protection, or any remedy for their situation or for the fraud that was taking place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is referring to Harry Templeton, who served on the pension fund management board of the Maxwell organisation and raised matters of concern with Maxwell. He was hounded out of his job—he was dismissed—and out of the industry. The Government amendments would offer no protection to such an individual, provided that the organisation said that the matter had been looked into and no further steps were needed. The fraud could, therefore, continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is to be the approach to the Bill, it must be incumbent on an organisation to take reasonable steps to remedy any malpractice or misconduct that is found. That is essential to the core of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendments Nos. 7 and 8 will encourage aggressive and inappropriate conduct among employees. A reasonable employee will want the concern that he has raised to be looked into and addressed. If he is unable to raise it with his line manager, he might want to raise it with a senior person in the organisation. He will not raise the matter, as the amendments require, by writing to the chairman or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0621">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
chief executive at the outset, stipulating that the matter should be disclosed in the public interest. That is not what we seek to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ran a small company before I came into the House. If the Bill, amended as the Minister intends, had been in operation then and one of my employees had contacted me to say X, Y or Z was happening in the organisation and ought to be exposed in the public interest, I would have thought that there was something wrong with the relationship between myself and that employee. That would seem threatening and intimidating. Yet the provisions in the Minister's amendment would require the employee to say that the matter should be disclosed in the public interest, rather than seeking to resolve the issue before the crime or the malpractice takes place. The amendment is extraordinary in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would impose greater burdens than will the provisions that it seeks to replace. The fact that the employee would have to write to the person to whom he owes the duty of confidence means that he should raise his concern with the board of the company or the head of the quango concerned. That would cut across all the effective internal reporting schemes set up by leading British companies such as Esso, Lucas and NatWest. They have already set in place mechanisms by which employees can bring serious wrongdoing to the attention of the company and its management. The Minister's amendment would involve a protracted method of writing letters to the board saying that a matter ought to be exposed in the public interest. That takes us away from the spirit and the principle of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, the amendments are inconsistent with the Nolan recommendation, which the Government have accepted, that public bodies should designate someone within their organisations to listen to matters of this nature raised by employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would be inappropriate in cases where individuals or the community faced grave dangers. For example, a child might be sexually abused while in care, but if an employee brought that to the attention of the organisation, it would have two months in which to respond—two months in which the abuse might continue. On an environmental issue, the organisation would have two months to respond to a matter that threatened the environment and our community. That is an extraordinary and bureaucratic way to approach the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would also mean that regulatory bodies such as the Health and Safety Executive and the social services inspectorate would be cut out. If the Minister's amendments were accepted, an employee who went to those bodies, as the regulators in a particular field or industry, would lose any protection. I hope that the Minister will reflect on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was encouraged by the Minister's remarks and reiterate my offer that, if we can make speedy progress in Committee this morning, I shall be delighted to sit down with him and his officials to see how we can
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
improve the Bill by Report stage and table amendments that would have the support of the whole House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not follow the excellent case put by my hon. Friend in answer to the Minister on amendments Nos. 7 and 8, but I should like to put a few points to the Minister. First, to be fair to him and the way in which he spoke to the amendments, he was brutally honest with the Committee. I have been in this place for almost nine years and I have never known a Minister to move probing amendments between Second Reading and Committee stage. Usually the Minister's probing takes place in discussions with the promoter and sponsors of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it would be extraordinary for a probing amendment to be made to a Bill. We take it as read from the Minister that these amendments are probing amendments, soliciting information from the sponsors of the Bill. It would, therefore, be totally inappropriate to pass amendments Nos. 7 and 8. As the Minister said without being pressured, the amendments would in any event be amended because they are inadequate. In truth, they are not only inadequate, they inadvertently provide an escape route for criminals and potential criminals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister, as a solicitor in another life, knows that in the run-up to prosecution, there is a vital period for collection and dissemination of information. The information needs to be secured in an appropriate way so that fraud is identified or prevented and so that if appropriate, legal action can be taken to remedy criminal activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can imagine the effect, in a range of instances, of a two-month early warning system for the criminal. The Manchester case is one example—but there are hundreds. Unfortunately, year by year in the court system, such cases proliferate. Supposing that a line management were involved in a disturbing and well-documented fraud which, monthly and yearly, undermined the company's operating capability, the junior employees' direct responsibilities to that line management would result in a two-month period in which to rectify the wrongdoing and criminal activity. The Minister is a criminal lawyer and knows how the criminal mind works, and he will know that that period would be devastating for the employee, who would be sacked and who, under an amendment previously debated, would be unable to seek interim relief. Under current procedures it would be at least nine months before the tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the two-month period, the employee having been sacked, other senior employees would continue either to defraud the company or to wind down the fraud and go off with their ill-gotten gains, or take other action that would render it difficult to remedy the matter later. That cannot be right and I do not think that it is the Minister's intention in moving the probing amendment. In probing the matter he has uncovered something nasty. He should replace the cover and get down to serious discussions with the hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Duncan Smith) and my hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn, the promoter of the Bill. If the Minister harbours a serious doubt, he should come up
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0622">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
with a workable solution that would not provide a remedy in law for the criminal, as his present proposal would.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, with respect to criminal activity, the Minister gave an example concerning putting a matter in writing. There is already evidence in the public domain that that process is inadequate. The House has just passed legislation on a set of quite complex regulatory proposals following the Lyme bay canoe tragedy. The reason for that is that the processes that the Minister has outlined were precisely those used in relation to the tragedy. Employees in the company concerned had to place before their line manager, in writing, their complaints about health and safety or other matters. They followed that to the letter. The problem was that the responsible person in that company was the one who was carrying out the malpractices that led to the grave offences under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974. The deaths led to a charge on an indictable offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the lessons that led to the Activity Centres (Young Persons' Safety) Act 1995—and in fairness, not only did the Government give it a fair wind and support its promoter, the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson), but they and the relevant Department did a great deal of work to get the Bill and its regulatory regime right—it is extraordinary that the Minister should reject that experience and ask us to accept the probing amendment. Experience shows that such proposals would be inadequate for the circumstances that have been outlined. I ask the Minister to withdraw amendments Nos. 7 and 8 now that they have had their probing effect. The Bill's sponsors have accepted amendment No. 6. It is hoped that we shall be able to proceed quickly through the rest of the Bill so that it can receive further consideration on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was remiss of me, Mr. Mills, when I caught your eye earlier in the debate, and was, quite properly rebuked by you, not to congratulate the promoter of the Bill on securing his place in the ballot and to wish him success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share with the hon. Member for Makerfield a degree of uncertainty about what we are doing with the amendments. I understood my hon. Friend the Minister to say that amendment No. 6 was probing but the other two were not. However, he may wish to correct me on that. If I am correct, we will then be in the unusual position of having the Bill's promoter seemingly willing to accept the probing amendment. It may therefore be necessary for other members of the Committee to persuade the promoter to resist the probing amendment. As the hon. Member for Makerfield said, it would be ridiculous to include it in the Bill when it was simply intended to be helpful. I can see that my hon. Friend is now interested enough to join in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My interest has not flagged for a moment this morning, Mr. Mills. I am especially stimulated by my non. Friend the Member for Swindon. It may have been slightly unfortunate to use the parliamentary idiom "probing". I accept the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
comments of the hon. Member for Makerfield that it is not the Government's lot to probe. It was amendment No. 7 that was intended to be probing, in an effort to find out what is meant by "reasonable steps".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. The provisions deal with what I hope is a minority of companies or organisations. The vast majority have in place procedures to deal with the kind of problems covered in the Bill. The management of such organisations wish to hear the concerns, complaints and criticisms of employees and deal with them in the proper way. Therefore, the Bill obviously has to address the minority of companies or organisations in which no such procedures are in force and such wrongdoing as has been described might take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that context, we should try to avoid producing legislation that penalises well-run and efficient organisations simply because they might contain a few people who, for whatever reason, seek to make trouble. We should put in place a framework under which the problems that occur in the minority of organisations will be dealt with quickly and effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two questions for my hon. Friend the Minister on which I, and perhaps other members of the Committee, would like clarification. Why does amendment No. 7 specify a period of two months? As the hon. Member for Islwyn said, two months is a long time if there is continuing serious abuse. It might be reasonable to allow a sensible person to investigate a complaint properly for two months, but it could also cause confusion and problems. Why did my hon. Friend and his advisers light upon two months in drafting this probing amendment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, will my hon. Friend explain who would be the likely person to whom the obligation of confidentiality is owed? Is that clear in law? Would it be the company's managing director, the employee's immediate line manager or the personnel manager? Could it be any one of them? Would it therefore be necessary later in the Bill's passage to define more clearly who is meant by the person to whom the obligation of confidentiality is owed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said a moment ago that I thought that we would shortly discover whether the Minister was going to be genuinely helpful to the promoter and to the Bill or whether he had other purposes. This is the moment when we discover whether the Minister and his disciples are here to help or to subvert. I say that because I remember the starring role played by the hon. Member for Swindon in subverting the Right to Know Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My eyebrows are raised because of the hon. Gentleman's use of the plural in referring to disciples. Is he seeing double?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We may not yet have discovered exactly how many disciples there are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the moment of truth. The Minister has told us that he does not want legislation, and that that is his animating purpose, yet now he wants to produce a measure that is more complex than the Bill as drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the reasons why the Bill has attracted so much support throughout the House is that it is wonderfully simple. It does not require companies to erect vast new systems with intricate procedures about two month periods, exchanges of letters and field days for lawyers. It simply takes the existing law of confidence and looks at the aspects in which it is deficient—that is not protecting those people who want to utilise it in the public interest—and completes that circle. The Bill, in all its simplicity, uses words such as "reasonable", as has just been referred to, which are judges' words—exactly those that the law of confidence uses to decide whether that law should be upheld in particular cases. It applies tests of reasonableness and that language and those tests have been transferred simply and straightforwardly from the existing law of confidence into this measure of protection. Instead of welcoming the Bill's simplicity and the resulting absence of the imposition of any burdens, the Minister, in a schizophrenic spirit of wanting to be helpful but not wanting to legislate, produces cumbersome procedures that will be burdensome to businesses, which none of us wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the consensus in Committee is that the Bill will not be much used if public and private organisations produce good, internal systems of their own, so that good things happen through culture; they will not need the law in order to happen. I therefore ask the Minister to respond to my question, which I may have asked on Second Reading. Does he want organisations to develop good internal systems tailored to their needs to solve the problems that the Bill tackles, despite the fact that auditors and other professional bodies have been withdrawn from the scope of the Bill? If so, is not the way to do it to close the legislative circle so that every organisation knows that it must develop such systems or there might be consequences of the kind that the Bill will tackle?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are in a dilemma in deciding whether their mission is to subvert the Bill or to help it. If their mission is to help it, they will not do so by creating new burdens and complexities where there is simplicity based on existing law. As a seditious footnote, in case the hon. Member for Swindon asks what is abuse of authority, I suggest, in the spirit of our proceedings, that an abuse of authority would be for a Minister, or a Minister's disciple, to try to subvert the will of Parliament as overwhelmingly expressed on the Second Reading of a Bill. If the Minister were to do that, in the spirit of the Bill people should know about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise utterly bewildered and undone by the hon. Gentlemen's intervention. I am reminded of Oscar Wilde entering the United States of America and being asked to fill in an immigration form which stated, "Is it your intention to subvert the lawful government of the united States of America?", to which he replied, "Sole purpose of visit." It is not my intention to subvert the Parliament whose servant I am in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
I have no disciples; the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) covered himself in glory by introducing the Activity Centres (Young Persons' Safety) Act 1995, for which we are all grateful and for which we applaud him. That will be a standing testimony to his service as a Member of Parliament, even if he achieves no such replica. The hon. Gentleman knows that I have no disciples. I have known him for possibly longer than he would want me to tell the Committee. We served together on a certain municipality many years ago. He was a young member of the Labour party and I was a young member of the Conservative party. We used to listen to boring debates conducted by aldermen on Solihull county borough council as it then was. Secretly, at the end of every council session the hon. Gentleman and I would award our plastic banana to the most boring intervention of the evening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the risk of saying it twice, I have no disciples. Unlike Bellman in "The Hunting of the Snark", I do not claim that anything that I say three times is true. I bring no theology, doctrine or, still less, dogma to these issues. In fact, to reassure the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Dr. Wright) of my good faith, and that I am the very antithesis of subversion, I make it clear that I shall not press amendments Nos. 7 and 8. That is partly for the reasons that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. We have offered a complicated model, but I do not want that. Therefore, I am prepared to reconsider the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about the significance of two months, and I owe it to my hon. Friend the Member for Swindon to answer that point. As I said earlier, we are seeking, wherever possible, to introduce elements of certainty. There is no certainty for employers or employees in the phrase "reasonable steps". Two months may be seen as an appropriate and reasonable time for an employer to investigate a matter thoroughly and to show that he is prepared to take it seriously, but the Government are not necessarily wedded to the detail in the amendment. My Hon. Friend the Member for Swindon also questioned me quite properly about the person to whom a confidential obligation lies, and we might look again at clarifying who that involves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are weaknesses in clause 2, and I shall stick with amendment No. 6 because I am not happy about the use of the word "principally" in clause 2(1)(c). However much I asked, I did not receive an answer on that point. In addition, I am not happy about the phrase "in bad faith" in clause 2(1)(a). The onus of proof of bad faith remains with the employer and that is stunningly difficult to prove.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 7 was designed to probe what was meant by "reasonable steps" in clause 2(1)(d). I made it clear that I was not particularly wedded to the precise wording of the amendment, but the problem is clear. The Bill gives no real sign of what an employee must do internally before going public with a disclosure. It is essential that everyone—employers, employees and tribunals—should have a clear understanding of what internal procedures are required before a disclosure is protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
I recognise that a balance must be struck between a proper internal procedure and delaying justified disclosure unnecessarily. I shall not, therefore, press amendments Nos. 7 and 8, but we must return to these issues on Report. I shall reflect on how best to do that. However, I shall press amendment No. 6</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>PROTECTION AGAINST REPRISALS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 9, in page 2, line 23, leave out from beginning to second 'or' in line 24. [	<i>Mr. John M. Taylor</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page 2, line 24, leave out from 'office' to end of line 26. The amendment deletes the provision that states no individual shall be guilty of an offence for making a protected disclosure. The main objective of the amendment is to ensure that the Bill does not create a "public interest" defence for disclosures in breach of statute including the Official Secrets Acts 1911 and 1989.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment is not made and subsection (1)(b) is not deleted, the effect of the Bill would be uncertain, but it could be held to create a public interest defence for someone accused of committing a criminal offence by disclosing information in breach of statute including, and in particular, of the Official Secrets Acts. That would run directly counter to Parliament's express intentions in passing those Acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important amendment. It is surely wrong in principle that a Bill that is essentially about civil breaches of confidence should stray into the area of the criminal law. Subsection (1)(b) could affect a number of enactments, but the most important are the Official Secrets Acts. Some hon. Members will recall the debates on the 1989 Act, which replaced the discredited section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911. The 1989 Act narrowed the scope of the law to define clearly a limited range of circumstances in which the unauthorised disclosure of official information is penalised. Under the 1989 Act, it is an offence to disclose official information only in six specified categories and only if the disclosure is damaging to the national interest. The six categories are first, security and intelligence; secondly, defence; thirdly, international relations; fourthly, foreign confidences; fifthly, information which might lead to the commission of crime; and, sixthly, the special investigation powers under the Interception of Communications Act 1985 and the Security Services Act 1989.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Act sets a different test or tests of damage for each of the six categories of information. For an offence to be committed under the Act, the disclosure must have damaged the national interest in a particular way. The Act is not concerned with embarrassing disclosures; it deals only with disclosures
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
that give rise to specific kinds of harm to the national interest. As the 1989 Official Secrets Act is clear and effective in penalising only those disclosures that cause a serious degree of harm to the national interest, it follows that there is no place for a public interest defence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am conscious that the Minister has a simple brief and I do not want to burden him any longer.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give way in a moment, but I must make my point. I have said twice that the recent House of Lords decision in the case of Pepper v. Hart—I refer to the judicial, not the legislative, House of Lords—means that the words used by a Minister during debate can be used in courts for a proper interpretation of what the legislation means. That makes it all the more important that I should not take any short cuts and should unburden myself as to the Government's position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister, as a representative of the Government, could help the Committee by classifying the rest of his speech as covered by the Official Secrets Act 1989. He should gag himself for a few moments and let us get on to the rest of the clauses. We could make good progress. He has made substantially in depth and scope the point why the amendment is necessary. Given that every member of the Committee agrees with that, we should get on to the issues dealt with by clause 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I am unmoved and intend to complete my remarks under this head of the Bill, because it is one of the most important. This is the last place that I should take a short cut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Official Secrets Act 1989 is clear and effective in penalising only those disclosures which cause a serious degree of harm to the national interest, it follows axiomatically that there is no place for a public interest defence. A person who knowingly harms the national interest should be criminally liable. The Government cannot see any circumstances in which that harm should be disregarded. Moreover, the result of providing a public interest defence, as subsection (1)(b) appears to do, would be that it would never be clear in what circumstances the unauthorised disclosure of official information would be an offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue was debated at length during the passage of the 1989 Act. The object of a public interest defence in the context of the 1989 Act would have been to enable the courts to consider the benefit of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0625">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
unauthorised disclosure of particular information and the motives of the person disclosing it, as well as the harm which it was likely to cause. It was suggested then that such a defence was necessary to enable suggestions of misconduct or malpractice to be properly investigated or brought to public attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government recognise that some people who make unauthorised disclosures do so for what they see as justified reasons. In the Government's view, there is no case for allowing the ultimate motives of the discloser to be a relevant factor in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two features of the 1989 Act particularly reinforce that conclusion. First, a central objective of the reform was to achieve maximum clarity in the law and in its application. A general public interest defence would make it impossible to achieve such clarity. Secondly, the protection of the criminal law is now concentrated on information which demonstrably requires its protection in the national interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It cannot be acceptable that a person could lawfully disclose information which he or she knows may, in the worst case, lead to a loss of life, simply because that person conceives that there is a general reason of a public character for doing so. The current law reflects the will of Parliament that there should be no public interest defence and that any argument as to the effect of disclosure should take place in the context of the damage tests where applicable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is therefore essential to ensure that the effectiveness of the 1989 Act is not undermined. It does not defeat the underlying purpose of the Bill, but simply ensures that its scope is properly confined to circumstances of a breach of the civil duties of confidence or contract where a public interest defence may legitimately be available.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to oppose the motion that clause 4 stand part of the bill, and my reasons for doing so are simple. As I explained earlier, the Government believe that if people who make public interest disclosures are to be protected, such protection should be solely in the context of employment. The Bill, of course, has a much wider ambit. Clause 3(1)(a) proposes protection in relation to
	<br><q><p>"any employment, profession, voluntary work, contract, membership of an organisation or the holding of any office".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Mills. I do not want to delay the Committee unduly, but the Minister referred to clause 3 and other issues, but the Committee has already agreed that clause 3 should stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are on the clause 4 stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, but the Minister continues to refer to clause 3, which the Committee has approved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the easiest way to explain the problem is to consider examples of cases that could arise if the Bill were enacted in its current form. Let us consider the case of a commercial contract between a company and a consultant or tradesman who discovers what he believes to be a malpractice while working for the company. For the sake of example, the consultant or tradesman considered that the company is not applying proper fire precautions. In accordance with clause 2, he raises the matter internally, but receives a response that he considers inadequate. He therefore complains to the local newspaper that company X has inadequate fire precautions. Let us further assume that a court would hold the disclosure to be in the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such adverse publicity is, of course, damaging for the company and it might in fact turn out that the claim is unfounded. Under the Bill, however it would be a protected disclosure, provided that the person believed on reasonable grounds that the information was accurate and met the other criteria in clause 2. The necessary relationship of trust between the company and the contractor is, however, bound to be destroyed by such a disclosure, whether or not it is true. It would be completely unreasonable to prevent the company from seeking to end or not to renew the contract. Moreover, that provision could lead to arguments when a contract is terminated or not renewed—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Mills. I listened carefully to the Minister. He has attempted to remove the phraseology of clause 3, but the issues that he is dealing with still relate solely to clause 3. They do not relate to clause 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chan-man</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might help the Committee if I point out that the Committee passed amendment No. 12, which leaves out clause 4 subsections (1) to (3). Therefore, it is in order to discuss only the remaining parts of clause 4—subsections (4) and (5).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, consequentially, I am doing so. In the sort of instance that I have cited there is a danger that a contractor who fears losing a contract may seek a pretext for a public disclosure to try to prevent the company from ending the contract. The provision will cause many more difficulties than it solves—if, indeed, it addresses a real problem. The Government are not aware of significant evidence that there is a problem that needs to be addressed. The people, other than employees, who are most likely to discover a matter needing to be disclosed, notably members of the professions, already have sufficient protection or are prevented by their own rules from making such disclosures, as is the case for legal advisers.

	<div class='title'>BURDEN OF PROOF IN RELATION TO CONFIDENTIALITY</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With clause 6 we are moving away from the essence of the Bill. The clause provides that if a public body claims that it is owed an obligation of confidence, it is for that body to prove that it is in the public interest for that information to remain confidential. That goes further than the real subject matter of the Bill because it relates to any action, not only to actions arising under the Bill.

The clause deals with one particular aspect of the law of breach of confidence that, at present, is based on common law, not statute. I accept that there may be a case for putting it on a statutory basis, but that should be done properly. It is neither desirable nor necessary to put this one aspect of the general law of breach of confidence into legislation. In attempting to deal with that aspect, the clause goes much too wide. It provides that if a public body claims to be owed an obligation of confidence other than under a contract or by virtue of legislation, it is for that public body to establish that the obligation of confidence exists and that it is in the public interest for the information in question not to be disclosed. In my view it is unnecessary to state the common law position in legislation. There is always a risk that in attempting to do so, mistakes will be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is not limited to the circumstances in which the common law described applies. It extends to cases in which obligation of confidence is owed to the public body under a contract or under legislation. For reasons that I shall come to, I think that that is clearly wrong. It follows that even if clause 6 were limited to the circumstances dealt with in the rest of the Bill, it would not be justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point or order, Mr. Mills. I seek clarification for the Committee. During the early part of our proceedings it was suggested that we might need a sittings motion. Even with the best will in the world, the Minister will see us through to one o'clock and we will not finish our discussions on the Bill. I seek your advice, Mr. Mills, on whether we need a formal sittings motion, or will you ensure that the Committee meets again to deal with the clauses that will not have been debated by one o'clock?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a sittings motion is moved, I shall deal with it shortly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that you, Mr. Mills, would not want me to comment further on that point of order. I am sure that the Committee rests content that you supervise such matters ably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is wrong with clause 6, among other things, is that it is a reversal of the burden of proof for public bodies. The clause is drafted in terms of proving that it is in the public interest that information should be confidential. However, in the structure of the Bill, the clause comes into play only when a disclosure has been made and the person seeks a declaration or remedy. In practice, the effect of the clause would be that when someone disclosed information obtained in confidence from a public body, the burden would be on that body to prove that it was in the public interest for the information to be kept confidential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is unfair and unjustifiably discriminates against public bodies. When a private sector body is involved, the person who has made a disclosure must show that it was justified in the public interest. In the case of a public body, the primary requirement—the first provision in clause 1—is reversed and it is for the body to prove that the public interest is in the information being confidential. Moreover, singling
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
out public bodies for such unfavourable treatment runs counter to the general principle in clause 1 that the Bill should rely on existing common law that relates to the disclosure of confidential information in the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government can see no reason for treating public and private bodies in identical circumstances in diametrically opposed ways. It must be for the person who breaches a confidence, contrary to the obligation that he owes under his contract of employment or legislation, to show that there are genuine and adequate grounds for that breach. That is where the burden of proof must lie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said earlier that I was prepared to accept amendment No. 17 in order to clear the matter up before the Committee rises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have addressed this problem in three different contexts this morning. It is right that I should be able, on behalf of the Government, to enter into the record our views on various aspects of the Bill. I say that because—at the risk of repeating myself—I am particularly seized of the modern relevance of the House of Lords decision in Pepper v. Hart. That means that in any subsequent dispute about the text of a piece of legislation, the words that were used by the Minister during the various stages of the Bill may be claimed in aid of the litigants. As I may be hostage to that very fortune at some future stage, I am slavishly sticking to my script, and it is my right to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may ask members of the Committee to consider for a moment the case of someone such as a police officer or civil servant who discloses information purporting to show misconduct—I reiterate that that is a dangerously wide term—about a figure in public life. The disclosure might be that that figure is being investigated for tax reasons, or has allegedly committed some other misconduct. By virtue of clause 6, it would be for the public body employer of the person who has made the disclosure to prove that it was in the public interest that the information should be confidential. The real damage, however, would be suffered not by the public body, but by the figure about whom the information was disclosed. That is not something that the public body should have to prove.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More generally, people who work in public bodies routinely and constantly have access to information that would undoubtedly be of interest to certain newspapers and sections of the public, but it is obviously not in the public interest that such information should be disclosed; nor should the bodies concerned have to prove on each occasion why disclosure is not in the public interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is a lawyer and has given the example of a police authority. Is it not currently the case that when a comment, inappropriate or otherwise, in a written report or an investigation gets into the public domain and is damaging to an individual, it is the responsibility of the appropriate police authority to provide a remedy for that? That is the current position. The hon. Gentleman has set up a false dichotomy and thus has a false case that he can knock down. The authority currently has

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
responsibility—and has always had responsibility—for the actions of its employees during their work on its behalf.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure how far I should allow myself to be drawn into discussions on other legislation that concerns the conduct and proper order of police authorities. The hon. Gentleman typecasts me as a lawyer, but I should like to step away from that. I am here, like every other member of the Committee, having been elected on a popular franchise to try to serve in this Parliament and to make the law in England and Wales as good as possible. I have not practised the law for eight years and do not hold a practising certificate. There is nothing as useless as an out-of-date lawyer, so I shall try to be an up-to-date politician instead.

Clause 6 is one of the simplest and most straightforward clauses in the Bill, but it is simply and straightforwardly wrong. It gives rise to a different burden of proof for public bodies as against private bodies. That is gratuitous discrimination, which should not be sustained. There is a real danger that clause 6 would encourage a lowering of standards in the public service. At worst, it may lead to the compromising of national security or of highly sensitive information because of an individual's mistaken belief that the disclosure was in the public interest. Public bodies should not be exposed to that risk. Many of their staff owe a particular duty of confidence because of the nature of their work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
