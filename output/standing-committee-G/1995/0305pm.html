	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 336, in page 45, leave out lines 21 to 30 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) In subsection (1) after 'may' insert 'at any time during the original tenancy or any replacement tenancy until such time as the landlord serves a notice under section 13(2)'</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(3) In sub-section (4)(a) after 'application' insert 'and, provided there is no change of circumstances, the determined rent shall remain for such period between one and two years as the rent assessment committee shall direct, regardless of any change of tenant or landlord.'.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment is designed to allow tenants more flexibility when referring their levels of rent to the rent assessment committee. It would fix the determined rent at the maximum payable for a minimum period of one year and for a maximum period of two years, whether or not there is a change in tenancy during that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasons behind the amendment are simple. The Department of the Environment's statistics show a considerable increase in the number of referrals to the rent assessment committee for determination of assured shorthold rents. For example, 166 referrals were made in 1989 and, in 1995, that number rose to 1,520. One reason for the rise is that local authorities are now more likely to encourage tenants to make referrals to the rent assessment committee when they are informed of a rent restriction on their housing benefit assessment. That is good practice and I image that all members of the Committee would want to encourage councils to continue it. It gives tenants on low income the opportunity to narrow the gap between their housing benefit and their rents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another reason behind the amendment might encourage the Under-Secretary of State to support it. It would save an enormous amount of money that is paid out in housing benefit. Let us consider the Department of the Environment's estimate showing that 300,000 shorthold tenancies are claiming housing benefit. About 40 per cent. of them have their rent restricted and the average rent restriction for housing benefit is about £900 a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If only half of the rent-restricted claimants applied to rent assessment committees and the rent was reduced by the average amount, the savings in housing benefit would be about £20 million. I am sure that the Under-Secretary's colleagues in the Treasury would be more than delighted if such a saving could
	<span class='label label-info column'>490</span>
be made. It would mean that tenants would not have to fill in the gap of £900 that should be used for food and other essentials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, tenants have the right to make referrals within six months of the tenancies, but they do not necessarily need to make such referrals within those first six months. They may be in work or they might not be particularly concerned about the level of rents. They may not realise that their rents are substantially more than other rents in the area. In some areas, market rents go up and down over time. Therefore, a rent that was only a little in excess of similar market rents might rise significantly. Alternatively, tenants may have moved to an area that was not particularly well known to them and it may take them some time to realise that rent levels in the locality were considerably lower than their rents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is obvious that, if there were fewer lettings of tenancies for rents that were significantly higher than market levels, fewer tenants would have rent arrears because of housing benefit restrictions or a change in financial circumstances. That in turn, would reduce the number of possession actions on rent arrears, which is an important factor if the mandatory grounds are widened as proposed in clause 78.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite all the rule changes for the assessment of housing benefit and the role of the rent officer in that process, in the vast majority of cases there is no scope for the quality of individual lettings to be taken into account. Therefore, poor quality, substandard, even dangerous accommodation sometimes attracts a better rent than it deserves and there is no incentive for landlords to bring their properties up to an acceptable standard. However, rent assessment committees can invite detailed submissions from both landlords and tenants about the merits of the property and can carry out inspections before determining the rent. Landlords would be penalised for providing substandard lettings and good landlords, who run well-managed homes would see that reflected in the level of the rent. It would encourage landlords to carry out proper repairs and improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Encouraging the wider use of the rent assessment committee would be a strong disincentive for landlords who are tempted to get rid of tenants whose rents have been determined by the committee in order to re-let the property at the previous excessive rent. That is why we believe that giving the maximum rent payable for a fixed period of between one and two years, even if the tenant changes, would be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a reasonable amendment that would help the tenant who may not initially have a view about the level of the rent, or who may after six months find that his finances have changed quite markedly. It would also help good landlords who have decent properties to charge a proper rent and would encourage rogue landlords to improve their properties. If we can achieve that, we would save the Treasury a considerable amount of money whch could be better spent elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. James Clappison)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0281">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>491</span>
Member for Lewisham, East (Mrs. Prentice) moved the amendment in an attractive way and was clearly anxious to strike a reasonable note. Notwithstanding that, the Committee should beware of the amendment because it would extend the scope of regulations on assured shorthold tenancies beyond what we propose in the Bill and, indeed, beyond what was established by the Housing Act 1988, when we were anxious to strike a balance and to keep the scope of regulation at a level that would encourage landlords to let their properties and increase the supply of rented property on the market. The Committee knows that that has been a success and that the balance that was struck in 1988 has secured those objectives. I know that there are some ardent deregulationists in the Committee who should note that the amendment would be re-regulationary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the detail of the amendment, the best way in which to view the six-month period over which tenants are entitled to refer their rent to the rent assessment committee is to regard that period as an initial safeguard for tenants. Shorthold tenants were given the right in 1988 to refer to the rent assessment committee, thereby providing a safeguard against unreasonably high rents as shorthold tenancies and market rents were introduced. As the Committee is probably aware, in the housing White Paper, we proposed to remove that right on the ground that it was little used. I listened with interest to the figures mentioned by the hon. Member for Lewisham, East. I do not know the exact figures but I imagine that she would agree that since 1988 there has been a substantial increase in the number of assured shorthold tenancies. We should set the increase in referrals to which the hon. Lady referred against that background. Even now, 1,500 referrals is a small proportion of assured tenancies, of which there are about 800,000. However, in the light of responses to the White Paper, we decided to maintain the shorthold tenants' right of referral during the first six months of the original tenancy. We believe that six months provides a reasonable opportunity for the tenant to make an application, while giving the landlord the certainty that an appeal cannot be made after the deadline has passed. We would not advise going beyond that initial safeguard of six months by extending to a replacement tenancy the right of referral to a rent assessment committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the new subsection (3), which is proposed in amendment No. 336. I cannot accept that the rent assessment committee should be able to set a rent for more than a year ahead. That would clearly be additional regulation. I suggest that the landlord should be certain that he can increase the rent in line with market movements; nor is it reasonable to expect the committee to predict movements in the rental market over a longer period, as envisaged in the amendment. The tenant will, of course, have the opportunity to negotiate with the landlord the rent for a replacement tenancy. Both landlord and tenant will be able to take account of any determination made by the committee during the original tenancy. If the
	<span class='label label-info column'>492</span>
original tenancy lapses into a statutory periodic tenancy, the tenant will have another opportunity to apply to the Committee for a determination if the landlord serves a notice of rent increase under section 13 of the Housing Act 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The safeguards already in place are adequate. To go any further, as the amendment envisages, would establish further regulation. That would be undesirable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Undersecretary began by saying that my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East (Mrs. Prentice) had been most reasonable in moving the amendment. He is absolutely right. When my hon. Friends are reasonable, they hope to get a reasonable response from Ministers. If the Government cannot be more accommodating when such helpful amendments are moved, we might have to think about being more unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once again, the Under-Secretary disappoints us. I am not sure whether that is because the Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration is not present and he is not allowed to make concessions by himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remember being chastised not so long ago for making too many concessions to the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, something happened to the Minister over the weekend, and it was not for the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard from the Under-Secretary the old argument; whenever we make a helpful suggestion that might safeguard tenants, he uses that well-worn phrase, "It would be another regulation." To curry favour with some of his slightly less thinking colleagues, the Minister said that they were deregulators. It is a pity that the Government elevate a mechanism for delivering policy to a political philosophy, which is what they have done with the matter of regulation and deregulation. The idea that deregulation is a political philosophy is a load of nonsense. Regulations put into practice policies that should themselves combine into an overall philosophy, but the Government seem to have lost sight of that completely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is ironic that the Minister is attacking the Opposition for wanting to regulate when we are trying to amend the Government's own attempts at regulation. We are debating a clause that tries to put a further restriction on the opportunity of tenants to have their rents assessed. The clause is a further attempt to regulate tenants and restrict their ability to have their rents assessed by the appropriate committee. We moved the amendment because we believe that to be wrong. We believe that tenants should have the additional freedom suggested in the amendment. We believe that the restriction of six months in clause 77, itself an amendment to the Housing Act 1988, is wrong. It is too restrictive and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0282">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>493</span>
shifts the balance towards the landlord and against the interests of tenants. The Government constantly do that in the Bill. They seek to protect one particular interest and to ignore the interest of another party—that of the tenant, who in most cases, is far more vulnerable and in need of protection. The tenant is to be denied the right that he previously had under certain circumstances to have his rent assessed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary did not explain why the clause is necessary. What is the current problem that causes the Government to introduce new legislation? If the Under-Secretary criticises our amendment, he should explain the Government's intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the second part of the amendment, why should not the rent assessment committee set the rent for one to two years? The Under-Secretary underestimates the extent to which tenants, who do not have the resources and expert advice that are available to landlords, find the process trying and traumatic. The less often we put them through it, the better. The committee should be allowed to determine the rent level for a slightly longer period—up to two years. The tenancy would be subject to the process less often, which would give it greater stability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that the Under-Secretary accepts that the rent assessment committee has the right to fix a rent for one to two years. If that right exists and the committee comes to a view that two years is an inappropriate period, it can adjust the rent accordingly. There is no question of the landlord getting a worse deal because the rent is set for a longer period. The rent can be set for a longer period and the rent level can reflect that, but the process would occur less often.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are supposed to be committed to less bureaucracy and less waste because of bureaucracy. If a tenancy has to be submitted less often to the rent assessment committee, that would seem to be admirable common sense and a change that the Government should welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed by the Under-Secretary's response. He said mat only a small proportion of tenancies are now referred, but that may be just the tip of the iceberg. Many more people may be in similar circumstances, and further savings could be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) made some telling points about the need to protect tenants. It is difficult for tenants to go to the rent assessment committee, because they often feel under threat from the landlord for raising the matter. If our proposal was enshrined in the Bill, it would give them a greater feeling of security. However, if the Under-Secretary is not minded to be as generous as he tells us that he has been in the past, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>MANDATORY POSSESSION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT: REDUCTION IN ARREARS REQUIRED</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Diana Maddock 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 332, in page 45, line 33, leave out from "possession" to end of line 37 and insert "leave out Ground 8".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill proposes to reduce the mandatory ground for possession for assured tenants from three months to two months. Many believe that that will cause untold hardship for many private tenants, and that there are good reasons for removing the mandatory element entirely, which is the aim of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike the case of owner-occupiers and council tenants, under ground 8 the court has no discretion if it discovers that the tenant is at a certain level of arrears. Under the Housing Act 1988 the discretionary ground 10 allows the court to grant possession if it considers that appropriate. Given the fact that there are proposals to change housing benefit regulations so that housing benefit will be paid four weeks in arrears, there is even more cause for concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Under-Secretary to say why he thinks private tenants should be treated differently from home owners or council tenants. In the case of mortgage lenders, the courts have discretion to make suggestions about payment orders to deal with arrears and to defer, suspend or even refuse possession. In such cases, judges are allowed to take into account the circumstances of both the borrower and the lender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If councils want to evict tenants, they must go through numerous hoops before they can do so. Even housing associations, by virtue of their tenants' guarantee, do not use ground 8 to evict tenants in arrears; they use discretionary ground 10. The Government view private sector lets as a business; they are a business, but we must remember that people live in such properties—they are their homes. That is why this matter must be considered carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If ground 8 were removed from the Housing Act 1988, landlords could still use the discretionary ground. Frequently, it is probably more in their interest to use the discretionary ground because the court can arrange for the repayment of arrears. Landlords are far more likely to be paid arrears if the tenant is still living in their properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rent arrears occur for many different reasons, but they are often caused by benefit delays, benefit restrictions and, in some cases, poverty. Because ground 8 is mandatory, the courts cannot take into account extenuating circumstances, such as ill health, ability to pay and whether a tenant has children or other dependants. There is an anomaly: the Government continue to cut housing benefit in the private sector even though private sector rents are increasing, yet they want to make it easier for landlords to evict tenants in rent arrears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0283">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>495</span>
In many areas, tenants face long delays in housing benefit. It has been estimated that 70 per cent. of authorities manage to pay only 80 per cent. of housing benefit claims within 14 days. Often the areas with the most delays are those where there is most pressure on housing benefit departments and where most people live in private sector accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposals to pay housing benefit in arrears will put people under increased pressure. If ground 8 were to be deleted, rent arrears would remain a discretionary ground under ground 10, which would mean that the circumstances to which I have referred could be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example of the sort of difficulties that can arise, especially when councils are investigating fraud. Mr. X claimed benefit on the bedsit into which he had just moved. He then received a letter saying that his claim for benefit was being suspended because a possible case of fraud was being investigated. Mr. X's landlord was receiving benefit direct from the council, but failed to inform the council that a tenant had moved away. Mr. X was without benefit for eight months, and his landlord evicted him, citing the mandatory ground of being more than 13 weeks in arrears. If the discretionary ground had been used and the full circumstances had come out in court, the court could have judged that the landlord should not have been granted mandatory possession because Mr. X would have eventually received benefit to pay the arrears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tenants face another problem. If landlords want to get tenants out, they fail to collect rent and, sometimes, even refuse to take rent. Landlords use such methods to gain possession. If the power was discretionary, not mandatory, such matters could be sorted out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Under-Secretary will consider the matter; there is plenty of evidence that ground 8 is unnecessary and unfair. It is high time that we treated private tenants in the same way as owner-occupiers and social sector housing tenants. Often, private tenants pay the highest rents for properties in the worst conditions—that is not always true, but sometimes it is. It would be much better if individual circumstances were taken into account by judges in the courts when deciding whether repossession should be granted on the ground of rent not having been paid. There are cases of genuine hardship, benefit delays and many other good reasons for rent not having been paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want a thriving .private rented sector, and the measure would give security to many people who live in such properties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the arguments advanced by the hon. Lady. She should be aware that the deletion of ground 8 proposed in the amendment would—this would also have been the effect of the previous amendment—substantially change the balance of safeguards and regulations established in the Housing Act 1988. I did not doubt
	<span class='label label-info column'>496</span>
her sincerity when she said that she wanted a thriving rented sector. The fact of which she—and others who want to impose additional regulations on the private rented sector—should be aware is that the Act has been a success and has helped the private rented sector to thrive. There is good reason why that is so: the whole thrust of our deregulation of the private rented sector has been to encourage more people to let their properties. The Housing Act 1988 has given landlords who may have only a small number of properties confidence that they will receive a reasonable market rent and be able to recover possession of their property when they need to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Removing ground 8—mandatory possession for arrears—would severely damage that confidence. Ground 8 is the only mandatory ground for rent arrears. As the Committee will be aware, for many landlords, having a tenant who does not pay the rent can be difficult, especially if there is a loan to repay. Where a tenant has accrued a specific amount of rent arrears, ground 8 gives the landlord certainty that he can get his property back.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There can be no justification for that. There is also the problem of local authorities having to pay housing benefit to tenants who do not pay their landlords. Will the Minister do anything about such cases?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be aware that there is an amendment in the name of his hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the Minister says, but the point is that we know that the circumstances of people entering the private rented sector and the fact that housing benefit is paid in arrears makes life difficult for a large number of tenants. Even if ground 8 were deleted, ground 10 allows landlords to obtain repossession for non-payment of rent. We are talking about vulnerable people who will, for reasons beyond their control, not be able to pay their rent. They have no recourse; there is no discretion; they can simply be thrown out. That does not happen in any other housing sector. I ask the Minister to address that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady's amendment would disturb the balance. Ground 8 gives a landlord the confidence that he will be able to regain his property should rent be unpaid for a long period. Ground 10 is discretionary and applies only when some rent is lawfully due from the tenant. We believe
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0284">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>497</span>
that landlords need the confidence given by ground 8. It has existed since 1988 and it has been a success in giving landlords the confidence that they seek to bring properties on to the market for letting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Burden 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Northfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Under-Secretary saying that landlords need the confidence that they will automatically regain possession even if they do not have a substantial argument for that? That is the effect of ground 8.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is possibly underestimating the importance to landlords of rent arrears. Rent arrears for substantial periods are a serious matter for landlords. We judge that a landlord who is owed substantial rent arrears and who may, because of that, face hardship himself should be entitled to regain his property as of right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely what would be considered by a court. It would examine the arguments and the merits of a case. Landlords facing the difficulties that the Under-Secretary described would have a good chance of succeeding in court.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be unkind to the hon. Gentleman, but I think that he is totally misunderstanding the difference between ground 8 and ground 10. Ground 8 means that a tenant who has been in arrears for a substantial period creates a ground on which a landlord is entitled to mandatory possession. Ground 10, under which there is discretion for a court, covers a different situation when some arrears exist, but they are less than the amount required for mandatory posession. I remind the hon. Gentleman that that has been the case since 1988. The change envisaged by the amendment would be a severe and damaging blow to the confidence of landlords in the private rented sector and it would reduce the number of lettings being made available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cirencester and Tewkesbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary. Does he agree that rent arrears are not the only factor in such cases? When a tenant does not pay any rent, damage to the property is also likely. Therefore, a landlord wants to be assured that he can get a bad tenant out fairly quickly so that he can minimise the damage to the property. The cost of such damage is likely to be far greater than the amount owing in rent arrears.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an extremely good point. I cannot think of a better point on which to conclude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has said much about security for landlords, but the amendment is about security for tenants and letting them know where they stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to differ with the Under-Secretary about the use of ground 10. The fact that tenants may be evicted because, through no fault of their own, they cannot
	<span class='label label-info column'>498</span>
afford to pay the rent and without the circumstances being taken into account is extremely unfair. Those people may be especially vulnerable and they may not have the right to be housed in permanent accommodation when they are made homeless. The Government's provision is a recipe for disaster for many families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, I asked what would happen to a family, with children in a local school, who try to get housing benefit from a local authority, do not get it and, therefore, find themselves out on the streets. This morning, the Minister did not deal with the problems of such families and he has not referred to them this afternoon, either. I am concerned because people have no discretion over the use of ground 8 and because the Minister said that it has worked well for the past few years. However, the position will change in the private rented sector and more people will use it. More people may get into difficulties and that means that more people will be vulnerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary is happy for housing benefit to be paid in arrears, but he does not foresee the problems that people will face. Even more people could end up on the streets, and that would be a shame. Yesterday, the Government took their rough sleepers initiative a step forward, but today they will take a step back. I shall push the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 342, in page 45, line 37, at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>"and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(c) at the end of Ground 8 insert—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'For the purposes of this ground, any amount of unpaid housing benefit to which the tenant is lawfully entitled shall be regarded as if it were rent paid by the tenant.'.".</p></blockquote>
Much as it grieved us not to be able to support the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock), I hope that, with this amendment, we can achieve some agreement in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to require the court to set aside for the purposes of ground 8—which we have discussed a considerable amount in the past few minutes—any arrears that result from official error, including delays in the processing of housing benefit claims. I cannot believe that there is a member
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0285">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>499</span>
of the Committee who has not been approached by many constitutents about delays in the processing of housing benefit claims, whether by the local authority or the Benefits Agency. The amendment is designed to protect the tenant from such delays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have already heard, ground 8 is a mandatory ground. Once its conditions are met, the court has no choice but to grant possession. That means that possession will be granted even if the reason for the arrears is the failure of the local authority or the Benefits Agency to process the claim within the 14 days required by the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we have seen a number of improvements in the Benefits Agency and local authority systems, there are still many cases in which claims are not processed within 14 days. That can occur under the existing law, but under the Bill it will happen even more often, as the hon. Member for Christchurch said. The payment of housing benefit in arrears, which is to begin in October 1996, and the reduction of the arrears period after which landlords can start taking action from 13 weeks to eight, which is necessary for ground 8, will mean that in October this year there will be two more effects on tenants. They will cause difficulties for tenants, who will need protection against the possibility of eviction through no fault of their own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will not say that the tenant's remedy is to enforce the obligations on the local authority or the Benefits Agency under the regulations. That might be the case, but it is extremely difficult for tenants to do that while, at the same time, landlords are hammering on the door and calling for rent which tenants do not have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also hope that the Minister will not argue that the authority or the agency will be less concerned to eliminate delay if it knows that there is no risk of eviction. I should hope that we will be encouraging both organisations to progress claims speedily and efficiently, because that is for the benefit of tenants and, indeed, the authority and the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no apology for using a couple of examples from my constituency case work, but hasten to add that the cases I cite are rather old. Lewisham council has made a marked improvement in the processing of private sector housing benefit claims. However, some people have had traumatic experiences while waiting for claims to be processed. I am sure that other members of the Committee could cite examples from the Benefit Agency; in the past, its representatives have been hauled before Select Committees because of its inability to process claims quickly and efficiently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of my constituents was waiting for his housing benefit claim to be processed by the authority and, in the end, was thrown out by his landlord for nonpayment of rent. The landlord kept his possessions and deposit against the arrears. Although my constituent had claimed housing benefit at the property, he had received nothing. The arrears on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>500</span>
tenancy had been paid by the council to the landlord, but he was never notified of that and was still owed his deposit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that case, we managed eventually to get the matter sorted out, but the tenant suffered not only the loss of his deposit but, for a considerable time, the loss of his possessions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another example concerns a mature student who was living in a flat rented from the university at which she was studying. When the academic year ended and she was about to sign on, the process became too complicated for the Benefits Agency and the local authority to deal with. For three months or more, she did not receive housing benefit. Eventually, the university threatened to evict her. Had she been evicted from that property, she would have been unable to continue her studies. Her relationship had broken up and she had a young child; she was trying to get a secure life for herself and her child, but at the end of two academic years, the same situation arose. It was extremely difficult for her to carry on her studies under threat of eviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further example, which perhaps is unusual, concerns a young man who was an actor and who, therefore, worked only periodically. Every time he went to sign on, the process became gummed up in the works. He, too, was continually pressed by his landlord for rent which he was waiting to obtain through his claim for housing benefit. Indeed, his bank froze his account, threatened him with court action and stopped paying cheques to the landlord. Again, it was only by continual harassment, so to speak, of the local authority that the matter was sorted out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A final example concerns people with disabilities. Such cases seem particularly likely to occur when people are making several claims. Claiming any combination of housing benefit, disability living allowance or unemployment benefit seems to cause bureaucracy considerable difficulty in efficient processing. In this case, a young woman became deeply distressed. Not only was she disabled, but she had to go back and forwards to hospital for psychological help and support, and the threat of homelessness brought her close to a nervous breakdown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment does not go as far as that in the name of the hon. Member for Christchurch. It would, however, ensure that when the tenant is not at fault and has provided all the forms and information required to whichever authority is processing the claim, the tenant should not be held liable for the incompetence and inefficiency of the agency and the authority if they are taking their time processing the claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the amendment, we do not blame landlords for that. As the Minister has said, of course landlords have a right to receive their rent. We cannot expect them to be angels and say to their tenants, "Don't worry, it will probably come eventually." The natural reaction of the landlord is to remind the tenant frequently about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0286">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>501</span>
paying the rent. The more that that happens, the more traumatic and stressful the situation is for the tenant. Eventually, the landlord may say, "Enough is enough—you must go." That is not because the tenant has been a bad tenant, or has not been willing to pay the rent, but because of delays that occur in outside agencies that are beyond the tenant's control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to consider the amendment very seriously. Can he give us an assurance that local authorities and the Benefits Agency will work as efficiently as we would wish, and that tenants will not be punished for the misdemeanours of others?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that on this occasion, given the very reasonable way in which my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East has moved the amendment, the Minister will also be reasonable. This is a matter of great importance to tenants who are in the situation that has been described. They could suffer real hardship unless the amendment is accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of linked issues with regard to the ground for possession—its mandatory nature, the period of time that should be applied before the mandatory ground for possession comes into operation and whether there should be any restrictions or conditions on the way in which it operates. We are trying to strike a balance. We accept that there must be a balance—no one would argue that the law should be completely on the side of the tenant and never operate in favour of the landlord. There are occasions when tenants do not fulfil their part of the bargain—they deliberately seek to gain the benefit of the house in which they live, but pay no rent for it. That is why we accept that a balance must be struck.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in a number of provisions—this is the worst one in this part of the Bill—the balance is seriously wrong. It is almost as though the Government are tilting the balance 99 per cent. in favour of the landlord and 1 per cent. in favour of the tenant—on a good day, if the tenant is lucky. They are advancing a proposal that, in its original and unconditioned form, would tilt the balance so much that landlords would exploit it in some circumstances. Tenants who had done no wrong, and tried to do none, would be punished by a change in the law that could operate arbitrarily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that the ground for possession that is proposed is mandatory makes getting it right very important. I must tease the Under-Secretary a little by pointing out that I rather enjoyed listening to his justification, a few minutes ago, of the mandatory ground for possession. That could not have been the same Under-Secretary, could it, who the other day, during our debate on clause 115, responded to our arguments in favour of a mandatory power of arrest attached to an injunction by saying that we should give the courts discretion? That was the Under-Secretary's line the other day, when he berated many Opposition Members for arguing that in some cases a mandatory application would be appropriate. Now he argues for a change in the terms of a certain ground for possession, and is strongly in favour of making it mandatory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>502</span>
We did not vote for the earlier amendment because we have some sympathy with the approach in the clause, in certain circumstances. A tenant who deliberately did not pay rent for a period would have very little defence to an application, or ground to remain in the property. We can accept that as a logical proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are consistent in our arguments. In debating the mandatory power of arrest under clause 115, we also strongly specified that conditions would need to apply before such a mandatory power would be applicable, because the courts would not have discretion. That is the reason for our amendment. It is proposed to strengthen even further a mandatory ground for possession—non-payment of rent—and we do not believe that it is right to proceed on that ground, with no discretion allowed to the courts, if rent arrears have arisen simply because housing benefit to which the tenants are entitled has not been paid to them or their landlord. That is wrong. If the Minister believes that it is right he should justify it, by confirming that he would be happy for a tenant in his constituency to face eviction and the prospect of being thrown out on the streets because, through someone else's fault rent had not been paid. It need not even be someone else's fault. As my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East mentioned, often such delays are not anyone's fault, but simply the result of the complications of the benefit system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the Minister understands the matter or has been to talk to the staff of the housing benefit offices in his constituency. The people who deal with housing benefit claims can find a thousand and one reasons for applications taking a long time to process, through no fault of their own. Applications relating to the private rented sector always take longer. I challenge the Minister to examine the performance indicators of any local authority in the country, regardless of the political control, and not just for this year, but for past years. He would find in every case that applications for assessment of benefit levels applied to rents in private sector always take substantially longer on average than similar applications in the housing association or local authority sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A ceiling on benefits has now come into effect—another item of legislation of which local authorities must take account. That is another calculation process to be undergone—another piece of evidence to be gathered and kept by the authority. It is more information to be collected. That all lengthens the process of deciding applications. It does not mean that local authorities are inefficient. It means only that a longer process must be gone through, and, sometimes, that information is not available to enable necessary calculations of benefit to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On occasion I have asked local authorities about complaints that have been made about benefits not being paid. Sometimes, that is down to the inefficiency of council departments or because of an excessive work load. Delays can be caused because information is not forthcoming from the DSS, for example, as a result of which local authorities must wait for it before they can calculate benefits. Should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0287">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>503</span>
tenants be put at risk in such circumstances? I accept the problem that landlords are not getting their rent, but that is not the tenants' fault. It is not right to deal with the problem by using a mandatory ground for possession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to draw the Under-Secretary's attention to the situation in which landlords are the parties responsible for not giving the information that the authority needs to calculate housing benefit. The landlord is sometimes slack in coming forward with information, even though he may be depending on it for the benefit calculation to pay his rent. There may be good reasons why the landlord wanted vacant possession of his property, but he could have an interest in deliberately not passing on the necessary information needed to calculate housing benefit, in the knowledge that the tenant could not pay the rent. Under the clause, the tenant could be thrown out of the property within eight weeks on mandatory grounds with no come back. That the Bill allows the landlord to manipulate the situation cannot be right, can it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Minister's attention to another matter. The other day I was speaking to a senior housing officer from Brent council. The council has a rule that applies to landlords who are under serious investigation. Because of the possibility that a landlord may have defrauded the authority by making false benefit claims on his properties, Brent council freezes the payments of benefits on all the landlord's properties while the investigation takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A wonderful situation could be constructed under the Bill. Let us suppose a landlord is under investigation for potential fraud, as a result of which a Conservative-controlled council freezes the payment of benefits on that landlord's properties because there may be a wider case of fraud. In the process, the landlord's tenants may not pay the rent because their benefit is frozen. However, the fraud investigation could take more than eight weeks and the landlord, who is under investigation for fraud, still has the ground for mandatory possession of the properties. Does the Under-Secretary wish to defend such a position? It is neither right nor reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have grave reservations about substituting the period of 13 weeks with a period of eight weeks. Again, it is a matter of balance. There will not always be circumstances in which the tenants are deliberately not paying their rent and when mandatory possession should be granted. The amendment would remove the worst aspects of the change. It would make it clear that, when something is happening to benefit payments that is beyond the tenant's control, it will not create a mandatory ground for possession. As the Under-Secretary said previously, the court has no discretion, but to award that ground to the landlord. I hope that the Under-Secretary will review the matter; it is serious and it could lead to untold hardship for tenants if the clause were accepted in its present form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Brooke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of London and Westminster, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I represent an inner-city seat, with a working population of 750,000. As I said in a previous debate, it would be difficult to imagine a more inner-city seat than mine. Members of Parliament who represent such constituencies are familiar with the fact that about 25 per cent. of the electorate is made up of transient people who move in and out of the area during a year. I must agree with the Opposition that there are delays in housing benefit that clearly get in the way, which is a matter with which Members of Parliament have sympathy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is particularly acute in my constituency. In the 1977 housing survey, 45 per cent. of Westminster's housing stock was listed as being in the private rented sector as against 15 per cent. for the nation as a whole. That may have played some part in Westminster's subsequent housing developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the problem that arises for people coming into accommodation as described by the hon. Member for Lewisham, East. Coming from outside the constituency, it is highly unlikely that he or she will know the name of the local councillor who usually handles housing benefit cases. The person will then come to the local Member of Parliament—I make no complaint about that, but it is a less efficient way of dealing with the matter and does not accelerate the process. There is a problem that requires responsible attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not clear from the terms of the amendment spoken to by the hon. Member for Lewisham, East how the matter would be settled. Would a landlord delay his application for eviction on the ground that he was convinced that the money would be forthcoming? Would the court decide on a matter on which the local authority had been unable to decide in its own housing benefit office? Or would the matter be referred back to the housing benefit office by the court to decide whether there was a legal entitlement? All those factors would cause delay. Notwithstanding the feelings of the Opposition, there is no question but that the landlord will carry the effect of the delay, because he will not be paid the rent, whether it comes from housing benefit or elsewhere. There are some technical questions to clear up before we finish our debate on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is obvious from what I said earlier that I do not believe that the amendment goes far enough. I hope that the Minister will look rather more favourably at the matter so that there is some discretion in the grounds for evicting tenants for nonpayment of rent. Will the Minister think very carefully about the problems that will be encountered when people are paid housing benefit four weeks in arrears? That means that they will have only another four weeks to sort things out if they go wrong. Not only Opposition Members, but a Conservative member of the Committee have referred to the problems that arise when people are trying to sort out housing benefit, in particular. If the Minister ever has the chance to sit in on a housing benefit review board—we shall discuss
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>505</span>
that later—he will realise the sorts of problems that arise. They are real and cause tremendous difficulty. It is also in the interests of landlords to sort out this matter. If they evict people, they will not get their rent at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard a great deal from the Government about part of their housing policy being to do all that they can to prevent homelessness. The amendment is one valuable thing that they could do to ensure that people are not made homeless unnecessarily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hampstead and Highgate)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In common with the right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South (Mr. Brooke), I represent an inner London borough where available housing is, in the main, in the private sector. I am fortunate because the housing benefit department in my local authority of Camden has received a charter mark for the efficiency of its operations. Complaints that have come from my constituents about the non-payment of housing benefit tend to be because the Government have changed the ground rules for claimants. I cite an example of precisely the problem on which the right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South touched. Someone came into my constituency from another part of the country and he was housed in a private property. Each of the properties within the main building had its own front door, but the post was pushed through the main front door—there were no separate post boxes for tenants. Notices went missing not because they had been stolen but because the general passage of people through the hallway tended to scuff the post or people forgot to look for it. Delays can easily occur and I strongly endorse all the points that have been made to the Minister that there are alternatives, as the Law Society said in the briefing that I am sure all members of the Committee have received. It states that the court has
	<br><blockquote><p>"discretion to grant a possession order based on any amount of rent arrears."</p></blockquote>
That change in the law is inordinately draconian when we consider the comparatively short time that a family living under the threat of eviction may have to find an alternative residence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government talk consistently about rents finding a market level and responding to market forces. They are making it difficult for tenants to have any security where it is in the best interests of the landlord to be able to throw them out on the flimsiest grounds in order to charge higher rents. In a previous debate, the hon. Member for Christchurch referred briefly to landlords who on occasion refuse to accept rent from tenants in order to be able to evict them. I know of more than one such case in my constituency. Invariably, the tenant is elderly and the landlord is desperate to get all the tenants out in order to transform a property into one that he or she considers would show a much greater return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that some landlords refuse to consider tenants who depend on housing benefit to pay their rent. The change proposed in the Bill will increase the possibility of homelessness—people literally having nowhere to go. It is important that we do not build into
	<span class='label label-info column'>506</span>
legislation the idea that there are several standards of tenancies. We should not give landlords the opportunity to regard tenants who depend on housing benefit for their rent differently to any other tenant. Clearly, if that ethos is allowed to grow—the change proposed by the Government would fuel it—landlords will be increasingly dismissive of tenants who depend on housing benefit for their rent and less than speedy in carrying out necessary repairs. The draconian change proposed to the law will increase the likelihood of homelessness and of properties being allowed to deteriorate, because landlords will not be especially concerned about those tenants. I strongly urge the Minister to consider the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That is why Shelter Cymru have made strong representations to me about the issues that my hon. Friends have raised.

As has been pointed out, ground 8 is mandatory. So if its conditions are met, the court has no choice but to grant possession. Under the change to payment of benefit in arrears which is due to begin in October 1996, and with the reduction of the conditions of ground 8 from 13 to eight weeks, the Under-Secretary must carefully consider the amendment moved by my hon. Friend for Lewisham, East. Unless the amendment is made, individuals who find themselves in difficulty because of delay in payment of housing benefit will face eviction through no fault of their own. That has been said already by my hon. Friends, and I shall be interested to hear how the Under-Secretary can justify individuals being evicted from properties under mandatory conditions because of changes made by the Government over which those individuals have no control whatever.

If the Under-Secretary has reservations about the genuine problem landlords might face of not receiving income because of housing benefit payment failures, he should explain why he is not looking at the matter from the other angle. I am anticipating what he might say, but why does he intend to reject my hon. Friend's amendment, which seeks to protect tenants? Why does he not consider the ways in which landlords, who face difficulties when benefit is not paid, might have the system speeded up? That would iron out some of the difficulties of benefit payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not spoken to the Opposition Front Bench team about this, but I venture to suggest that there might be grounds for compensation against the Benefits Agency if landlords find themselves in financial difficulty because benefit arrears are not paid. There are many imaginative ways to iron out housing benefit difficulties without tenants losing their homes because of problems not of their making. I mention such matters because I should be interested to know what the Under-Secretary thinks about protecting landlords while not discriminating against
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0289">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>507</span>
tenants. Perhaps he could discuss with his colleagues in the Department of Social Security what steps could be taken about such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fail to understand how the Under-Secretary could reject the amendment as tenants have no control over such circumstances. Shelter Cymru strongly opposes the reduction from 13 weeks to eight weeks which can be obtained under mandatory possession orders. Shelter Cymru is concerned about the problem to which my hon. Friend referred. If the Under-Secretary cannot accept the amendment in its present form, I urge him to consider how to overcome the problem by tackling it from the landlords' point of view. There is no reason why he should not accept the amendment, and I should be interested to know why tenants should suffer because of a problem that is outside their control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest to the arguments that have been advanced. I am sympathetic to some of the concerns expressed, especially those involving individual cases. I listened with particular interest to the speech of my right hon. Friend the Member for City of London and Westminster, South who spoke with great knowledge and authority on the subject. I take on board some of the concerns that he expressed, and I agree with him that there are some problems with the amendment, not least of which is that it might create uncertainty, especially among landlords, about how the grounds for possession operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, a landlord might not be aware that his tenant is claiming housing benefit. Even if he is aware, he is in no position to know the level of benefit to which the tenant is entitled as benefit is means tested and based on a rent officer's determination of a reasonable market rent for the property. Therefore, how is the landlord—or the tenant—meant to work out how much of the rent arrears must be disregarded before the arrears have reached a level where possession proceedings can start?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I not right in thinking that we shall debate the fact that landlords will receive a determination of rents and benefit before tenants do so? Admittedly, that does not happen now. However, if that is so, other changes in the Bill will enable our proposals to be implemented very smoothly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I say this advisedly, but I think that it will be the tenants who can seek a determination and that that determination will not be dependent on tenants' income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Attercliffe was right; it is important for the Committee to have an idea of the time scale involved. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Before he gets too many pats on the back, he should listen to what I have to say. Arrears must have been due for no less than two months or eight weeks—I accept that that is a reduced period, but it is still substantial—before a landlord can seek possession. In addition to that, under the Housing Act 1988 it is incumbent on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>508</span>
landlord to serve notice, which must be for no less than two weeks, so the period under discussion is two months plus two weeks, plus whatever further period it takes for the landlord to obtain a court hearing. That is a substantial period before there is a danger of the mandatory ground for possession being activated at a court hearing. The arrears must be established both when the notice is issued and at the time of the hearing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the Under-Secretary making the point that if a benefit case has not been solved by the time it comes to court, it is probably a highly complicated case that should be subject to particular consideration? The legislation should prevent tenants from being evicted in such circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I turn now to the other aspect of the time scale, and I invite the hon. Gentleman to listen carefully, as the same time scale applies whether the case is simple or complex. The local authority has a statutory duty to process the claim within 14 days of receipt of all the necessary information. I have heard the concerns expressed by the Committee and I appreciate what hon. Members have said about individual cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Department of Social Security statistics show that more than 80 per cent. of housing benefit claims are now processed within the statutory 14 days of all the required information being received. The Committee will be concerned about those cases where it is not processed within that period. In those cases, if the deadline is not met, local authorities have a statutory duty to make payments on account where the delay is not the fault of the tenant. It has been the concern of many members of the Committee in the course of this debate that tenants who are not at fault should not be put in an adverse position and that their interest should be borne in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That safeguard is enshrined in the Housing Benefit (General Regulations 1987). It is a mandatory regulation. Regulation 91 states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the local authority shall make a payment on account of any entitlement to a rent allowance".</p></blockquote>
That covers the case where more than 14 days have elapsed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What advice would the Under-Secretary give the London borough of Brent, which has a policy of withholding benefit payments to tenants of a landlord who is being investigated for fraud?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to know more about that case before commenting. I invite the hon. Gentleman to consider that the regulations are mandatory on local authorities and give tenants the right to seek payments on account. The tenant has the force of the regulations behind him in seeking a payment on account. That is the appropriate way to go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would create uncertainty for landlords. Although I am sympathetic to individual
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0290">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>509</span>
cases, I must advise the Committee to resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has told us twice that he was sympathetic. If we had looked hard, we might have seen a tear in his eye and wondered why he was not getting his handkerchief out. However, the action that he is prepared to take tells us that he has no sympathy at all. He seems to think that it is easy for tenants to exercise their right to get money out of the local authority. My experience is that that is extremely difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give one constituency example of three young people renting a house, with a clear agreement with the landlord that they would each pay a third of the rent. Two of them had difficulty paying the rent, but were paying their share without failing to meet the landlord's deadline when he came round on a Sunday evening to collect it. The third one was clearly entitled to housing benefit, but he worked for a home delivery pizza firm and was self-employed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was extremely complicated for my constituent to demonstrate to the local authority what his earnings were. I do not blame the local authority for being sceptical about the amount of money that he claimed to earn. There may have been some discussion about whether the tips were part of his earnings, but he claimed that he did not receive many tips when he delivered pizzas. However, the position is complicated and what would happen under the Government's new proposal if negotiations between him and the local authority take a long time? Whose fault would that be? The local authority may say that it needs proof of his earnings and he might provide what little evidence he has. However, he would not be able to ask the local authority to pay him on account because it would need proof that he was delivering only so many pizzas. It is difficult to prove that someone is delivering more pizzas than is alleged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman studies regulation 91 he will find that protection is given to someone in the sort of circumstances that he has described. The issue is whether someone furnishes such information, certificates, documents or evidence as an authority reasonably requires. Such a provision offers protection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A local authority could reasonably require proof that someone has not delivered 50 pizzas in an evening, but only 48. Proving that would not be very easy and negotiations would take some time. I do not blame a local authority for being fairly cynical about the number of pizzas that a young man claims to deliver. It is a difficult issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that if the rent has not been paid for eight or 10 weeks, a landlord may apply for repossession. That would involve not just the person employed, but the student and the unemployed person who would also be evicted. That is totally unreasonable. The Under-Secretary must come up with some mechanism that ensures that someone acts as an arbiter between a local authority that claims that
	<span class='label label-info column'>510</span>
its delays are reasonable and an individual tenant who feels that they are not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have heard many Ministers say that they are sympathetic to an argument, but in this case the Under-Secretary's sympathy has not been borne out by even half a phrase in which he said that he would look at the issue again or that he would do something. If he does not move on this issue, I shall be very keen to press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are going through a charade on every amendment. The Under-Secretary says that he is very sympathetic, that we have moved the amendments reasonably and, if one of his hon. Friends speaks, he pays lip service to what he says. On this occasion, the right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South was told that he had been listened to and that his views had been taken into account. The Under-Secretary then says that he will carry on regardless. Before we reach the end of the Bill, he might on one occasion tear up his brief and start living in the real world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the real world, people do not get their housing benefit paid on time in every case and local authorities cannot always obtain the information that they need. The Under-Secretary may say that payment may be made on account if the information that is reasonably required by a local authority is supplied, but the problems in providing information may not just be a tenant's fault. For example, a tenant may have difficulty in obtaining information from his employer. Sometimes, employers do not respond quickly to requests for information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary may argue that very few cases will reach the end of the process involved and that in most cases payment will be made on account. Therefore, he may argue that few cases in which benefit is due will get to court and that a mandatory ground for possession will be given only occasionally. However, if there is one such case, that will be one case too many. If there are so few cases, why cannot the Minister accept our amendment? It would affect few people. However, in the few cases to which it applied, it would help someone who, through no fault of his own, will be evicted. If the Under-Secretary accepts that such an eviction would be wrong—I believe that it would be—he should at least say that he is sympathetic to our amendment. If he does not agree with the wording or believes that it has a technical flaw, he should tell us that he will come back with something else, but we have not even heard that. Unless he can come up with something better, we should challenge the Under-Secretary by pressing the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has heard Opposition Members' enthusiasm for the amendment. Although I am pleased that he listened to the right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South, I wish that he would listen a little bit more and take on board some of the points that the right hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friends have made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster South that my view of what would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0291">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

happen is that the courts would tell a landlord that he or she cannot use that ground, because it is mandatory, while there are outstanding benefit claims.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the strength of the argument that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Prentice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to disagree with the right hon. Gentleman. The amendment would not have that effect. The words

are the important part of the amendment that would ensure that the tenant is protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the right hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson), I have an inner London seat. I know that people think that Lewisham is fairly far out of central London, but it is considered an inner London borough. Like others, it has a transient population. People who are on housing benefit are often the most vulnerable in society, and are least able to challenge the authority or bureaucracy of a local authority or the Benefits Agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) that I hope that he was not attempting to make a spending commitment, because if he was, he would get me into terrible trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that he is sympathetic, but I am not entirely convinced that he is. Even if he were, tea and sympathy will not be sufficient for innocent tenants who will be evicted from their homes through no fault of their own, but through the fault of other people and agencies beyond their control. Given the passion with which my hon. Friends have put their case for the amendment, I will press it to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we come to a vote, if the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my original remarks, I was seeking to ask the hon. Lady how on earth the court would know whether an outstanding housing benefit claim was proper. That is a matter of some practical importance. Unless the hon. Lady can do a little better on the technicalities than she has so far, I cannot vote for her amendment. However, I warn my hon.

the fact that it so ceases to be an assured shorthold tenancy shall, in relation to that application, be disregarded for the purposes of this section.'.".</p></blockquote>
This Government amendment will ensure that a landlord cannot prevent a shorthold tenant from obtaining a reasonable market rent determination from a rent assessment committee during the first six months of the tenancy. Clause 77 will retain shorthold tenants' rights under section 22 of the Housing Act 1988 to apply to a rent assessment committee for a reasonable rent determination in the first six months of the tenancy. If a rent is determined, it will be the legal maximum that the landlord can charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New provisions in schedule 4 to the Bill will allow a landlord to serve a notice on a shorthold tenant that the tenancy is no longer to be a shorthold. That will enable a landlord to replace a shorthold tenancy with a full assured tenancy if he is happy with the tenant. However, a landlord could use the provision in schedule 4 as it is currently drafted to prevent a shorthold tenant from obtaining a reasonable rent determination from a rent assessment committee because the application would be invalidated if the tenancy became a full assured tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most landlords are unlikely to do that because it would involve offering greater security of tenure to the tenant. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of an unscrupulous landlord exploiting that loophole on the basis that the tenant would leave because he would be unable to afford the rent. The amendment closes the loophole. It requires a rent assessment committee to process the application regardless of the fact that the landlord had subsequently served notice that the tenancy was no longer shorthold. It provides an additional safeguard for tenants by preserving their right of referral to a rent assessment committee. I commend the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I admit to a strong sense of déjà vu as I speak to these new clauses. I had the privilege of serving on the Committee that considered the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, when similar amendments were tabled by my hon. Friends, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle). The debate was rooted in what seemed to us then—as now—a gross injustice. The Government are in a sense defining what constitutes a relationship and wilfully ignoring the realities of relationships, including the variety and the difference that are apparent in so many areas of human life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had occasion to speak of a case in my constituency that had been sensitively treated by the London borough of Camden. It concerned a pensioner who had lived in council accommodation for most of her adult life, and when her partner died, she approached Camden council in a great deal of distress, because it had originally regarded her as a lodger. Given her age—we are all products of the times in which we live—she found it very difficult to speak openly to her local authority about a relationship of such intimacy. As I said, Camden has a very enlightened approach to succession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's response to our proposals was that, as the Stonewall survey showed that 52 per cent. of local authorities looked favourably on succession for single-sex couples, there was little that the Government could or should do. The argument was that it was best practice. But as my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mrs. Jackson) said at the time, although 52.7 per cent. of local authorities may look at the issue favourably, it follows that 47.3 per cent. of them do not. I contacted Stonewall today to see whether it was aware of any variation in those percentages, and the division remains the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Towards the end of our debates on those amendments to the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, the Minister responding for the Government led the Committee to believe—justifiably, I think—that a letter would be circulated to all local authorities urging that, as best practice, they should look favourably on the idea of guaranteeing the granting of the same legal rights of succession to single sex as to heterosexual relationships. Indeed, the Viscount of Falkland, tabled a written question in 1993, asking the Government:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What proposals they have to encourage the granting of joint tenancies to couples not covered by Section 113 of the Housing Act 1985 … and, where a joint tenancy does not exist, whether they will in the event of the death of a tenant encourage local authorities to grant new tenancies to any surviving partner (including same-sex partners)."</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord Strathclyde said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government intend shortly to issue guidance to all local housing authorities … The guidance will encourage local authorities to consider granting joint secure tenancies in situations
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0293">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>515</span>
where, 	<i>inter alia,</i> the provision of a sole tenancy may prejudice the ability of other adult members of a household to remain in the accommodation on the death of a partner.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>It will also confirm that the Government do not consider that discrimination on the grounds of ethnic origin, gender, sexual orientation or disability is aceptable in deciding whether or not to grant a tenancy. Where existing households do not enjoy a joint tenancy, authorities will be encouraged to offer joint tenancies and, where they are refused, the Government consider that the local authority should give their reasons in writing."—[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 14 April 1996, vol. 544, c. 	<i>75.</i>]</p></blockquote>
Unfortunately, the present Secretary of State for the Environment, who was not in that post when the reply was given to the Viscount of Falkland, did not issue to local authorities the guidance that was outlined in the reply. In 1996, as in 1993, there is no compulsion on local authorities or housing associations to provide joint tenancies to couples of the same sex.

Only today I received a briefing from the Terrence Higgins Trust, and I regret to inform the Committee, on the strength of the information in that briefing, that since 1993, far from improving, matters have, in many areas, deteriorated. The trust briefing describes two recent cases. In one, Mr. A lived in accommodation owned by small housing association outside London, with no policy on lesbian and gay succession. Mr. A lived with his partner in that property for eight years and cared for him prior to his death in 1995. A possession order was made against Mr. A, when his partner died, to which he had no defence, and on which the judge had no discretion. He therefore lost both his partner and his home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second case of which the Terrence Higgins Trust has informed me concerns Mr. B, who gave up his accommodation to care for his partner, who had AIDS. He lived with and cared for his partner for four years. His partner contacted the Terrence Higgins Trust to ask what would happen to Mr. B when he died. The London borough of Ealing, in which he lives, has no policy on lesbian and gay succession, and there is no protection for him. The Terrence Higgins Trust briefing contains the comment:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It's like a game of roulette. People ring up in great distress. We can give good news to some if they are lucky enough to live in an area where the authority has a good policy. But it should not be a matter of chance. A change to the law would provide equal protection for everybody."</p></blockquote>
The new clauses would enable all local authorities to exercise the kind of compassionate concern that I know many of them already express, and which, as I said earlier, is very much part and parcel of the approach of Camden—my local authority.

We know that in many parts of the country there are still fears in relation to sufferers from AIDS and HIV. I do not want in any way to suggest to the Committee or to anyone outside that I regard that cruel and dreadful disease as being exclusively targeted on the gay and lesbian community: as we know, the largest increase in the number of HIV-positive people has been in the heterosexual community. However, people often find it very difficult to find housing because of neighbours' fears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>516</span>
Most local authorities are already overstretched in the area of housing and should be assisted by the Government by a code of best practice. The Government should put some weight behind what I believe to be simple humanity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Ashby 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-West Leicestershire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening with great interest to what the hon. Lady has been saying. I am very sympathetic; when I was a member of the Greater London council, I introduced such a code of best practice. I also introduced sales to same-sex couples—I am strongly in favour of selling council houses and saw no reason why we should not sell them jointly to such couples. There is a great deal of merit in what the hon. Lady says, but there are always practical difficulties. When is a relationship a settled relationship? Is it after one month, two months, two years, four years or six years? Is not that difficult question best dealt with by a code of best practice rather than by enshrining such matters in law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's sympathy has clearly blurred his eyes and he has not read the new clause precisely. The criterion would be no different from the present statutory criterion for establishing what constitutes a stable relationship for heterosexuals—a relationship of 12 months' standing. All that we ask is that that condition should also apply to single-sex relationships.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the hon. Lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How very kind; I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I add that although I have concentrated in the evidence that I have presented to the Committee today on single-sex relationships that are undoubtedly intimate, there are relationships between men and women who live together in which there is no intimate relation other than friendship. This is an area in which it behoves us to move forward and to accept that there are various kinds of relationship. That could bring an enormous benefit by lifting a genuine burden on many people whose lives are already over-burdened with dreadful situations with which they have to deal: The Government could take a small step that would result in a major transformation in many people's lives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have entered the debate at the eleventh hour, which is why I was ignorant of the relevant period. I hope that I may be forgiven for that. As I said, when I was a member of the Greater London council, we established a code of best practice that had the total support of all my colleagues—Sir Horace Cutler and all the other councillors. We discussed the matter fully and were confident that we should proceed to manage property in that way. I supported that move. I am astounded when I hear of cases such as that of Ealing council, which the hon. Lady mentioned. Clearly, that is not the way for housing to be managed; it is inhumane and wrong.

I come into the debate late, but all I want is for my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to say whether the amendment is unacceptable, and if so, will he give us his reasons and then table an acceptable one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0294">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>517</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would assist the Committee if I were to explain the position under the Housing Acts of 1985 and 1988, whereby local authorities, housing associations and private landlords can grant joint secure and assured tenancies to up to four people. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I shall come to the significance of that shortly, but it would help if I explained the background. The law of succession means that in joint tenancies, the remaining tenants can take over the tenancy. That can help to avoid unfortunate situations in which other adult members of the household who may, for example, have acted as unpaid live-in carers, have no right to remain in their home on the death of the tenant. In the case of a same sex couple, a joint tenancy ensures that when a partner dies, the other does not lose his or her home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that joint secure and assured tenancies can cover up to four people. That is a good point with which we can all go along. But is there a way to ensure that people in the position described by the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate can go to to their local authority to be registered as joint tenants? In other words, can the local authority be forced to register them as joint tenants?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend may have foreshadowed what I am about to say. The statutory provisions that I am describing clearly make provision to deal with the sort of cases that have been mentioned. If that is less than clear to some social landlords, that can be remedied by reminding them of the flexibility provided by joint tenancies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the Under-Secretary putting forward a case that would mean that there should be no need for succession between a man and wife? Surely, they can become joint tenants but, in reality, they often do not, so there has to be provision for succession in those circumstances. It is exactly the same in the case being argued by my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware of the distinction that is drawn in existing legislation on the rights of succession and the reasons for it. I am describing a way in which people can be assisted through the creation of joint tenancies. As I said, we intend to issue guidance on a number of issues flowing from the Bill, not least about the allocation of local authority and housing association tenancies. It will provide the opportunity to remind landlords of the position on succession and the use that can be made of joint tenancies. We have already issued for consultation our intentions on allocations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Under-Secretary explain how guidance will help if a local authority refuses to use it? The guidance may be accepted in one authority, but refused in a neighbouring one, so it would be possible that someone on one side of the street in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate would be treated differently from someone on the other side of the street. How will the Under-Secretary enforce the guidance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>518</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The joint tenancy mechanism is there to protect people living in the circumstances that I described. The guidance will assist local authorities in how to implement the provision. Local authorities must decide what is appropriate when considering how best to make use of their housing stock. We are concerned about the position of those with underlying needs, especially those with children, and, as I said, we shall be issuing guidance. In the light of that, I resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have all-party agreement on the amendment, and I am extremely disappointed that the Minister cannot accept it, as that is a powerful argument for doing so. The hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate has argued her case ably. Guidance notes may or may not be taken up. We have had endless debates about certain things being mandatory. In this case, we want the Minister to make it mandatory. It is quite extraordinary that, for both provisions in the Bill that we wanted to make mandatory, the Under-Secretary should have made all sorts of excuses, saying that it was satisfactory for it not to be mandatory. I hope that he will think again. I realise that it is difficult to assess amendments, because the wording is not right, but we have been through that many times. However, there is widespread agreement that, for all the reasons given by the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate, it is the right thing to do. I hope that the Under-Secretary will reconsider his decision. This is the first time that we have had all-party agreement. The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (Mr. Ashby) was feeling quite put upon by some of us, but we agree with him today. I am pleased that he is with us and that he supports the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it astonishing, given what he said earlier, that the Under-Secretary should take that view. I agree with what the hon. Member for Christchurch said about provisions being mandatory or discretionary. We were speaking earlier about repossession and the Minister said that if, for instance, a tenant was behind with the rent, a landlord could have confidence only if there was an automatic procedure for gaining possession. Anything less than an automatic or mandatory provision was unacceptable. However, when it comes to same sex couples, he suddenly feels that security of tenure has to be based on a discretionary provision—on whether the couple has applied for a joint tenancy, whether they live in a local authority area that has got its act together, or whether they live in a house owned by a landlord who is prepared to accept them. Suddenly, the discretionary approach is acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Under-Secretary a direct question: does he feel that if one member of a same sex couple died, the other person should be turned out onto the streets? Is that acceptable? If not, he must do something about it. So far, only the solution proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate adds up. Anything else would leave matters depending on an accident of geography—a term that we have heard before—and the willingness of the local authority and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0295">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>519</span>
the landlord, not on the stability of the couple's relationship. That is the key point. If the Under-Secretary believes that succession would be automatic if the couple were a man and a woman, but that for a same sex couple it should not be automatic, he should say so. If he does not, he must find another solution to the problem put before us by my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate. The Under-Secretary's response does not address the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I respect the decision of the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire, taken when he was chairman of a housing committee. It was not as easy then to be able to argue convincingly for same sex couples to be treated like everyone else, but a number of councils did so and led the way. I remember that when I was chairman of Sheffield's housing committee, the council's tenancy conditions were revised. There was much consultation on giving the same rights to gay and lesbian people as to heterosexual couples, both for tenancy arrangements and for succession. Perhaps we should have gone further; we learned as time went by how discrimination could still be built into the system, and we had to review and rectify our arrangements accordingly. In the early 1980s, when those arguments were taking place, opposition to what we were trying to do was simply an exposition of blinkered and appalling prejudice. That was not confined to the Conservative party. People in other parties held rather reactionary views on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have moved on a bit, so in 1996 we do not hear that sort of argument as to why nothing should be done. However, we hear arguments from Ministers about joint tenancies. Of course it is right that authorities should give advice to people who are living together as couples, whether they are in a heterosexual or homosexual relationship, that joint tenancies are the best way forward. The point that I sought to make in my intervention was that one can give that advice to people, but they do not always take it. Because they do not always take that advice, the Bill makes provision for succession from one partner to another in heterosexual relationships. We are asking for exactly the same provision for gay and lesbian relationships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not necessarily have to argue this point, bit by bit, on housing legislation. I favour an approach of anti-discrimination legislation on sexuality, which we ought to bring in across the board. We are all clear that we are talking about about housing on this occasion. It therefore boils down to the issue of whether we are prepared to accept that people who enter, through their own choice, homosexual relationships have a basic right to be treated before the law in the same way as people who enter heterosexual relationships. I believe that they have and that there is a basic principle. The right to be equal before the law is different from the right to have ministerial guidance given, which authorities may or may not choose to
	<span class='label label-info column'>520</span>
accept. That is absolutely fundamental. Ministers can provide all the guidance they want, but, in the end, authorities may choose to ignore it. This is the sort of principle that we in Parliament should be saying should be written into our basic law, not into guidance or regulations. I hope that the Minister will reflect on and accept the new clause. It is fundamental, as we are talking about a basic human right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remain unmoved. The hon. Members for Attercliffe and for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Burden) have failed to take on board what I said earlier about joint tenancies and the use to which they can be put.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend say whether there is a fundamental reason why relationships such as those that we have been talking about should not be subject to succession? We are talking in terms of settled relationships of long standing. I had a close relation, who died recently, who was homosexual. I saw how devastating that was for his partner of 23 or 24 years. He crumbled when his partner died, and the thought that he would have had to leave their home at the same time would have absolutely destroyed him when he was destroyed enough already. Why should we not allow succession? What is fundamentally wrong? Are not we in a society that is changing, and if it is not changing, should not we in Parliament be changing it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I heard my hon. Friend's point. I hope that he will listen carefully to what I say about joint tenancies, which can also be of benefit to other people, whom I am sure he feels deeply about, such as those who have been unpaid, live-in carers and who are not in the sort of relationship that he described. I hope that he will take on board the significance of joint tenancies and, in those circumstances, I will resist the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have finished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister has significantly failed to listen to what hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have been saying to him. I am extremely grateful for the cross-party support and the passion and clarity with which hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have expressed their concerns to the Minister. It has become clear, during this brief debate on something that I regard as being vital, as do many other Members of the Committee, that we are arguing for basic simple human rights such as genuine justice and equality before the law. We are arguing for something that is intrinsic and vital to the development of society: the right to share life within a home—the good and the bad, the ups and the downs—and to know that, whoever goes first, the one who is left will have the right to live in the same, shared space.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel a dangerous tendency to sentimentalise my argument, which I do not wish to do. The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire gave a good
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0296">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>521</span>
example. The death of a loved one is a tragedy and to have it exacerbated, as it is even in this day and age, by the loss of a home is to be deeply regretted, as is the fact that the Minister cannot take such a matter on board. As there is some cross-party unity and because so many of us think that the issue is vitally important, I must put the new clause to the vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
