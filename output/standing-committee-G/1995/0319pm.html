<p><i>Amendment proposed</i> [<i>this day</i>]: No. 539, in page 73, line 11, leave out "reasonable or".—[<i>Mrs. Maddock.</i>]</p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are discussing amendment No. 534, in page 73, leave out lines 13 to 15.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration (Mr. David Curry)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was replying to the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock). I believe that the hon. Lady was objecting to the fact that the Government were taking an order making power. I was about to explain that we needed an order making power to update legislation and to bring it into line with court judgments. In the past, that has taken some time. Such a power would enable us to do so more rapidly and more effectively.<br><br>
An order making power will enable the Secretary of State to clarify the law if a court decision calls into question the meaning of a particular provision and the general understanding of how the system is supposed to operate. The amendments to the homelessness legislation introduced in the Housing and Planning Act 1986, which ensured that someone in temporary accommodation could still be homeless, did just that. However, it was several years after the initial court decision before such clarification was provided. The power will enable us to move more quickly. In general, we intend to use it to safeguard the proper rights of homeless households.<br><br>
Amendment No. 539 seeks to ensure that the order making power can be used only in that way. I understand that; but there have been instances when the decisions of the courts have involved an unexpectedly broad interpretation of the law, which imposed a consequent burden on local authorities before being overturned on appeal. We need to be able to take the proper action in such cases. However, I assure the hon. Lady that we have no intention of restricting entitlement under the homelessness legislation to a position less favourable than is at present commonly understood.<br><br>
Amendment No. 534 is based on a misunderstanding of the nature of the powers that we seek. Subsection (1) makes a clear reference to the circumstances under which it is not unreasonable to continue to occupy property—namely, where there is violence or a threat of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 722</span>
violence. Subsection (3)(a)—which the amendment would retain—would allow an order to specify other such circumstances—again, in an absolute sense.<br><br>
Subsection (2) sets out other factors that an authority should take into account in reaching decisions on individual cases; it cites the housing situation prevailing in the area. Subsection (3)(b) would allow an order to specify other matters that an authority should take into account in forming a view. For example, an order might refer to factors such as access to facilities or services essential to an individual's well being. To make such an order, we should need to rely on the provision contained in subsection (3)(b). Both limbs of subsection (3) are needed, so I invite the hon. Lady to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Diana Maddock <span class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The intention was to ensure that regulations could be made only to keep legislation in step with positive developments in case law. I think that the Minister gave me some reassurance on that. Will he double check with lawyers that the wording of subsection (3) will achieve that? With such an assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

DUTY OF LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE ADVISORY SERVICES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 480, in page 73, line 17, leave out from "that" to "is" in line 18 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"a comprehensive housing and homelessness advice and advocacy service."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 535, in page 73, line 19, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(1A) The authority shall include within the service to be provided under subsection (1) assistance by way of grant or loan to voluntary organisations concerned with homelessness and related matters.".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 481, in page 73, line 27, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'(4) Every local housing authority shall—
<ol>
<li>publish and disseminate information about services provided by them under subsection (1);</li>
<li>where they consider it appropriate, publish and disseminate information about the provision by others (including, in particular, voluntary organisations) of services which the authority has power to provide under subsection (1); and</li>
<li>take such steps as are reasonably practicable to ensure that those who might benefit from the services receive the information relevant to them.'.</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 480 and 481. Information and advice are extremely important for tenants or prospective tenants—those who are homeless or who may be threatened with homelessness—who do not always have ready access to all the information that they might need in their particular and difficult circumstances. Indeed, I am sure that when we, ourselves, face a crisis, we do not always find it easy to sort out exactly where to go for advice on how to deal with a particular problem. That is certainly true for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0412">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 723</span>
homeless families or those who have major housing problems. Very often, such problems overwhelm families; they need a ready point of access to advice from trained and professional people.<br><br>
We welcome the commitment in the clause, as it stands. Subsection (1) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Every local housing authority shall secure that advice and information about homelessness, and the prevention of homelessness, is available free of charge to any person in their district."</p></blockquote>
However, we do not believe that that requirement goes far enough. While a local authority may choose to fulfil whatever requirement is necessary to meet certain circumstances in its neighbourhood, we believe that that requirement should be stronger.<br><br>
Amendment No. 480 would strengthen the clause by saying that the advice should be comprehensive and related to housing issues as well as homelessness, because it is important to view housing in the wiser sense. While we recognise that the Government see the need for advice on preventing homelessness, that is fairly narrow. We want to ensure that advice will be given on issues such as harassment by landlords against tenants, rent problems, tenancy agreements and so on. Such issues arise for tenants in the private sector and in local authorities and housing associations, and they, as well as the homeless, need advice. It is important, too, to ensure that an advocacy service is available. All too often, individuals in need of advice also need someone to help them to put their case forward, because they become overwhelmed by the bureaucratic and administration processes.<br><br>
The change in the circumstances of cases going to the small claims court has been brought to my attention. Cases up to the value of £3,000 rather than £1,000, as it used to be, are now included. Tenants in poverty who may previously have been entitled to legal aid when taking on a landlord with much greater means are not now so entitled. An advocacy service in the local authority would help them to resolve such difficulties. That is why amendment No. 480 includes a requirement for that service.<br><br>
Amendment No. 481 recognises that local authorities could have the best service in the world. A local authority could provide an excellent service or it could simply be a service in name only. Whatever it is, information about it should be regularly available so that people understand that the service exists. Homeless people or those with housing difficulties are often under pressure and overwhelmed by their problems and they do not always know where to turn. Information about the service should be published and disseminated so that people know about it.<br><br>
The local housing authority should also publish information about services provided by other organisations, such as Shelter, so that people know where to go for assistance. Paragraph (c) of amendment No. 481 proposes that the authority shall
<br><blockquote><p>"take such steps as are reasonably practicable to ensure that those who might benefit from the services receive the information relevant to them."</p></blockquote>
Again, we are trying to ensure that such information is available in places where people who need it are likely to go. There is no point in it being stuck in a gloomy
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 724</span>
corner of a town hall or civic office. It should be up front and advertised widely in citizens advice bureaux and other places where people with housing problems can go.<br><br>
I hope that there is no great argument of principle between us and the Government about the matter, as this is a well-intentioned amendment. People in such difficult circumstances need a slightly wider service from local authorities than the Government at present require the authorities to provide. Information should be made available and people must know where it is held. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment, as such information will be crucial to people in difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to amendment No. 535. I hope that local authorities will not think that I do not believe that they provide a good service; they do, and it is extremely good that they will be under a statutory duty to provide an advice service. However, we want that advice service to be independent. Different situations arise in different areas. I have but a handful of council houses in my constituency, so it is appropriate, in some cases, that an advocacy service is provided by the local authority as well as housing associations.<br><br>
People are sometimes not happy with the decisions and advice that they receive from their local authority. Therefore, it is important that they can receive more advice from a wider area. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) referred to Shelter, but many other voluntary organisations such as the citizens advice bureaux give valuable advice and help people with the advocacy that they need when appealing against various decisions.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will accept our amendment, which would broaden the intention that everyone should have access to independent advice. Voluntary organisations provide independent advice in a way that a commercial organisation would not do. Our proposal would strengthen the other two amendments. It would help to prevent people from becoming homeless and ensure that even some of the measures that we do not like in the Bill would work to the best advantage of those in need of housing services. The amendments share the same spirit and I wait with interest to hear if the Minister has valid reasons why they should not be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Ashby <span class='memberconstituency'>(North-West Leicestershire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have read the amendments, but I am struck by how far advanced our general approach to housing is under the Bill. The clause places a duty on the local housing authority to provide advisory services. Given that so many advisory services have been provided on a voluntary basis in the past, that is a most tremendous advance. To have such a provision in the Bill shows how far forward social trends have come and what sort of Government are in power. Undoubtedly, they are very caring, despite what is said to the contrary by those who fail to understand what the Government are doing.<br><br>
The wise local authority will not take on such services itself; it will pass them to those who have the expertise and who will be able to provide those services with the financial support of the authority. Most local authorities
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0413">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 725</span>
are moving in that direction; only particularly bad authorities, such as the Camden councils of this world, want to take all government to themselves and do everything themselves, rather than put out services to others who are more able.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
The amendment contains the word "shall" in relation to providing grants and assistance to various local bodies. I can envisage people getting awfully autocratic and saying that one organisation will be approved, while another organisation that they do not like and is unhelpful will not. It would be much better to use the word "may" and to make the powers permissive—to depend upon the collective wisdom of local government and councillors to do as they see right according to what their area needs. We must not be too forceful.<br><br>
We get stirred up and have wonderful political discussions about local government—I mentioned Camden council as an example in an attempt to raise a bit of a stir—but actually there are people in local government who are working hard and who know their area, and we must give them the rein to make their own decisions and do things themselves, rather than dictate to them from above.<br><br>
It has been argued with some force that there is a need for independent advice. I had the advantage this morning of being successfully lobbied on the subject and have taken that argument on board. When we talk about independence, we are talking about independence from the local authority itself. Much advice may not sit kindly upon the ears of the local authority. This morning I listened to citizens advice bureaux, which traditionally give such independent advice. We must encourage such organisations to give such advice.<br><br>
Two aspects concern me. The first is that there should be a degree of independence. Local authorities should be encouraged not to set up their own grandiose departments but to make use of what is already available to achieve what they want. The second matter that worries me slightly is whether the trigger mechanism will get help to those who need it. We must always remember that we can legislate, but we need to be pragmatic in our legislation. We are dealing with the kind of people who may not read very much and who may throw material away, or people who may be distressed and not in a position to consider written advice carefully. It is important that authorities should make information available in the simplest and clearest possible way.<br><br>
We must steer away from the amendments and allow responsibility to pass to those in the voluntary sector, not force local authorities to do things. We must accept that they have the will to do them. We should push down that path, because that way we will be far more successful. This is an excellent clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hampstead and Highgate)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (Mr. Ashby) for not having been present to hear every word of his contribution, but I understood him to have referred to my local authority—Camden. I understood the tone of the hon. Gentleman's remarks on the issue of Camden's management of its housing stock to be somewhat critical. If I understood the hon. Gentleman correctly, he was critical of Camden's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 726</span>
unwillingness to hand over that management to other bodies. May I point out to him that my local authority is consistently praised by the Department of the Environment for its management of its housing? It has already received a charter mark for the efficiency of its housing benefit department. It was not Camden that was reluctant to pass over the management of its properties to other organisations—it was Camden's tenants. They voted strongly in favour of the management of their estates remaining with the local authority whose difficulties, they well knew, had been imposed on it by 16 years of Conservative Government.<br><br>
I rose to defend my local authority and my constituents, many of whom still feel aggrieved that the management of their estates by the local authority that has taken such good care of them for so many years was brutally wrested from it by the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Brooke <span class='memberconstituency'>(City of London and Westminster, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether I am declaring common cause with the hon. Member for Hampstead and High-date (Ms Jackson) or declaring an interest, but I am, I think, the only member of the Committee who has ever served on the London Borough of Camden, and I say that with pride.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: A choice between Camden and Westminster.<br><br>
I hope that we can take the opportunity to pay tribute to the work of national and local organisations that provide housing advice. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate said, local authorities have become expert in ensuring that the voluntary sector has acquired expertise. Owing to the lack of resources, local authorities have not been able to provide the expert advice that is needed. Many good national groups and local groups have dealt with local needs and local areas that needed support, some of them in my constituency.<br><br>
There is not much between us concerning what is in the clause—it is a step in the right direction. The amendment is explicit, because the wording of the clause is too bland. I hope that the Minister will adopt the spirit and intent of the amendment, which will bring us where we want to be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have moved into a section of the Bill where we are essentially agreed on our purpose. We must try to define how to get there and establish the reasonable frontiers of what a housing authority can be asked to do. We may be able to find common ground on that.<br><br>
For those who are worried about the need for competition between local authorities to be efficient, the local government performance indicators are due out shortly, so everyone will be able to see for himself the relative performance of his local authority. I suspect that we will find ups and downs across the piece.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe) said, local authorities and voluntary organisations are not hermetically sealed, separate organisations. There is movement between them, the most recent example being the present director of Shelter, who was head of housing at Camden. The expertise flows across the sector. We
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0414">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 727</span>
must not fall into the trap of thinking that there is a corpus of expertise in one sector which is different from that in another sector. I understand that the local authority advice workers, who are in a sense housing professionals, are currently forming a professional association. They should be relied on to operate the system fairly and impartially.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Raynsford <span class='memberconstituency'>(Greenwich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should tell the Minister that the Association of Housing Aid was formed in the early 1970s. As one of its founder-members, I am astonished by the arrival of another body 18 years later. I welcome an increase in such organisations, but the one being formed is not the first.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly would not wish to suggest that. I note that organisations tend to spring up and then try to merge. I am watching with interested detachment the creation of one big happy family among local authority associations.<br><br>
The advice services provided by or for the local authority should go as far as advising people of their right to challenge local authority decisions on homelessness. As to the applications under the new review process under clause 161, I do not know whether it is necessary to provide for an advocacy role—that must be a matter of discretion.<br><br>
Amendment No. 480 seeks to extend the range of services in clause 139, which places a new duty on authorities to ensure that information and advice about homelessness and the prevention of homelessness are available to everyone. The amendment would require authorities to provide services which could give advice about anything relating to housing. Presumably, that would include advice about repair grants, planning permission and boundary disputes, which are not issues that should be addressed by homelessness services. There is a strong case for allowing the authority to decide the precise issues and areas that services should cover, as different areas will require different types and levels of service. We will be issuing new guidance about what the advisory services might cover, and we hope to publish research on current practice, but we would not wish to dictate how the services should be provided; nor would we wish to compel local authorities to provide advocacy services that are to be directed against them, other than in ensuring that people know their right to request a review of a homelessness determination. If authorities wish to fund advocacy services, they will be able to do so under the clause.<br><br>
Amendment No. 535 would require authorities to provide grants to voluntary organisations that provide advisory services about homelessness under subsection (1) of clause 139. Subsection (1) gives local authorities a duty to secure the provision of those services, and subsection (2) gives them the power to give grants to voluntary organisations for providing such services. It will be for authorities to decide how they want to secure the provision of such services. They will not have to provide them directly, although they can if they wish to. If authorities want to ensure that they have a good advisory service, they will need to take account of voluntary organisations in their strategies.<br><br>
Amendment No. 535 would take away an authority's power to decide how to secure the provision of advisory
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 728</span>
services. It would require them to give grants to any voluntary organisation that provides some service, regardless of the authority's assessment of the most appropriate way in which to meet its area's requirements, so I believe that the amendment is unnecessary.<br><br>
Amendment No. 481 is also unnecessary. If authorities are required to provide or secure the provision of advisory services, they will need to ensure that their client group is aware of them. The amendment would add further to both the duties and cost burdens of local authorities by requiring them to provide information about and publicise advisory services provided either by themselves or by voluntary organisations under clause 139. That is a matter of good practice, and I think that it should be for authorities to decide what is appropriate in each case. However, there seems no necessity to require them by law, to advertise, when it is clearly in their own interests to do so—for instance, in helping to reduce the number of homelessness applications. As I mentioned earlier, the guidance that we shall issue will cover advisory services, and such good practice issues. When we draw up the guidance, I shall bear in mind the comments that have been made during our debate, but I ask that the hon. Member for Attercliffe does not pursue the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister to say that the clause is a requirement to provide homelessness advice, but not advice on other housing services, but that the local authority is free to provide such wider advice. I accept that, but I should be happier if authorities had to provide wider housing advice.<br><br>
There is a difficulty concerning advocacy, however, arising from the fact that the clause imposes a requirement, but does not go further. That can give rise to challenges as to whether, because the Bill gives rights in certain areas, it denies that authorities have rights in other areas. In other words, because the clause deals with the giving of advice on homelessness only, and does not specifically exclude advocacy, problems can arise in the courts—I have experience of such a case. The vires of an authority may be questioned, because only one type of service—the advisory service—is mentioned in the Bill, and advocacy is excluded.<br><br>
I listened to what the Minister said about giving guidance to the authorities, and I hope that he will specifically say that advocacy services can be included in the package of services. That would remove any future problems about vires.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
We shall not press either amendment to a Division. I listened to the Minister's comments about amendment No. 481, which would require authorities to inform people that advice services are available and are not, as I said earlier, hidden in a dark corner of a town hall. I should prefer it if the amendment were included in the Bill. I welcome the fact that the Minister said that he would make it clear in his guidance notes that good practice is to make such information freely available, so that those who need advice are aware that such services exist. With those assurances, I shall withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

ment, I shall call the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock), who caught my eye.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seemed to think that the purpose of my amendment was to ensure that all advice was independent. However, that is not the case: my purpose in it was to ensure that an element of independent advice was available in a local authority, especially with regard to advocacy. In his guidance notes, will the Minister stress the importance of truly independent advice being available in an authority?</span></p>

APPLICATION FOR ASSISTANCE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 482, in page 74, line 33, after 'where', insert
<br><blockquote><p>'either—
<ol>
<li>a person appears to the local housing authority to be homeless or threatened with homelessness, or</li>
<li>'.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
Perhaps I should divulge to the Committee that the Chairman and I earlier travelled together on the same train.<br><br>
The amendment is designed to broaden the clause and to place an onus on local authorities to assess and to meet local needs more effectively. It would require local housing authorities to make and to initiate inquiries without necessarily receiving an application from a homeless person. There are many examples whereby that would be advantageous to a person who is, unfortunately, homeless. For example, a local housing authority could conduct inquiries to assist the local social services department, which may have visited a person who has a legal eviction notice against him but who is unclear about what that notice means and who has not approached the housing authority for assistance.<br><br>
The provision of housing advice could resolve various problems that are suffered by people who face eviction—and potential homelessness—without realising it. A housing authority may frequently come across individuals through other departments who have housing difficulties but who are unaware that they have to apply for housing under current arrangements.<br><br>
The current best practice that the Government have recommended is that local authorities should not wait for formal applications to be made before accepting responsibility under legislation relating to homelessness. As the clause is currently drafted, it states that new homelessness provisions will apply only when
<br><blockquote><p>"a person applies to a local housing authority".</p></blockquote>
The amendment states that what currently constitutes good practice, which has been recommended by the Government, should continue.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 730</span>
The current code of guidance reminds authorities that the onus is on them to identify who may be homeless. The present duty that is contained in part III of the Housing Act 1985 arises whenever anyone who is homeless or is about to become homeless approaches a local authority for help in finding or keeping accommodation. The 1985 Act does not require applications in writing or in a particular form. Those applying on waiting lists, making housing benefit claims or complaining about house conditions may be regarded as technically homeless. That is important because it means that authorities should have arrangements in place to refer applications to the appropriate department, regardless of which department has been approached about a problem relating to homelessness. There should be no need for a formal application. Any local authority department coming across concerns on homelessness issues should have input on assessing and putting forward someone for a housing application under homelessness legislation.<br><br>
That is important because, even with the code of guidance and the code of good practice in place, voluntary organisations have identified considerable concern on the issue. Shelter, for example, discovered that only 42 per cent. of authorities registered homeless applicants on their first visit to a homelessness officer. Only three in 10 authorities permitted the first officer seen to register an application.<br><br>
The clause puts the onus on the individual, the provisions applying.
<br><blockquote><p>"where a person applies to a local housing authority".</p></blockquote>
We fear that that may send a signal to some local authorities that assistance can be given to homeless individuals only when a formal application has been made. The amendment would ensure that best practice, which the Government support, was partly enshrined in the Bill, making it clear that anyone who appeared to a housing authority or to any department of a local authority to be homeless or threatened with homelessness would automatically be considered for homelessness assistance.<br><br>
The amendment has wide support from many voluntary organisations, including Shelter, Centrepoint, Age Concern, citizens advice bureaux and Barnardo's. It would clarify the clause and ensure hat no one would slip through the net and be found to be in need through not having made an application. Local authorities, in whatever form, would be able to pick up on an application when someone came before them.<br><br>
The amendment is important. It adds to the Bill and I hope that the Minister accepts it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly perplexed. The suggestion behind the amendment is that local authorities should go to look for people in difficulty and bring them into the net of care. Outreach workers and voluntary organisations generally provide the expertise for that. One of their aims is to try to persuade—sometimes persuasion is necessary—such a person to move gradually into a more structured environment in which care and some form of stable existence can be provided. That is difficult. Some people move in and out of shelters and can be reluctant to enter a more structured environment. I am concerned that a local authority might be deemed to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0416">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 731</span>
have failed in its duties if it were not able to find people. I am sure that the hon. Member for Delyn would not want that to be the case.<br><br>
The issue can best be dealt with by effective cooperation between voluntary organisations and outreach workers, who bring such people to the attention of the local authority and within the purview of the legislation, rather than by placing an obligation on the local authority to go and look. I have my doubts about how effective such a system would be. The changes that the Bill makes to the 1985 Act are drafting rather than substantive changes. The local authority is not constrained from proposing to somebody in the circumstances described by the hon. Member for Delyn that there would be an advantage in making an application under the homelessness legislation. It is even less likely that a person would be short of guidance under the new regime because of the duty imposed on local authorities by clause 139 to provide advice. Therefore, the amendment is unnecessary, and I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it. I shall reflect on what he said and try to ensure that co-ordination between the activities of voluntary organisations, housing authorities and other statutory bodies, which we shall discuss in the context of later amendments, is such as to deal effectively with the sort of problem that he has identified.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am reassured by what the Minister has said. What is important is that no one should slip through the net as a result of a lack of suitable guidance and support from the local authority. Given that the Minister has emphasised that the guidance in current best practice is still operational, and that he will review the matter, I hope that there will be an opportunity to advise local authorities of the guidance so that, whichever department deals with a homeless person, the local authority will be aware of the case. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 552, in page 74, line 43, leave out "social" and insert "housing".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 553 to 557.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are technical amendments. The Bill as currently drafted uses the expression "social assistance", which is unfamiliar. I prefer to use the practical expression "housing assistance", which describes what we are talking about better than that other somewhat vague expression. The amendments do not alter the practical effect of the provisions.<br><br>
The purpose of clause 145 is to enable entitlement to assistance under the homelessness legislation to be aligned with entitlement to housing benefit. The term "social assistance" is a broad term, which has no particular significance in this context. The term "housing assistance" is more suitable and appropriate.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient *****to take amendment No. 444, in page 75, line 7, leave out from "assistance" to end of line 9 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(b) whether he is homeless;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(c) whether he is in priority need;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(d) whether he is homeless intentionally; and</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(e) whether he has a local connection with the authority receiving the application.".</p></blockquote>
and amendment No. 440, in page 75, line 8, leave out first "if so,".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I very much regret the shift in the Bill and in other Conservative legislation away from assessment on the basis of need and towards making a decision on the basis of whether a person comes from abroad—to use the term in clause 145(1).<br><br>
However, that is not the point that I want to make in relation to the amendments. I am concerned that clause 144 imposes on the staff of homeless persons units unrealistic burdens in requiring them to determine the immigration status of every applicant. Clause 144 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"they shall make such inquiries as are necessary to satisfy themselves—"</p></blockquote>
about eligibility, which is further explained in clause 145.<br><br>
If the wording is left as it stands, it will represent an unrealistic, bureaucratic imposition on already hard-pressed units dealing with homeless people. My amendment is practical and would make the Bill's requirements manageable so that assessment of eligibility and immigration status would need to be made only where there was reason for doubt.<br><br>
During the break in our deliberations, I attended the national poverty hearing at Church house. One of the participants was an Asian woman from Bristol, who spoke eloquently of her recent experience of homelessness. She said that her family had gone into homelessness as a family but had emerged from it as a group of individuals having in common merely a nightmare. That is the reality of homelessness.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
I hope that we shall be vigilant in resisting the erection of unnecessary hurdles; such obstacles serve only to humiliate people. Unless there is good reason for doing so, querying people's immigration status and casting doubt on whether they should be in the country at all or whether they are entitled to the benefits of citizenship is a heavy additional indignity to impose on those who are enduring homelessness. If there are grounds for such questioning, the amendment will allow for it. I hope that the Minister will agree that the test of eligibility should be applied only where there are reasons to doubt the eligibility of the homeless person in question. On that basis, I hope that that small change is accepted, because it will help to make the process manageable.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Brooke <span class='memberconstituency'>(City of London and Westminster, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is an index of the Committee's productivity that I should now be speaking to amendment No. 444 to clause 144, and I shall shortly have the privilege of speaking to amendment No. 445 to clause 145. I am diffident about pressing my amendment to a vote because it depends on a slightly improbable precept of C.S. Lewis, which, roughly stated, was that if you hear of someone going around doing good to others, you can always tell the others by their hunted look.<br><br>
The clause summarises the test that is to be applied to determine whether any duty is owed to the applicant. I suggest that it would be clearer if, as in part III of the Housing Act 1985, all the tests were to be listed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In this legislation we are providing that prescribed groups of persons from abroad are not eligible for assistance under the homelessness legislation, other than for housing advice. The provisions of clause 144 mean that before deciding whether someone is entitled to assistance—that is, in priority need and unintentionally homeless—the local authority must determine whether the individual is a person from abroad who is not eligible for assistance within a prescribed group. Amendments Nos. 439 and 440 would require an authority to check on eligibility only if it had reason to believe that the individual might be ineligible. That is a weaker test than the one proposed, and it could be more easily avoided.<br><br>
I would expect that all local authorities will want to ensure that they are discharging their homelessness duties in accordance with the law. The checks that an authority might apply need not be onerous. Currently, authorities are bound to establish whether an applicant is an asylum seeker or is in the country in breach of the immigration laws. The homelessness code of guidance was revised in December 1994 to include advice on handing applications from such people, and it contains a model screening procedure for inquiries about immigration status. The purpose of that procedure is to allow authorities to build screening checks into the questions they ask of everyone who approaches them for assistance under homelessness legislation and thereby to avoid focusing unfairly on members of any particular ethnic group. We shall be updating guidance on the screening procedure when the code is reissued following enactment of the Bill.<br><br>
I do not believe that there is a particular problem for authorities in making reasonable checks on the immigration status of everyone with whom they deal. I cannot, therefore, accept the amendment.<br><br>
I doubt that there is much ground between the Government and my right hon. Friend the Member for City of London and Westminster, South (Mr. Brooke) on the intention behind amendment No. 444, which seeks to make the operation of the legislation clearer. The substantive effect of the amendment would be to specify the main checks that an authority must carry out in order to establish whether it has a duty towards a person under part VII; however, it omits to mention the effect of clause 155, which deals with the availability of alternative accommodation.<br><br>
Clearly, the legislation must be unambiguous about the action that an authority must take to establish that it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 734</span>
has a duty. Although the various provisions and checks to be made are set out in a number of places, they follow on from one to another and the logic is clear. Professionals quickly learn the architecture of the new legislation and take up the language of an Act with their own shorthand of terms such as "a section 64 notice" or "a section 65(3) case". A planning law, people used to talk about "a section 52" and now talk about "a section 106". We of course intend to issue guidance, at least in draft form, before the legislation takes effect which will ensure that the profession and the voluntary sector know their way around the provisions. I hope that that assurance will satisfy my right hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise to observe, in support of the right hon. Member for the City of London and Westminster, South, that the original wording of the 1977 Act as carried forward into part HI of the 1985 Act was clearer, more precise and less ambiguous than the wording of the new legislation. While putting a case for change, the Minister has not satisfied the principal objective of clarity. I also note that he mentioned a shorthand—people referring to "a section 65(3) notice", for example. Sadly, that will go out of currency. If the Bill proceeds, we will have to refer to a section 144(3) notice. I do not think that that is progress.<br><br>
My main reason for speaking is to express disappointment that the Minister has not responded more sympathetically to the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Timms). There is no doubt that within communities of people who have come from overseas and communities which contain a substantial number of asylum seekers, there is real disquiet about the trend of Government policy. There is a feeling that people are subject to undue persecution and that their affairs are being looked into in an intrusive and unsympathetic way. It would not have been a breach of Government policy to have accepted our amendment. It would simply have sent a message to local authorities that they should continue to treat those who come to see them as homeless people as human beings and not to subject them all to what in many cases can be an intimidating and, in some cases, degrading process of requiring them to demonstrate their immigration status. Sadly, documentary evidence shows that all too often it is black people who are subject to the tests. The impact of that on race relations is not healthy. The Minister could have accepted the amendment without breaching his Government's policy. It is disappointing that he has chosen not to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am disappointed by what the Minister said. He did, however, hint at the faint possibility that something in the guidance note might state how the test will be applied, which might encourage local authorities to apply it in a narrow rather than a broad way. In the hope that that will be the case, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss amendment No. 483, in page 75, line 9, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) Where the applicant is a young person under the age of 18 those inquiries shall include an assessment, to be carried out in conjunction with the social services authority for that area, as to whether or not the applicant shall be taken to be in need under section 17(10) of the Children Act 1989.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may not have escaped the Committee's notice that the amendments are similar. Their purpose is clear. We are concerned about young people under the age of 18 and want to ensure that housing departments and social services work together so that those people qualify as being in reasonable need. There is a considerable overlap between the provisions of the Children Act 1989 and the Housing Act 1985. It is to be hoped that there will also be an overlap between the 1989 Act and the Bill which will be on the statute book later this year—unless we have a general election before then, which is one way in which we could defeat the Bill.<br><br>
It is clear that the successful integration of the two Acts has depended on effective liaison between social services and housing departments. It is clear, too, that the outcome has not been uniform throughout the country. I am grateful to the citizens advice bureaux for three examples of the problems experienced by young people as a result of the lack of co-ordination.<br><br>
Young people of 16 and 17 are one of the most vulnerable groups on the streets. We all know what can happen to them if they do not have a roof over their heads and what they can be led to do to get money. Some end up in child prostitution, some are prey to other unwanted attention. My three examples show how vulnerable 16 and 17-year-olds can fall through the net if we do not ensure adequate liaison between social services and housing departments.<br><br>
A citizens advice bureau in Derbyshire reported that a 17-year-old still at school had been thrown out of the family home. There was a history of family breakdown and a social worker had been involved in the past. The bureau reported that the girl was being passed from pillar to post, from the social services department to the homeless department, and neither was prepared to offer accommodation to that very vulnerable young lady.<br><br>
In west Yorkshire, the citizens advice bureau reported the case of a 16-year-old who had been living away from home for nine months. He had been staying with friends, was thrown out and had been sleeping in a shed for the three nights before he turned up at the CAB, which contacted the social services. The department disclaimed any responsibility for homeless young people.<br><br>
A citizens advice bureau in south Wales reported a 16-year-old whose parents had thrown her out and refused to have her back. She had been staying with friends and had become involved with the police, who had passed her on to a social worker. The social worker could find her immediate accommodation only in a children's home. She did not like that much, so she left.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 736</span>
The homeless persons' officer said that since she had refused help from social services, there was nothing that the department could do. That is the most disturbing of the three cases: the 16-year-old girl was left on the streets with no one willing to help her. I hope that the Minister will understand the purpose of the amendment, and that even if he and his lawyers do not like its wording, he will ensure that the Bill provides for co-ordination.<br><br>
Like the hon. Member for Newham, North-East, I, too, briefly attended the poverty hearing today at Church House. What emerged from my conversations there was the problem of the lack of co-ordination between departments in respect of different Acts of Parliament. The amendment would ensure that there was better co-ordination and I hope that the Minister will look favourably upon it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The two amendments are similar. The hon. Member for Newham, North-East talked about working in conjunction with the social services authorities. That would put the matter more effectively within the scope of the legislation.<br><br>
The amendments seek to require the housing authority, in conjunction with the social services authority, to assess whether any young person under the age of 18 who applies for assistance as homeless is a child "in need" under the Children Act 1989. We expect housing authorities to work closely with social services departments in assessing and addressing the needs of homeless young people. However, it may not be necessary to carry out a full assessment under the Children Act for every individual, and it would be impractical to place a duty on housing authorities to make inquiries that can be made only by social services authorities. We will address the interface between the homelessness legislation and the Children Act in the guidance that we issue.<br><br>
My Department and the Department of Health issued a joint circular in 1992 to housing authorities and social services authorities explaining how they should work together to integrate housing and community care services. Since then, we have worked closely with the Department of Health to provide authorities with guidance on joint commissioning, community care charters and housing strategies. Together with the Department of Health, we organised four regional seminars last year to encourage joint working between housing authorities, social services departments and health authorities. We are currently preparing further guidance to update the 1992 joint circular and to provide authorities with advice on good practice. I hope that that reassures the hon. Lady that we are seeking to deliver in practice what she has suggested.</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's comments. I am aware of some of the actions taken by the Government. Indeed, later this week I shall be going to the Department of Health as a member of an all-party delegation to discuss these issues.<br><br>
I hope that what the Minister has described will happen. Opposition Members have tabled quite a lot of amendments to ensure that these issues are aired, and that we can in future hold the Minister accountable if

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 737</span>
some of the things that he has promised do not happen. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 484, in page 75, line 11, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) The authority shall liaise with the relevant health authority or trust in cases where a person is being discharged from hospital.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment is concerned in a parallel way with liaison between the local housing authority and the relevant health authority about people who are discharged from hospital. Its wording specifies liaison
<br><blockquote><p>"with the relevant health authority or trust".</p></blockquote>
That takes into account the different patterns of organisation that may exist in different areas for people with mental illness.<br><br>
The amendment is predominantly aimed at those with a background of mental illness. When such people are discharged, they require care and support as well as accommodation, and there should be close co-ordination about their welfare between the relevant authorities. Although we all agree that that is right in principle, the worry is that in practice, it does not always happen. There have been too many cases over the years in which people discharged from psychiatric care have not received the necessary support, and their being placed in unsuitable circumstances may have led them to become a risk to themselves or, in some cases, to others. No one wants that to happen. It is clearly good sense and good policy for there to be close co-operation between housing and health authorities in such cases. The amendment would include provision for such co-operation in the Bill.<br><br>
The Minister will no doubt tell us that the matter can be handled in the guidance. Some of us are beginning to worry about the code of guidance, which has grown in size over the years. It is already a substantial document but, on the basis of what we expect following our debates so far, the code of guidance relating to this Bill is likely to be—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice <span class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The size of the Scott report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend says, it could be the size of the Scott report. I hope not, but it is possible.<br><br>
This principle should be in the Bill, with additional information provided in the code of guidance about the opportunities for and practical implications of discharging the duty. Above all, it is important that the duty is discharged. There is some disturbing evidence to suggest that that is not happening to the degree that it should. I am told that a recent evaluation showed that only 42 per cent. of housing authorities had a named contact officer for liaison with the health authority. That is a worrying statistic, as it implies that the level of liaison which should exist in all such cases probably does not exist in a number of instances. Indeed, there is evidence from voluntary organisations that they have too many examples of individuals who have not been assisted in an appropriate way and who have found themselves in a very unfortunate position as a result of lack of sufficient care and support.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 738</span>
For all those reasons, the principle outlined in the amendment should be included in the Bill. We do not dispute that there should be additional guidance, but it should be additional. The amendment would give a necessary emphasis to the importance of close liaison between housing and health authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must be consistent with the remarks that I made on similar amendments. I believe that the code of guidance is the proper place for such a proposal. This is for the health authority to initiate, but I hear the concerns that the hon. Gentleman has expressed. Therefore, I propose to draw the attention of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health to the concerns to ensure that there is a proper interface. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will trust me to undertake that approach to ensure that, in practical terms, what happens is what we want to happen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that offer. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 485, in page 75, line 13, leave out from 'and', to 'inform'.<br><br>
This is a simple amendment which seeks to remove the words.
<br><blockquote><p>"so far as any issue is decided against his interests".</p></blockquote>
That would ensure that an authority informed a person about whom inquiries were being made of any decision—irrespective of the way it went—with regard to its duties under the Bill. As it stands, the Bill puts a duty on an authority to notify people only if a decision has gone against them; there is no need to notify applicants of the reasons for favourable decisions.<br><br>
The object of the amendment is to ensure that people whose situation is reviewed in future are told the reasons for a decision going in their favour. Despite Government new clause 35, which deals with review and will replace clause 152, the Government clearly intend that people towards whom local authorities initially have a duty will have their circumstances considered. Therefore, such people should be able to ascertain the reasons why an authority believes that it has a duty, with which it has to comply, towards those people.<br><br>
If a future review goes against an applicant, he could then compare the two situations and understand why the subsequent review resulted in a different decision. To enable someone to understand the initial reasons why a decision went in his favour so that he can compare it to any later decision is an obvious piece of natural justice.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment and that he will not say that it needs rewording, because all that we seek to do is remove the Government's wording from the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The simple amendments are sometimes the most difficult to understand. A rationale can usually be found for the more complicated ones. The top and bottom of the matter is that I am not sure what problem the hon. Gentleman is trying to solve. If it is a question of information in relation to a future review, I should
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0420">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 739</span>
tell him that such a review would take account of the circumstances at the time of the initial review and the prior decision would not be relevant.<br><br>
I agree that if someone has been refused, he must know the reasons for it and that he has a right to request a review under clause 160. Clause 144 (5) provides for that.<br><br>
Clause 144 (3) requires an authority to give reasons for any negative decision in response to a homelessness application, which is right and proper. It allows the applicant to decide whether to request a review of the decision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point that I was getting at was that if an authority decides that it had a duty under this part of the Bill, for example on eligibility for assistance, an applicant should be able to compare what the authority thought were the changed circumstances which had led it to come to a different view and should know why it had subsequently decided under clause 151 that a person had ceased to be eligible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am still puzzled because the decision, whatever it might be, will be taken by an authority when it conducts the contemporary review. Therefore, I am not attracted by the amendment. Although I cannot accept it, I shall reflect on the hon. Gentleman's points. If I decided that a point is relevant to a future review, I shall see what we can do. However, the hon. Gentleman has failed to persuade me for the moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly disappointed by the Minister's reply, but I acknowledge that he is due for another period of reflection. All the periods of reflection that have been promised in our proceedings add up to a long time. I hope that the Minister approves of the intention of the amendments. It is natural justice that people should be able to understand the reasons for an initial decision, and those for a different decision that may be made later. Individuals should be able to understand why the authority believes that their circumstances have changed. I hope that the Minister will reflect on that.<br><br>
In the interests of proceeding to other important matters, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

PERSONS FROM ABROAD NOT ELIGIBLE FOR SOCIAL ASSISTANCE</div> <!-- title -->

The phrase "persons from abroad", which is resonant of Jane Austen, is like the title of a 20th century novel. However, it confines us to particular legal consideration. It is not clear that the phrase covers returning British nationals and others who have right of residence under the Immigration Act 1971, but fail the habitual residence test. That is why I tabled the amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 740</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought for a moment that my right hon. Friend had in mind the English cricket team, who are returning from the Indian sub-continent. However, I shall not tease him about that.<br><br>
I welcome the opportunity that the amendment gives me to clarify the point raised by my right hon. Friend. We intend to use the powers in clause 145 to align eligibility for assistance under the homelessness legislation with eligibility for housing benefit. Since August 1994, persons failing a habitual residence test have not been eligible for housing benefit. The test, which looks at a person's pattern of settled residence over the last few years, his future intentions, and the focus of his main interests and ties, applies equally to British citizens, European Union citizens, and settled immigrants. The regulation-making power in subsection (2) of the clause is cast in terms that allow it to cover all those groups. I hope that that satisfies my right hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Have I understood the Minister correctly? Will anyone who satisfies the habitual residence test as applied by the local authority housing department meet the eligibility criteria?</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) Nothing in subsection (1) above shall render ineligible under this Part any asylum-seeker.".</p></blockquote></span></p>

<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 378 would amend clause 145, and amendment No. 380 would amend clause 146.<br><br>
Anxiety exists about the way in which the Government deal with asylum seekers. It is felt not only by the Opposition but by many organisations and individuals who are nearer than we are to the problems of asylum seekers. They have expressed their anxieties and concerns about the Government's approach to the question.<br><br>
Amendment No. 378 is designed to exempt asylum seekers from classification under clause 145 as ineligible for social assistance. We are pleading with the Minister and the Government to treat asylum seekers as eligible for social assistance and to ensure that they are entitled to the same rights as the other homeless human beings whom we discussed at length this morning.<br><br>
Amendment No. 380 is designed to delete the last two lines of clause 146(1). Clause 146 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"An asylum-seeker, or a dependant of an asylum-seeker, is not eligible for assistance under this Part if he has any accommodation in the United Kingdom, however temporary, available for his occupation."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0421">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 741</span>
We had a debate this morning on how people could be made homeless and what the Government should consider when people present themselves as homeless. We referred to people who were made homeless in docklands by the tragic events of 9 February. If asylum seekers in temporary accommodation are made homeless by a disaster, is the Minister saying that, under clause 146, there will be no assistance for them? The clause refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"asylum seekers and their dependants",</p></blockquote>
so we are talking about children.<br><br>
If people, through no fault of their own, lose what meagre accommodation they have—whether they are living alone or with other people in a house in multiple occupation—because of a disaster or an act of terrorism, is the Minister saying that they will not be offered accommodation? That is exactly what the clause, as it stands, means. Amendment No. 380 represents an attempt to rescue the Government from that inhuman approach to what could happen. It is not a pious question; it is something that can happen. We want to try to persuade the Minister to see the human side of the problem and to treat asylum seekers and their families with the consideration and the humanity that we would expect from any democratic Government. Amendment No. 380 is important and underlines the anxieties that have been expressed by many people.<br><br>
In amendment No. 378, we are saying that asylum seekers who are in priority need and become homeless either during the period of their initial application or while pursuing any subsequent appeal need the same basic safety net of protection as any other homeless people. There are genuine cases of people who have been seeking asylum in this country who have appeals that may take a considerable time to be heard. We are asking that such people should be considered in the same way as any homeless people. We are not asking for anything unfair, or over and above what has been discussed earlier.<br><br>
The Children Act 1989 and the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 refer to asylum seekers and their dependent children. The children will be vulnerable and should not be faced with homeless-ness while their parents or guardians pursue their rights to stay under asylum laws. Local authorities will continue to have duties under the 1989 and 1990 Acts, so there will be a mixture of responsibilities.<br><br>
Local authorities have responsibilities regardless of the colour or nationality of the children and we have a responsibility to care for those children. The fact that the Bill does not take into account the responsibilities that the Government have set in the 1990 Act heightens our concerns in that area. The Government are being negligent in clause 145.<br><br>
It is highly unfair to exclude vulnerable groups from the safety net of homelessness legislation. If an asylum seeker's family, including children, were burnt out in a fire, or bombed out as in the examples we have heard of terrorism, would the Government seriously say that there would be no assistance for the victims of a disaster beyond their control? I have known the Minister for a considerable time and I think that he could not put his hand on his heart and say that he would not offer
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 742</span>
assistance to such people. If my opinion of the Minister is correct, the amendments must be seriously considered. I want some assurance from him that he will consider the people that I have referred to as he would anyone from his constituency or who was in need of assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If those people lived in temporary accommodation and were eligible as asylum seekers who applied at the port of entry, they would, of course, be rehoused. Generally, there is no assistance for people here on a temporary basis who have a visa which is conditional on their having no recourse to public funds. The measures in the Children Act 1989, cited by the hon. Gentleman, remain in force, but 80 per cent. of asylum seekers do not have children. Mostly, they are single adults.<br><br>
I understand the hon. Gentleman's concern, and I am not without sympathy for his view. However, amendments No. 378 and 380 run counter to what we are seeking to achieve in our policies towards persons from abroad: the alignment of entitlement under the homelessness legislation with entitlement to housing benefit.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman knows that, since February this year, asylum seekers who apply for asylum after entering the country and those remaining here on appeal following an initial refusal of asylum are not entitled to housing benefit. There is no logic in their being entitled to assistance under the homelessness legislation, particularly when the full cost of assisting them would fall to a local authority. We are dealing with people who obtained leave to enter this country on the basis that they would support themselves, or those who entered the country illegally. Only about 5 per cent. of such asylum applications are accepted. Even allowing for exceptional leave granted on compassionate grounds, the refusal rate is still 79 per cent. The success rate on appeal is even lower than 3 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has said that in most cases there are no children involved. May I draw his attention to some recent cases in which there has been a change in the circumstances of a family? Because of that change, a parent has been asked to leave the country with his or her children. Such cases have been highlighted on more than one occasion. Children are involved. The Minister should consider that point and not be led by his brief to say that no children will be involved in the cases that I described.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that children were not involved, but the overwhelming majority of asylum seekers do not have children. Of course, I accept that there are cases in which children are involved, but the cases that the hon. Gentleman has described do not fall to my Department to decide.<br><br>
I must tell the Committee that people who apply for asylum at the port of entry will continue to be eligible for housing assistance and housing benefit until a decision has been made on their cases. I am afraid that I must resist the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise only to draw attention to circumstances in which people will be severely penalized
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0422">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 743</span>
as a result of the new arrangements, which, I accept entirely, are being introduced to bring the policy in the Minister's area of responsibility into line with that being adopted in other Government Departments. I suspect that the Minister is not the source of these measures, but that he is simply being told what to do.<br><br>
I wish to highlight the circumstances of a constituent who arrived in this country not long ago, and fortunately for him before the operative date in February when the new regulations came into effect. He arrived from Iraq where he had been tortured. He had had the horrendous experience of a close friend being killed by the Iraqi authorities, and he himself had suffered grievous injuries and could walk only with considerable difficulty. When he was told that he was likely to be arrested again and that might be killed, he fled the country in a great hurry and arrived in the United Kingdom late on a Friday evening to be met by friends. Not being able to speak any English at all, he explained that he had come to stay with his friends and he did not make his application for asylum until the following Monday.<br><br>
Because of the new regulations that have been introduced, such a person, who is the type of genuine asylum seeker that no one in the House could possibly want to penalise, would be denied entitlement to accommodation if homeless. Such a person would be denied entitlement to benefit and would be deemed, according to the ludicrous regulations that the Government are now putting into effect, to be a bogus rather than a genuine asylum seeker. That is because he did not make an application at the port or time of entry.<br><br>
No one with any sense of humanity can justify or condone the Government's policies and no one with any sense of humanity can say that someone in that position should be denied housing. An injustice is taking place. We accept that the Minister is not personally responsible for the policy, but he is going along with the injustice. To that extent, he must be held responsible. We deplore the Government's failure to accept the amendment. I invite my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton to press it to a Division.</span></p>
<p>6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Normanton spoke of people who knew rather more than we did. I find that difficult to accept because my hon. Friend probably knows more about housing and homelessness than the combined Committee. He referred specifically to asylum seekers and homelessness.<br><br>
The Refugee Council is already tracking more than 100 asylum seekers who are homeless. It has been established that 90 per cent. of them tend to gravitate to London and its boroughs. My local authority, Camden, estimates that if it is responsible under the Housing Act 1988 and the Children and Young Persons Act 1991, the additional cost to the council will be in excess of £4.6 million.<br><br>
I remind the Minister that some refugee children are in this country unaccompanied.</span></p>

<p><i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was drawing the Minister's attention to the fact that unaccompanied children may be involved and I shall refer to two cases in my constituency. Two brothers aged 12 and 14 were sent unaccompanied to this country from Bosnia, and a young girl of 15 arrived unaccompanied from Ethiopia. It is possible that they may find themselves homeless with no financial support. The Opposition are concerned not with illegal asylum seekers—although we could argue about the Government's definition of what constitutes an illegal asylum seeker and whether that is acceptable to us—but people who have made a claim for asylum in this country and who are waiting for their appeals to be heard.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich referred to a case in his constituency and I have a similar one in my constituency, although the applicant has been here somewhat longer. The appeal procedure is very long and in many instances it is the fault of no one, but it is wrong that those who must bear the greatest burden are those who are seeking protection and sanctuary in this country. The constituent to whom I most recently referred had endured appalling torture in his own country. Although he can now walk, in many ways he will be crippled for life. Such cases are causing genuine concern in the House, and outside it. There seems to be a total community of feeling which crosses all social, political and economic boundaries. That is certainly so in my constituency.<br><br>
We acknowledge that the Minister is not responsible for the bedrock of this iniquitous legislation, but, before he dismisses the amendment out of hand, we ask him again to consider the human tragedies that we are discussing and which will be exacerbated by the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed with the Minister's response. Most people in Greater Manchester are appalled by the Government's attitude to asylum seekers. Greater Manchester has a long tradition of welcoming people from oppression and, having made them welcome, benefiting from them. The large firms that were founded in Greater Manchester over the past 100 years include names such as Whitworth, Beyer and Peacock. Whit-worth and Beyer were refugees from Germany who came with considerable skills and after a short period of assimilation made a tremendous contribution to this country. Another example, which is perhaps not such a good one to quote to the Government, is Engels, who came to Manchester following persecution and made a tremendous intellectual contribution.<br><br>
More recently, people from Europe, particularly just before the second world war, were made very welcome in Manchester and were looked after. In 1956, people from Hungary came to this country in all sorts of ways—they did not apply formally for asylum, but simply managed to come here. They were looked after by people in Manchester, often for quite long periods, and those who were looking after them provided the fi-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0423">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 745</span>
nance. The same happened following the problems in Chile and, again, people came to this country as visitors and were on the whole looked after by ordinary people in areas such as Manchester. More recently, following oppression in other places, people have been made welcome.<br><br>
I understand the Government's argument that such people should not be a charge on public funds and, reluctantly, I can accept that argument. What I cannot accept is that the Minister is now saying that if someone in an area such as greater Manchester puts up or looks after someone who has initially come to this country because of persecution and who has to apply for asylum while he is here, and that person is living in a household that if for some reason made homeless, the local authority will not be entitled to assist the person who is here as a refugee.<br><br>
People who put other people up in such circumstances often experience overcrowding and all sorts of other pressures. It would be very unfair on such people if, when their house burnt down or was flooded, or when something similar happened, they not only had the problem of being rehoused temporarily themselves by the local authority—a pretty traumatic experience—but the people they had been looking after could not be rehoused by the local authority, and some other arrangement had to be made for them.<br><br>
I should have thought that the Government could say that if people who were here and had made their own arrangements, or had arrangements made by someone else, were overtaken by disaster and became homeless, they would be given assistance under the Bill. The Government are retreating a long way from the traditions of liberal concern that have been expressed in this country over the centuries. They are now saying that someone who has someone who has been persecuted in his own country, who has come here and been looked after not by public funds but by well-wishers, and who is overtaken by a further disaster, cannot be helped by a local authority. That is very sad, and I should have thought that, at least in this small way, the Government could have shown a little more sympathy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that the Minister did not encourage us more by giving us some assurances. It is indeed sad to realise that no assistance will be given to people in need, and I shall press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>

The amendment is intended to ensure that those people who are ineligible for social assistance—or housing assistance, as we must now call it—are not disregarded in any assessment of the housing needs of the household. We believe that the housing needs of the entire household should be taken into account in an assessment of the size and condition of the accommodation required.<br><br>
For example, if families who have come from abroad, who are resident in this country and have residency rights, include persons who may not be eligible for housing assistance, those persons should be taken into account when the housing assessment is made.<br><br>

If a British citizen who is in priority need makes an application, and that citizen has dependants who are ineligible, the authority will need to consider the suitability of the accommodation in the context of the size of the whole household.

<br><blockquote><p>'which it would be reasonable for him to occupy'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These amendments go together; their purpose is to reinstate the wording of section 4 of the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993, so that accommodation must be reasonable for a person to continue to occupy. The amendments would ensure that asylum seekers are treated as homeless unless they have accommodation which it is reasonable to continue to occupy. We have touched on that matter already this afternoon.<br><br>
The Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993 amended part III of the Housing Act 1985 to restrict the duties owed to asylum seekers in the provision of temporary accommodation until their asylum status has been determined. In addition, the temporary accommodation duty arises only when the applicant has no accommodation, however temporary, that it would be reasonable for him to occupy.<br><br>
The Bill proposes to remove all access to emergency assistance to asylum seekers who apply for asylum here and to those appealing against a negative decision on their asylum applications. The provisions of clause 146 will therefore apply only to a minority of asylum seekers. Some of us have other views about the provisions of asylum legislation, but it is important to emphasise that only a minority of asylum seekers will be affected, mainly those who apply for asylum at the port of entry.<br><br>
During debates on the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993, the Government gave repeated assurances that the words "however temporary" were not intended to force asylum seekers to live in church halls or other places that would be unpleasant or prejudicial to health. Similar standards of reasonableness were intended to apply to accommodation for the homeless. The Bill has dropped the qualification that accommodation, however temporary, should be reasonable to occupy.<br><br>
Subsection (4) of clause 137 defines accommodation available for occupation. It is therefore arguable that that definition should also apply to accommodation available to asylum seekers. However, clause 138 allows the Secretary of State to issue regulations covering
<br><blockquote><p>"other matters to be taken into account or disregarded in determining whether it would be… reasonable… to continue to occupy".</p></blockquote>
It is unclear what those other matters may be and quite possible that such regulations could be used to exclude asylum seekers and their families from the test of reasonableness.<br><br>
The implications for many asylum seekers are grave. On arrival in the United Kingdom, asylum seekers are found emergency accommodation, often in assembly halls, provided by churches and other groups. Most such places have large, open rooms, and are often shared by two or more families. The code of guidance on homelessness states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Such accommodation would not be accommodation reasonable for a family to occupy".</p></blockquote>
However, without the qualification that the accommodation should be reasonable to occupy, asylum seekers are likely to be considered not homeless if they live in such accommodation. The Government would effec-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 748</span>
tively be stating that what was considered unreasonable accommodation a few years ago may now be suitable for asylum seekers.<br><br>
Quite apart from the physical and mental stress that such a change could cause, the valuable work carried out by many voluntary organisations in providing emergency accommodation would be seriously undermined. I hope that the Minister will agree that it is not reasonable to have different definitions of reasonableness for homeless people and for asylum seekers. I hope that he will look favourably on the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993 provides that an asylum seeker is owed a duty under the homelessness legislation only if there is no other accommodation for him to occupy. That reflects the fact that, for as long as his application for asylum is unresolved, that person is in this country only temporarily and does not need the more settled accommodation provided for in the main duty under the Housing Act 1985 or the new two-year duty. The amendments would set that provision aside.<br><br>
The homelessness code of guidance makes it clear how authorities should discharge their duties to asylum seekers. It states, inter alia, that the accommodation he is occupying must be suitable for his needs. For the limited time during which his application is being considered—we hope to reduce that time in the Asylum and Immigration Bill presently being considered in another place—he is adequately catered for. Once his application is determined, and he is given either refugee status or indefinite leave to remain, he will then be entitled to the same benefits as anyone else who is eligible for assistance. The accommodation may be temporary, but it must also be reasonable by virtue of the provisions of clause 137. Subsection (4) provides that definition of reasonableness, although not in the same clause as the main asylum seeker provisions. There is no change in that definition. I must resist the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister is reassuring us that there is no difference between the standard of reasonable accommodation for homeless people and that for asylum seekers, in which case I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

INTERIM DUTY TO ACCOMMODATE IN CASE OF APPARENT PRIORITY NEED</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 489, in page 76, line 43, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) The duty to an applicant under subsection (1) shall be met at all times of the day or night.".</p></blockquote>
Clause 147 covers the interim duty on a local authority to provide accommodation for homeless people while inquiries are taking place and before the authority reaches its decision. The amendment would ensure that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0425">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 749</span>
that duty bites at all times of the day and night. Clearly, that is important if someone becomes homeless late at night, outside normal office hours. If the person were without assistance in such an emergency, he or she would literally be left on the streets overnight. It is good practice to ensure emergency cover and most authorities try to ensure that such cover is provided. Unfortunately, some fail, and we have been given some rather distressing examples of people who have found themselves homeless late at night and the local authority has said that no service can be provided until the following morning.<br><br>
That is unacceptable. Proper homelessness cover must be 24-hour cover and our amendment would provide that. I have many examples that I could quote, but I shall not. All the voluntary organisations, especially Shelter, which runs an extremely effective night line, know the need for expert advice and assistance for those who become homeless in an emergency. The circumstances of that are obvious, such as in cases of domestic violence. A row may have taken place at night and the mother and children have had to leave in a hurry. They need immediate help and assistance and it is unacceptable for them to be told by their local authority that nothing can be done until the following morning.<br><br>
The amendment does not require local authorities to keep expert staff on duty in the office throughout the night. All it requires is the provision of an emergency service which, if contacted, will ensure that provision is made for overnight accommodation. A 24-hour contact point with access to a duty specialist who can ensure that arrangements are made is all that is required. It would not impose an unreasonable burden on local authorities, but would ensure that the proposed legislation is properly effected in every local authority area. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the intention behind the amendment. The homelessness code of guidance makes it clear that authorities should aim to provide 24-hour emergency cover. The recent study from the Department "An evaluation of the homeless code of guidance" reports that 93 per cent. of authorities provide 24-hour cover. As the hon. Member for Greenwich conceded, it is not necessarily provided by housing officers. In some cases, it is provided by social services. As the hon. Gentleman said, a woman ejected by a violent partner in the middle of the night must have somewhere to turn and that should result in immediate overnight accommodation being provided.<br><br>
The apparent absence of cover in the other 7 per cent. of cases is unsatisfactory. I shall consider strengthening the guidance on that point and evidence might lead instead to a review in practice. I must emphasise that the clear implication under current legislaition and the Bill is that the interim duty under clause 147 applies at all times. The amendment is covered by the Bill. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it and I assure him that I take on board his comments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his positive response. Obviously, we would have preferred such a duty to be in the Bill. However, in the light of his
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 750</span>
comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 490, in page 77, leave out lines 1 to 5 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(3) The authority shall continue to secure that accommodation is available for the applicant's occupation pending a decision on a review.".</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Government will reflect on what I consider to be an inadequacy in the Bill. For example, an authority may continue to secure accommodation while it considers the longer term duties that it may have to an applicant if it initially turns down the applicant's case and the applicant asks for it to be reviewed. Under the amendment, the authority would have a responsibility to continue to provide interim accommodation while a review was being dealt with.<br><br>
The problem with the Bill is that an applicant could be in the most desperate circumstances. The review might establish that the local authority's initial decision was wrong. People could be homeless, eligible for assistance and in priority need and, thus, meet all the conditions under the Bill. They could be vulnerable, young, elderly or have mental health difficulties and yet be affected by the decision that might be overturned subsequently.<br><br>
While the review is taking place, the authority has no responsibility to do anything other than show people the door and tell them to find accommodation for themselves. Surely it cannot be right that the local authority has no responsibility for a handful of people who are in real difficulties. I am talking not about a long-term responsibility but about a short-term arrangement while the authority establishes whether it has a longer-term duty towards a homeless person or family.<br><br>
One argument against continuing to provide interim accommodation while a review is taking place is that it could encourage more people to apply for a review. I accept that that is a possibility. However, if no obligation is placed on the authority to provide accommodation, that could encourage it to draw out the review so that people became desperate and disappeared from the scene because they were not receiving real assistance with their housing problems.<br><br>
If an authority had an obligation to continue providing interim accommodation when a review had been asked for and had been undertaken, it would give it an incentive to deal with the review expeditiously. The Bill does not mention a period in which the review must be undertaken. As a result, an individual who has a real case and who eventually wins a review could spend weeks while the review was being undertaken fending for himself. I am talking about homeless, vulnerable people who are in priority need. It is not acceptable that such people have no one to take responsibility for them and I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the papers requesting a review show that there may be a strong, arguable case, the authority can continue to provide accommodation. Local authorities are generally assiduous about the way in which they assess an application for assistance under the legis-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0426">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 751</span>
lation. We see the new review procedure as an important safeguard of the rights of the applicant and want it to be as open as possible, so that the aggrieved applicant can have access to it without specialist or professional help. We want authorities to conduct reviews as speedily as possible, and we will issue guidance on the target times that they might wish to set themselves for the turn-around of appeals, although in many cases it will be several weeks before than can be arranged.<br><br>
Nevertheless, given those circumstances, amendment No. 490 could be an invitation to people who had been refused assistance to put in an appeal with the objective of requiring the authority to provide further accommodation. I would prefer to follow the model that is applied to social security appeals, in which entitlement to benefits is withheld pending the outcome of an appeal that has been made against a decision to suspend benefits.<br><br>
As I said, the authority has a discretion to continue to provide interim accommodation where it considers that sensible, and I prefer to rest on that provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the Minister and I am disappointed in his response. He has said that where an authority examines the papers and thinks that there may be an arguable case for review, it may continue to secure the accommodation. In other words, the Minister accepts that even though there might be a good case for a review, the authority could still turn the person out onto the street. That would be an acceptable action for the authority to take under the Bill. That cannot be acceptable. I am sorry that the Minister has chosen to take such a hard line on the matter and I shall press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 491, in page 77, line 6, leave out subsection (4).<br><br>
This is the first time that we will consider the impact of clause 155 and the way in which its tentacles spread through this part of the Bill. For the unwary—many homeless people can be regarded as unwary when they come to consider how the Bill will affect them—the measure is a man trap, or perhaps we should call it a person trap in the new parlance. There will be a major obstacle to the local authority's ability to do anything
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 752</span>
for homeless people as clause 155 begins to affect duties and responsibilities in all parts of the Bill.<br><br>
Clause 155 will affect even the interim duty to secure accommodation for people while their circumstances are investigated and assessments are carried out to establish priority need, vulnerability and intentionality. That process can take time, and the authority's responsibility to provide interim accommodation may be undermined if it can turn round and say, under clause 155, "We believe that there is other suitable accommodation available for you in the district—go away and find it. Here is a list of landlords who offer rented accommodation. We have now fulfilled our responsibilities, and do not need to do anything else."<br><br>
Clause 147(4) states the clause
<br><blockquote><p>"has effect subject to section 155".</p></blockquote>
Can an authority effectively avoid any duty that it has under the Bill by virtue of the fact that it does not itself need to provide interim accommodation for a family or a person? Could it simply say, "There is other suitable accommodation available in the district"? That is how I read the clause. The interim duty seems to place no further responsibilities on authorities. Authorities do not seem to have a duty to carry on with any other investigations that they would otherwise have conducted under other provisions of the Bill. Clause 155 removes those responsibilities from the authority.<br><br>
The Minister may convince me that the clause will not have that effect: he might say that an authority will have to consider priority need under the provision of clause 148, intentionality under the provision of clause 151 and other matters before it reaches a final view of its duty. In the interim, however, it might simply give an individual a list of landlords
Clause 155 does not require authorities to find a person accommodation in a particular property; it simply requires the authority to ensure that accommodation is generally available in its area. Many of those who need interim accommodation are vulnerable people. Information that has been compiled, shows that 29 per cent. of people in priority need are so categorised because they are considered to be vulnerable. Those people will be sent out to find accommodation for themselves, which is simply not acceptable. People appear on a local authority's doorstep because they have major problems finding accommodation for themselves, perhaps because of their circumstances. The young, the elderly and those with mental health problems may be sent out to find accommodation in the private sector. The authority will not find it for them; it will not say, "This is what we have found; here is a guarantee of accommodation." Vulnerable people will be sent out with a list to fend for themselves.<br><br>
Case law on the subject has defined people who are vulnerable as those who are less able to fend for themselves, so that injury or detriment may result. A less vulnerable person would have been able to cope with a similar situation. That implies that many vulnerable people face the possibility of suffering damage or injury. That is why the courts classify them as being vulnerable.<br><br>
It is a horrific possibility that all further responsibilities and duties that authorities have to homeless people may be removed by the clause. If the problem applies
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0427">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 753</span>
only with regard to the interim duty to house, it still means that vulnerable people of priority need will be sent out to find suitable accommodation that the local authority believes is available in its area while that authority establishes its longer-term duties. That is unacceptable.<br><br>
The Minister might respond, "Of course an authority has to do more than that. It has to ensure that that accommodation is available and that vulnerable people are housed satisfactorily." Why waste authorities' time doing that when they should be getting on with their assessments of people's needs and of the duties that they have towards those people? They should also assess priority needs and intentionality. If authorities become obsessed with going out into the private sector seeking properties for individuals, that will detract from their real responsibility to ensure that the interim period is as short as possible and that the longer-term duty is established. I hope that the Government accept the amendment, because otherwise there is a danger that all the other duties and responsibilities in this part of the Bill will be undermined.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would disapply the alternative accommodation provision in respect of the interim duty to accommodate pending inquiries. I do not understand the logic in requiring an authority to provide its own accommodation for someone if there is a ready supply available in the private sector. The alternative accommodation provision, which we shall debate in more detail later, is a halfway stage between the purely advisory role of authorities and the full homelessness duty. It requires an individual to take some responsibility for arranging his own accommodation, but it also requires the authority to be confident that accommodation is available and to give the individual the requisite support. Handing out a list of advertisements from the local newspaper will not be sufficient to meet the requirements of the legislation. I therefore resist the amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 754</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's response is completely unsatisfactory. A vulnerable young person who may, for example, be caught up in a prostitution ring, could be sent out to fend for themselves. The clause puts no responsibility on an authority towards even the most vulnerable with the highest priority of need. No caveat or criterion is laid down. The clause merely says that any person in that situation can—indeed, must—be sent out by an authority if there is suitable accommodation. The authority has no choice. If there is suitable accommodation in the private sector, an individual, however vulnerable, must be sent out to fend for themselves. That is not satisfactory. I should like to divide the Committee on the amendment.</span></p>
