	<p>[MRS. ANN WINTERTON 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Housing Bill</h1></div>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Winterton. I had hoped that a new selection list would be available this afternoon. It has been my experience of Committees over the years that, when an amendment is starred in the morning sitting, the star is removed when the matter comes up for discussion in the afternoon sitting and the Chairman can select the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I handed in my amendment last night, I checked that it would be starred for this morning's sitting and that it would be available for selection in later proceedings. I was assured that whether you selected the amendment, Mrs. Winterton, was purely a matter for you, but the fact that it was handed in last night, not on Friday, would not prejudice its selection. Will you consider accepting amendment No. 146 for debate? If not, I hope that you will agree that it would be appropriate to refer to it in the clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should explain to the hon. Gentleman and the Committee that my joint Chairman, Mr. McWilliam, who spoke for both of us, said at the Committee's first sitting that it would not be our usual practice to select starred amendments. I see no reason to depart from that at this stage, but it might be of comfort to the hon. Gentleman to suggest that he may briefly raise the issue in the clause stand part debate later this afternoon or return to it during later stages of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mrs. Winterton. As I understand the rules, the starring comes off at lunch time. That is the fundamental issue, and during the 20 years that I have been a Member of Parliament, it has always been the practice for a new selection list to be issued in the afternoon sitting to take into account the fact that starring has been removed. If that does not apply, it puts those hon. Members who represent constituencies outside London and cannot table amendments in the House on Fridays at a particular disadvantage. It has always been the case that, if an amendment was starred at one sitting, its star is removed at the next sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for such procedure is simple. If hon. Members do not like the non-acceptance of a starred amendment, they can keep the sitting going to ensure that the amendment is not reached until the following sitting. That would not be in keeping with the spirit of this Committee, but such a tactic is available. On this occasion, however, I am happy that I can refer to the amendment in the clause stand part debate. I hope that you will look into the matter, Mrs. Winterton, and stick to the precedent that has been set in the House by which starring is removed at lunch time if the Committee is sitting twice in the same day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reassure the hon. Gentleman. What he described is not my understanding of the situation. However, I will, of course, review it and return with a firm ruling at the Committee's next sitting. I hope that that will satisfy him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We may return to the subject of the amendment again. Indeed, I should like to amend all similar parts of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gyles Brandreth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of Chester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Winterton. It is probably entirely my fault, but I counted 12 Noes, not 13, in the previous Division. Given the connotations of fortune associated with that number, it may be important—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I apologise, Mrs. Winterton. The Liberal Democrats were with us.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends in the Liberal Democrat party and I—as well as other hon. Members—are worried that so much legislation is made by regulation rather than in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0072">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
Bills. Amendment No. 124 seeks that regulations must be considered and passed by both Houses of Parliament—either by Committee or by the whole House. We should not need to pray against such delegated legislation. It should also be possible for interested parties to have the chance to respond to regulations made under clause 16. I would like to make that change to other parts of the Bill, but I content myself today with the one amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One worrying aspect of the Bill is that it gives huge powers to the Secretary of State. I am pleased that the Under-Secretary has just voted down one such power; perhaps he will curb the powers a little more. Statutory instruments are hugely overused. We are giving detailed consideration to the right to buy of housing association tenants. Any changes made to our decisions on that subject should also receive detailed consideration. The matter is particularly controversial and there has been some cross-party agreement about some of our worries on that matter. It would be a mammoth task to replace each order proposed under the Bill, but I hope to ensure at least some debate on the more important matters by making more regulations subject to the affirmative procedure, rather than having to be prayed against. It is extremely important that interested parties should have an opportunity to object. The Under-Secretary may claim that the amendment does nothing—in which case, why object to it? I hope that he will follow the Minister's lead and be more accommodating on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. James Clappison)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I cannot be as accommodating as the hon. Lady would like. The amendment must be read in the context of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 16 allows the Secretary of State by order to designate rural areas where the new right will not apply, specify the discount that will apply and, by regulations, amend part V of Housing Act 1985 as it applies to the new right. This morning, we had a fairly lengthy debate, which covered much of that ground. The Committee has now received detailed proposals on how we intend to designate exempt rural settlements—proposals on which we will consult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For discounts, we propose to follow the amounts already available under the successful tenants incentive scheme, which helps tenants to buy in the private sector. Regulations amending part V of the Housing Act 1985 will provide much of the detail about how the new right will work, such as eligibility procedures and exemptions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The major departures that we propose are already included in the Bill. As the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock) mentioned, clause 16 provides that orders and regulations be made subject to the negative procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where is the discount mentioned in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 16(1)(a) mentions the power to
	<br><blockquote><p>"specify the amount or rate of discount to be given".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman will know that that is to be set out in regulations that will follow. He will also know that the tenants incentive scheme, to which I referred, provides for discounts in the range of £8,000 to £16,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that I cannot be as accommodating about the amendment as the hon. Member for Christchurch would like. As she will realise, we have debated the principles that will govern exemptions—principles that we have set out fully. In those circumstances, it would not be appropriate to have to use the affirmative procedure every time that there was an alteration. The negative procedure allows for further debate, if an hon. Member prays against a statutory instrument when it is brought before the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's explanation. Will he at least assure the Committee that no statutory instrument will be tabled during parliamentary recesses? Increasingly, Ministers table statutory instruments in a recess which gives hon. Members little opportunity to follow them up. If that procedure is to be used, can the Minister at least undertake that it will be used only when the House is sitting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will know that the procedure for praying against an instrument is flexible and allows hon. Members to do so when they want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I know that hon. Members have an opportunity to pray against statutory instruments during recesses. The point is that hon. Members are often in far-flung constituencies at that time. That enables Ministers to table statutory instruments that hon. Members do not necessarily have the opportunity to read at first hand. Will the Minister at least agree not to use the procedure in recesses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that there is a delay that relates purely to days on which the House is sitting, which I think deals with his point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 124 also proposes that, before any subsequent variations were made to orders and regulations, the Secretary of State would be required to accept representations from anyone who might be affected by the change. Of course, if major changes to orders or regulations were proposed, we would consult those affected, but some changes would be too small or technical to merit them requiring representations. For example, representations would be required if minor changes were needed to the amounts of discount to keep in step with the tenants incentive scheme. In some circumstances, the amendment might bind the Government to a very wide consultation, which could be unnecessarily bureaucratic and time consuming. I am sure that the hon. Member for Christchurch would want to avoid that eventuality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister include changes to the rent-to-mortgage terms as described in clause 16 among the possible changes to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0073">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
regulations that might be so small as to make it not worth while consulting on them, as so few people would be interested?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, the hon. Gentleman has made his point, but I think that he will accept my general argument that it is not a good use of time to consult on minor and technical changes, and that Governments will want to consult appropriate bodies about major changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot be accommodating to the hon. Lady and I resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support the amendment, although I should have preferred to do so only in so far as it affects the operation of clause 16(1)(a) and to leave matters affecting the operation of clause 16(1)(b) for clause stand part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another typical example of the Government's methods of abusing parliamentary procedures has been presented to us. The Renton Committee laid out clearly the principles for legislation—that the principles of a measure should be within the Act of Parliament and that only minor variations from it should be in regulations. Substantial and important variations, such as taxation powers, should be subject to affirmative orders and only relatively minor issues should be subject to the negative procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 16(1)(a) deals with the rate at which the discount can be paid. That is a substantial matter. It may need to be varied, although if it is a percentage it will not need to be varied for inflation. Therefore, Parliament should have control over it and it should be subject to an affirmative resolution of the House. If such an order is subject to affirmative resolution of the House, it comes into operation on a specific day, after approval by the House. As soon as one wanders into areas of negative resolution—apart from the fact that considerable power has been withdrawn from the House, as the measure must be prayed against—confusion arises about when the order comes into force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that the Government laid the relevant order in June. A prayer against it might follow, but because of the way in which the House works in the approach to a recess, it would be unlikely to deal with it in June. The 40-day period would run until the start of the recess and be carried over to October, so no difficulty would arise over holding the debate and it is just possible, although not likely, that the Government would be defeated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government were defeated, deciding when the new amount of money was to be paid would become a nightmare. It would depend on the starting date in the order. If the Government had displayed foresight—perhaps the Minister could give the Committee an undertaking in that regard—the commencement date would be after the expiry of the 40 days. However, that is a complicated arrangement. Let us suppose that it were tried this summer; we might assume that the 40 days would run well into November. However, a general election is approaching and all kinds of problems could affect the order. In presenting a measure that deals with money, it is greatly advantageous to specify a date for it to take effect—the date on which the measure is approved by the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
It is not good enough to keep on framing measures as negative orders that it is impossible for hon. Members, to amend. It is difficult to keep track of the time-limits affecting the orders. Such methods remove the power of the House of Commons to scrutinise the Executive. Perhaps the Government like it that way, but I must warn the Minister that Ministers come and go. It would be perfectly possible, as I understand the construction of the measure, for a Minister—perhaps of a different party from that of the present Minister—to decide on a substantial change in the rate of discount. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that would be all right, then that is all very well. If that is so, however, instead of struggling through Bills that contain amazing detail, clause by clause, we might as well adopt a regulation to allow the Secretary of State to do as he wants with respect to housing, subject to regulations. He could use negative orders and do this, that and the other. There are people who would say that that is a much more efficient way for a party that has just won a general election to get things done, but it is totally against the spirit of parliamentary scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should turn to the affirmative procedure to deal with the first part of the clause, because the Government have nothing to fear. If they are doing something of which everyone approves, affirmative orders can slide through the House remarkably quickly and without any problem. But if the Government are doing something controversial, everyone should have the right to debate it properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, even at this stage, that the Minister will have another look at the matter and consider amending clause 16(1)(a) on Report to make it subject to the affirmative procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I can be no more obliging to the hon. Gentleman. I listened with interest to the view that he put forward. He has the benefit of experience in such matters and his points will have wider application than those that he has made with regard to other contexts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I respectfully draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to this context. We are discussing houses that have yet to be built and which will be the result of future receipts of housing grant. In those circumstances, his general point does not have particular application to the clause. He knows that there are opportunities for hon. Members to pray against resolutions and that, if statutory instruments are tabled during a recess, hon. Members can pray against them when the House reassembles. The hon. Gentleman's points do not perhaps carry as much force in this context as they might in others. I cannot be obliging to him on this occcasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not convinced by the Minister's arguments, but there is a difference of opinion between myself and the Government on how negative prayers are used. I am worried that we are taking away Parliament's powers of scrutiny. I am grateful for the support of the hon. Members for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) and for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett). The hon. Members for Denton and Reddish has much more experience of the House than I, and he eloquently gave the reasons—I outlined them briefly—why we are so opposed to such a method

being used. It was interesting to hear what would happen should we have a change of Government. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will still be batting on the same side then. I wish to push the amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to express considerable concern about clause 16(1)(b). The Government have made a mess of the Bill. They give the usual excuse of not being able to get on with things when a difficulty arises, but say that such a difficulty can be cleared up when the regulations are laid, which is often months later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have a choice. Are these rural designations fixed and permanent, or are they flexible? I do not know the Government's thinking in that respect. If the designations are fixed and permanent and will not be varied by Ministers from time to time, the provisions that relate to them should be contained in a schedule to the Bill. The Renton report on legislation clearly states that, when detail concerning a Bill is fixed, it should be put in the schedule. The Government have not put such provisions in a schedule, because they have not worked out the detail. They are busy with the consultation process. Will the Minister say whether this is the case? Do the Government intend to add a schedule to the Bill at a later stage? If such designations are intended to be permanent, they should be contained in a schedule, not a statutory instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have an appalling record on statutory instruments. They say proudly that they are a deregulation Government. Yet in 1986, they introduced about 2,300 regulations a year. That figure has now increased to 3,300—that is 1,000 extra regulations introduced every year. How many regulations does the Minister expect to make in this area? That is a crucial question. Even one regulation per county works out at quite a few. If, however, all the regulations are together in one set—as far as I can see from the advisory notes that the hon. Gentleman helpfully circulated—that will make it a pretty thick document. It will also be pretty pricey, but people will have to buy it to find out from the map where their property lies and whether it falls
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
inside or outside the boundaries. I shall be interested to hear how many regulations will result from having such a power in the Bill. In any event, the number of regulations that the Government have made is a scandal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be extremely difficult for Members of Parliament, because if the regulations are made county by county, there might be a dozen or more prayers. The usual channels, especially the Whips, are not that enthusiastic about setting up Committees to debate such orders. The boundaries will, of course, affect only very few people. I thought that the Government were concerned about the individual; I should have thought that the rights of individuals and the way in which they would be affected by the boundaries were extremely important. Individuals should be able to have a say when the boundaries substantially affect their financial position. In that respect, use of the negative procedure is not very satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the regulations are to be fixed, they should be in a schedule. If they are to be variable, the Government should consider another procedure, under which people can make representations that have a bit more meaning than getting hold of their Member of Parliament and asking for a prayer to be made so that a regulation can be annulled. People will not be interested in having regulations annulled because they will be happy with 95 per cent. or more of an order. People will be unhappy when their house falls on one side or another of a boundary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government want flexible regulations, they should consider a flexible procedure. I have outlined such a procedure in my starred amendment and suggested that some form of public inquiry could deal with these matters. The Government should set up a process of public consultation, so that the provisions are not set out in regulations. If the Government had a proper inquiry process, which should be simple, there would be no point in having regulations. At the end of that process, the Secretary of State should put an application into place in the same way that he would put a planning application into place. The Secretary of State would not use Parliament, but he would use a tried and tested planning process to decide whether his proposals are weak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I plead with the Minister to reconsider subsection (1)(b) of the clause. He must decide whether the regulations are to be permanent and fixed, in which case they should be in the schedule, or whether they are to be variable and subject to lobbying and other processes. Those processes should be effective and semi-judicial in the same way that planning applications are. At least, people would have the opportunity to present their case as to why a property, or land that they have donated for the building of properties, should be inside or outside the boundary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister appreciates that there are problems with the designation and will assure us that he will take another look at it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I draw the Minister's attention to an issue that I raised lightheartedly in an intervention. Clause 16(3)(c) refers to cases in which rent-to-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0075">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
mortgage terms will not apply, if the Secretary of State so decides. The Government attached great importance to the rent-to-mortgage scheme. It was one of the shining lights in their election manifesto, which described how poorer tenants, who could not afford the fairly generous terms under the right to buy, could nevertheless throw off the yoke of their oppressive local authority landlord and eventually own their home under the rent-to-mortgage scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the information that Ministers have subsequently been forced to reveal, we have become aware that the take-up under that scheme has been little short of a disaster. Only 13 successful applications have been made, but the cost of advertising the scheme to potential purchasers has cost £140,000 of taxpayers money. Despite that, the scheme is still Government policy and they have defended and not retracted it. We warned them earlier and subsequent failures have come to light, but the Government have never suggested that the policy was wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, Ministers told us on numerous occasions that the clause was aimed at giving the tenants of social rented housing the same advantages and rights as those enjoyed by tenants of local authority housing. Ministers have repeated that principle time and again. If the rent-to-mortgage scheme is still Government policy and the Government believe that tenants of social rented housing should have the same rights, why does clause 16(3)(c) raise the possibility that the rent-to-mortgage scheme will not apply to tenants of social rented housing should the Secretary of State so decide? Are the Government finally admitting that that scheme has failed, or that it will not be a potential success for tenants of social rented housing? We do not expect an apology from the Government, but we expect some recognition that the scheme has been an abject failure, and has been so ham-fistedly handled for local authority tenants, that they have no desire to replicate that failure for these properties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond briefly to the points made by the hon. Members for Denton and Reddish and for Attercliffe. The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish made a point about statutory instruments. He may be aware that we had a fairly full debate on the general subject of rural exemptions this morning. One of the themes that emerged in that debate was the need for the system to be fair and comprehensive. We feel that the framework that we will put in place through clause 16 and the powers to make regulations under that clause will produce a fair and comprehensive system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of what the hon. Gentleman said, particularly his points about the individual concerns that residents may have about the application of the scheme, is dealt with by our plans for consultation. We intend to carry out a detailed consultation on that matter and, when we consult, we will ensure that all local authorities and local housing officers know what are our plans for their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Denton & Reddish asked how many statutory instruments there would be. I can tell him that there will be one statutory instrument, which will cover the whole country. It will be, by its nature, a large document but, as my hon. Friend the Minister explained this morning, that is the only way of ensuring
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
a fair and comprehensive scheme, which we consider important. The system that we will put in place, and the use of the statutory instrument procedure, is a fair method of dealing with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Attercliffe was keen to revisit the subject of rents to mortgages. He has had two bites at that subject and he is anxious to get to his feet and mention it again. I invite him to consider that, notwithstanding his comments about rents to mortgages, the Government have had some success in diversifying ownership, and particularly in giving rights to tenants. He will know that over the past 16 years a more diverse system has been put in place and there are many more opportunities for tenants than there were 16 years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cirencester and Tewkesbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my hon. Friend could clarify one point. I am concerned that confusion could arise when a tenant enters a social housing unit and does not have the right to buy, whereas an equivalent tenant across the street in a different scheme does have that right. Would my hon. Friend consider giving a warning, similar to that given to shorthold tenants under the Housing Act 1988, so that when a tenant goes into a scheme where there is no right to buy, he is in absolutely no doubt about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point. My hon. Friend will be aware that the thrust of the proposals is to make the right to buy as extensive as possible. We are concerned that as many tenants as possible should enjoy the right, which is the purpose of clauses 15 and 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rent to mortgage may still have its day. The hon. Member for Attercliffe knows that the present position of the scheme is due in large measure to the fact that house prices have fallen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I cannot let my hon. Friend get away with not answering my question. Will he ensure that tenants who go into a social housing unit are in no doubt about whether or not the right to buy exists for them? Will he provide a mechanism to that effect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend should take on board the fact that, through the provisions we are making the right to buy more widely available than previously. He is right that tenants should be aware of their rights and we are anxious that they should be so aware.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Attercliffe knows that one day the housing market may change and he may be a little premature in his comments about rent to mortgage. For the purposes of the purchase grants scheme, rent to mortgage would be an unnecessary complication. I invite the hon. Gentleman to see his comments in that context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary appals me even further. He suggests that there will be one statutory instrument to cover the whole country and to designate all the parishes and parts of parishes. I wonder whether he has read the procedures for making statutory instruments, which make up a fairly weighty book. The form in which the original consultation for Berkshire
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0076">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
was issued would not have made it past the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, because there were substantial problems with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us examine the constitutional position. If people are upset about their group of houses being either side or outside a parish boundary, how do they make parliamentary representation? They would have to get hold of their Member of Parliament and ask him or her to table a prayer against the order for the whole country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Normally, an hour and a half is allowed for a prayer, unless great pressure is put on the Whips, in which case—with luck—two and a half hours may be allowed. I would guess that there will be at least six or seven places where people are unhappy with their designation, but how much time will Members have to put forward their constituents' point of view? There will be a pretty miserable allocation from the one and a half or two and a half hours. Inevitably, the Minister will spend quarter of an hour explaining the purpose of the order, and it is almost certain that the Opposition spokesmen will use a similar amount of time—although the Liberal Democrats sometimes manage to take a little less time than the Labour Front Bench. The amount of time available for an individual Member of Parliament to put a constituent's case is extremely small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is therefore an abuse of democracy to try to cover the whole country in one order. If maps are involved in a statutory instrument, the Government have to lay a copy of them with the order. Duplicated maps, such as those in the order concerning Berkshire, would not be satisfactory, so someone would have to take to the Table Office several thousand Ordnance Survey maps showing all the boundaries so that hon. Members could go and look at them—not that many hon. Members would bother.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government would also have to ensure that the maps were placed in local libraries throughout the country. Someone who was thinking of moving into an area or of accepting an offer would go and find the statutory instrument, which has a fairly vague map, and would then discover that he had to go somewhere else to find the definitive, large-scale map which made it absolutely clear on which side of a boundary a particular house was located. That is a pretty appalling procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would have been far easier for the Government to have enabled an individual to make representations about a case with some chance of someone listening and to have set up a procedure whereby it could have been clearly shown locally how an individual property was affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of their Lordships on the Statutory Instruments Committee have been getting upset about the fact that the maps do not show which way is north. Most of the maps have grid lines, but it is interesting to note that no one has bothered to put the numbers on the lines, so they do not help people to identify a location and they are certainly not good enough to identify specific properties—which I should have thought would have been a requirement under the procedure that the Government propose to use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
The Under-Secretary should have another look at the procedures. It would be far better for the rights of individuals if the Government chose a different route.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand fully the stress that the hon. Gentleman lays on individual rights. I hope he will be reassured to hear that we intend to carry out a full process of consultation. I suggest that that is the answer to his concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If everybody is happy in a consultation there is no problem, but if the Under-Secretary cannot guarantee that nobody will be unhappy after consultation, the Government should do more than simply ask people for their opinion. There should be a way in which somebody other than an Under-Secretary could test opinion. It is difficult to consult properly if the Government do not promise to listen to the responses. The trouble with consultation is that some people will support the proposal and others will oppose it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course we will listen to the responses to the consultation. We shall consult fully. The consultation process is the appropriate way for the individual to be heard. The hon. Gentleman's route would be lengthy and complex. I re-emphasise the importance of consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Raynsford 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has had some difficulty pleasing the Committee. My hon. Friend the Member of Denton and Reddish presented a forceful and lucid case for greater clarity rather than dependence on orders, and against the complex proposal for orders that is implicit in the system that the clause creates. My hon. Friend the Member for Attercliffe rightly highlighted the strange history of the rent-to-mortgage scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary had the greatest difficulty in satisfying not the Opposition, but his hon. Friend the Member of Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Clifton-Brown), who wanted all applicants who moved into a property that was exempt from the right to buy to receive a health warning. It is understandable that the hon. Gentleman wants tenants to be clear about that but the Under-Secretary cannot give an assurance because orders and rules can change under the immensely complex procedure in the clause, which includes a power to regulate by order. Therefore, a tenant who has moved into a house, believing that he has the right to buy, may find that he has lost it as a result of a stroke of a ministerial pen on an order that goes through late at night, despite the valiant efforts of my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish to ensure an hour and a half of debate on the matter—that is all that can be done to stop it. A change in the orders could also grant the right to buy to someone who did not initially have it. Confusion and chaos will ensue. Sadly, the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury is not in his place. I disagreed with him on previous occasions in Committee, and I am sorry that he is not here to hear me endorse his sensible point entirely. He is unhappy about the Minister's line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause establishes a complex and confusing set of procedures, which will lead to anomalies,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0077">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
complexities, unhappiness, conflict and disagreement. I forecast that we shall not hear more about the rent-to-mortgage scheme. The Minister's hope that it will mysteriously revive in future will be disappointed. It will go the way of the right to repairs, which was one of the highlights of the mid-1980s. It had fewer than 100 takers in three years before the Department of the Environment decided to abandon it as too embarrassing to maintain. It will go the way of part IV of the Housing Act 1988, which, despite the valiant efforts of tenants in the borough represented by the right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South (Mr. Brooke), found few takers elsewhere in Britain and is repealed by part VIII of the Bill. The rent-to-mortgage scheme will share its fate, and we shall hear no more about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we shall hear more about the anomalies, complexities, and problems of defining the areas and properties that are to be exempt. It would have been better if the Under-Secretary had adopted our view that firm and precise definitions should be agreed and included in the Bill. We are not alone in that view—organisations such as the Rural Development Commission specifically said that they preferred a framework in which properties covered by, for example, section 106 agreements, were explicitly excluded to eliminate doubt, uncertainty and the risk of a change in policy at the stroke of a ministerial pen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are far from convinced by the Under-Secretary's answers or the procedures that the clause establishes, but our anxiety will be as nothing to that of the unfortunate people who will have to try to interpret the provisions and experience the impact on their homes, and on their prospects of buying their home in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>SOCIAL HOUSING GRANTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 120, in page 11, line 39, leave out from "with" to second "housing" and insert "their".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the amendment will not trouble the Committee for too long. Clause 17(1) confers powers on the corporation to make social housing grants. The amendment would remove the reference to social housing, which was included originally in the Bill
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0078">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
because profit-making landlords might hold other forms of housing. We want to make it clear that social housing grant can be paid only for the provision of social housing rather than for activities connected with other forms of housing that profit-making landlords might own. Now that the licensed landlord provisions have been removed, the reference is no longer needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By removing the words, we will return to the wording in section 50 of the Housing Act 1988, under which housing association grant is paid. Social housing grant is, therefore, housing association grant by another name. It will be payable for the same range of activities and payments will be restricted to registered social landlords.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not object in principle to what the Government are doing, but I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary could confirm that the amendment will have no unforeseen and unfortunate consequences. When speaking to a subsequent amendment, I shall be highlighting specific issues relating to small organisations that provide care as well as housing and which may be eligible for special needs management allowance. I want to be satisfied that the amendment will not preclude the payment of such grants by the Housing Corporation, but deals simply with the availability of housing association grant, which is the normal grant for which associations are eligible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that the Under-Secretary is waiting for advice, so I shall continue speaking. I stress that I am seeking information rather than wanting to cause the hon. Gentleman any difficulty. If he can assure us that there will be no change to the eligibility of housing associations and other organisations that might expect to receive special needs management allowance and would have qualified for it without the amendment being made, we shall not oppose it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman put his question clearly. He said that foresight was at the heart of his concern. It is fair to say that the courts have spent many happy hours discussing the meaning of the word "foresight". I tread with some care when I am asked what has been foreseen. I believe that I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he wants: we have exercised foresight in the matter and it excludes the possibilities to which he was referring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 93, in page 12, line 7, after "specify", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and in the setting of these conditions the Corporation shall have regard to the size and duration of the grant".</p></blockquote>
The amendment is concerned with the specific issue that I highlighted in our brief discussion on the previous Government amendment. It deals with organisations that are not large-scale housing associations which provide mainstream housing, but those that provide other services, in particular, supportive services to people who need care and support, as well as housing. A consequence of the Bill, which we support, is that there will be greater opportunities for such bodies—including small voluntary organisations—to apply for
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
and receive registration as social housing organisations. They will, therefore, be entitled to apply directly for grant to carry out those functions and not have to depend on the grant being channelled through a housing association as happens now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under present arrangements, for organisations that provide special needs and support for people who need more than bricks and mortar and a roof over their heads, the grant must be channelled through the housing association. It cannot be paid directly to the other voluntary organisation. That will change under the Bill. We therefore believe that some voluntary organisations will want to register, not to claim large capital grants—that is not their function or purpose—but to receive the much smaller revenue grants, which will enable them to provide those support services.

There is a difference. The regulatory regime appropriate to housing associations receiving large capital sums must be extremely rigorous—and rightly so. The regulatory regime applying to organisations receiving relatively small sums of revenue funding must be rigorous but need not be so complex. For example, there would be no real need for detailed forward business planning or for accounts to demonstrate the financial security of the organisation for many years ahead, as would be the case when considering making available a large sum of capital funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to enable the Housing Corporation to have regard to the size and duration of the grant. It would thus be able to set up a regulatory framework for smaller organisations looking simply for special needs management allowance different from that applying to normal housing association grant recipients. We do not say that there should be no close monitoring. Monitoring should be both close and thorough. However, it could be a different type of monitoring, with a different focus than the arrangements for monitoring mainstream housing association activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, the former Minister for Housing, the right hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young), asked the Housing Corporation to devise a scheme for carrying out a detailed review of the payment of special needs management allowance every three years. That review framework is now in operation. Every housing scheme in the country that receives special needs management allowance is subject to that review, but on a different time scale from the framework for reviewing other housing association activity. In drawing up that regime, the corporation accepted that its normal regulatory activities are not appropriate for monitoring the special needs of organisations receiving special needs management allowance—SNMA—and that a separate, special regulatory regime is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment does not mean that the present review framework is the only form of regulation to which new social landlords should be subject, but it invites the corporation to draw up a regulatory regime that is appropriate for the size of grant received and the intended time for which the grant is available. If all social landlords were subject to the same regulatory regime irrespective of the size and duration of their
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0079">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
grants, it would undoubtedly deter many smaller organisations from coming forward. They would believe that it is not worth their while to have to comply with the detailed and onerous requirements for registration that rightly apply to housing associations seeking larger sums for public money in the form of capital grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment does not suggest a different regulatory regime for different types of social landlord. We would regard that as equally inappropriate. There should be a similar regime for all landlords, whatever their type. It is the differences in the size of the scheme and the nature of the grant that is important. I stress that I am talking about organisations looking for relatively small revenue grants rather than large capital grants. The amendment was moved in the same spirit as many of the amendments moved last week. We believe that it will improve the Bill. There is no hidden agenda, and no attempt to frustrate the Government's purpose of creating a new framework for social housing grant, which we broadly support. However, the amendment would deal with a potential anomaly and make it possible for such organisations to be registered and to continue performing their functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Under-Secretary is not able to accept the wording of the amendment, I hope that he will at least accept its spirit, in which case we shall be happy for him to return with appropriate wording at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the spirit in which the hon. Gentleman moved the amendment. I hope that I can respond in a similar vein.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the underlying principle described by the hon. Gentleman, namely, that the regulatory regime should take into account the size of the organisation when determining the amount of the grant and the conditions to be attached to it. The principle that the conditions attached to a grant should bear some relation to its size is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Greenwich seemed to accept the need for minimum standards in regulation. Minimum standards and conditions should be attached to any grant made with taxpayers' money, not least to take into account the probity with which and the purposes for which it is spent. I suggest that we can trust the Housing Corporation to be discriminating and to operate like a sensible funder. The Committee will appreciate that if the Housing Corporation began to impose onerous conditions on landlords seeking small amounts of money, demand for the grant would soon dry up. That would be in no one's interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take on board the hon. Gentleman's concerns and I note the examples that he gave in support of the principle that he put forward. I cannot go quite so far as I think he would want me to, because I do not think that the amendment would improve the Bill. However, I hope that I can reassure him by telling him that I understand the spirit in which he expresses his concerns. I shall not go so far as to take the amendment away to consider it, but I take note of the hon. Gentleman's worries and hope that I have responded in an appropriate spirit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall press the Under-Secretary a little further, if I may. In an earlier debate, the Minister
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration, who is not now present, accepted that there might be a case for discussing a particular issue with the Housing Corporation and returning to the subject if, after such discussion, a genuine problem was apparent. The Minister said that he would ensure that any problem that emerged was rectified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that the Under-Secretary has taken our amendment on board, but we should like him to go further. I should feel more reassured if he was willing to communicate with the Housing Corporation, to see whether a reasonably firm guarantee could be obtained as to the operation of a framework such as we have been discussing. The Housing Corporation is a large bureaucracy and inevitably has its own administrative concerns and priorities. It may be tiresome and tedious for the corporation to have to prepare separate regulatory regimes. A single, straightforward regime might be easier for it. That would cut across the interests of several organisations that wanted to register as social landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will at least assure us that he is prepared to discuss the matter with the Housing Corporation. If he is satisfied after doing so that no problem exists, that will be fine, but I hope that if a potential problem is identified, he will return to the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always desirable to listen and to consult. Perhaps in the case that we are discussing, a case can be made out for consultation as the hon. Gentleman describes. While I give the hon. Gentleman no promises or guarantees to return to the matter, I am always prepared to listen to the views of the Housing Corporation. I hope that that is a suitably accommodating response from me, appropriate to the spiring already established in this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, and on the basis of what he has said I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 125, in page 12, line 7, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3A) The Secretary of State shall issue and publish annual guidance to the Corporation on affordable levels of rents, to which the Corporation shall have regard when making grants in accordance with this section.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would require the Secretary of State to give the corporation annual guidance on what he considered to be affordable rent levels. The corporation would have to take that into account in exercising its powers under clause 17 to decide how social grants were to be paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative party and the Opposition parties have all expressed concern about rising rent levels, particularly in the housing association sector. The reasons for that concern are various, but there is no doubt that there is a close link between rent levels and housing benefit costs and that that has a great effect on public expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another area about which some hon. Members are particularly concerned is the poverty trap in which those on housing benefit find themselves. The poverty trap
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0080">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>129</span>
deepens as rents rise. It follows that for public expenditure and social policy reasons, the Government should give explicit consideration to the relationship between the level of capital subsidy that is provided within the development programme and the level of rents that social landlords will have to charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other points that I shall make when I reply to the Minister, but I should like to hear the Government's views. I know that they are as concerned as I am about rent levels and I look forward to hearing the Minister's reviews before I make further points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government are interested in rent levels, but I do not think that in these circumstances guidance documents on affordability would be particularly helpful. That does not mean that we do not recognise the importance of rent levels and their relationship to income or that we do not give that full consideration in setting grant levels. The hon. Lady will know that there is a trade-off between rent levels and social housing output, but lower rents for some tenants may mean that others are still on the waiting list because fewer houses are being built.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have always accepted the need to strike a balance. We said in the housing White Paper that we would strike a balance between keeping all rents down through higher grant rates and helping individual tenants through housing benefit. We do that each year in deciding on the headline grant rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Christchurch will also know that the corporation already publishes each year the calculations and assumptions on which advice to the Secretary of State on the setting of the grant rate is based. It does so in its grant rate paper, which provides statistical evidence of the relationship between tenants' incomes, rents, development costs, running costs and grant rates. We consider all those factors and we look at rent levels and bear in mind appropriate considerations. However, the sort of guidance document envisaged in the amendment would not be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's answer is not adequate. We are dealing with one of the issues that is most crucial to housing associations and their tenants, namely, affordability. An increasing number of housing association tenants find that they cannot afford to pay their rent without dependence on means-tested benefit. As a result, they are plunged into a poverty trap and are unable to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give one simple illustration, which relates to a housing association scheme that I opened a few months ago in south-east London, not in my constituency, but in a neighbouring area with a high level of unemployment and low wage rates for people in annual employment. The housing association scheme was well-designed and attractive. It was built to Parker Morris standards, which is not always the case these days, and it was a pleasure, when looking around the development, to see how well and how sensitively the scheme had been designed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I asked about the rent levels, I was told that the rent for two-bedroom houses, which were the bulk of the property on the new estate, was £85 a week. That was the rent alone. That charge did not cover council
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
tax, water rates or heating costs. By the time the families had paid those charges, they faced weekly outgoings on their housing and housing-related costs of £120 a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that area, where many people find it difficult to earn £200 a week, the prospect of spending £120 on housing costs is unrealistic. So when I asked the managers of the housing association how many tenants were receiving benefit and how many were paying the rent out of their income, the answer was disappointing and shocking, but it was not a surprise. Every single family was on housing benefit. These people were not the retired, the disabled or those unlikely to be seeking work, but young families trapped in unemployment because they were on housing benefit as a condition of paying their rent. As a result, they had no prospect of finding a job. That cannot be right. The policy traps people into unemployment and forces them into benefit dependency because rents are so high that they cannot be afforded by people in modestly paid employment. Something has gone fundamentally wrong, and I cannot believe that the object of Government policy is to force people into unemployment and poverty traps of that nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of affordability is crucial, but it has not been satisfactorily resolved in recent years. The issue was discussed at great length during consideration of the 1988 Housing Bill because it was feared that the new financial regime for housing associations would increase dependence on borrowing from the private sector and that that would lead to substantial rent increases. At the time, we were assured that there would be proper concern for affordability, that housing associations would be required to demonstrate that their homes were affordable and that the Housing Corporation would monitor them to ensure that property was affordable. However, there has been an inexorable rise in rents. As rents become higher, more tenants are forced into benefit dependency to the point that 80 per cent. of new housing association lettings go to people on benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trend is in one direction and the Government have contributed to that through the cuts in housing association grant. In the late 1980s, 75 per cent. of the total capital cost of new schemes was met by housing association grant. The average now is only 58 per cent. and many people expect demand for the grant to fall. Against that background, rent increases are inevitable. It is not adequate for the Minister to say that the Government are aware of the problem and that they are keeping tabs on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Christchurch rightly highlights the issue of affordability. It suggest that the Secretary of State should publish guidance on affordable levels of rent. That would at least set a benchmark and it would start the process of making rents affordable. I hope that the Minister will have further thoughts and that he will not reject the amendment out of hand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to express a concern that is based on my experience of rent levels in housing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0081">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
association houses. It is not unknown for some of the most expensive rents to be charged by housing associations. In my constituency, some people have had to turn down the offer of a housing association tenancy because they cannot afford to pay the rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When members of the family leave home, under-occupancy creates further problems. Some people are caught in that trap. They do not qualify for housing benefit because of the under-occupancy rule that is set by the Department of the Environment together with the Department of Social Security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State must be aware of what is happening to rent levels. One way in which he could be made aware is to require him to publish an annual review of rent levels throughout the regions. The amendment would set up such a review. The Secretary of State sets the poundage of council tax for business premises throughout the country. That rate influences the rent levels of commercial properties. If it is right for the Secretary of State to review the rent levels and rateable values of properties in the commercial sector, a similar principle should apply to rent levels in social housing in the public sector something about which many people have expressed concern. If the amendment were accepted, people would be assured that rent levels would be monitored. That would provide the opportunity to express concern about the affordability of some of the rents charged for housing association accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Minister's attention to the decision taken by the Government a couple of years ago. There was a problem of empty houses and some people were unable to sell their properties, so the Prime Minister said in a statement to the House that housing associations would be allowed additional resources to purchase empty properties in various areas. That initiative failed because the rent levels were such that people could not afford to rent houses purchased by housing associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of factors lead us to say that it is time that the Secretary of State carried out a review of rent levels. He should undertake an annual review. That would allow us to demonstrate where the Department of the Environment was going astray. The Department does not take into consideration the circumstances that exist in many areas. In my constituency, for example, jobs have been lost as a result of what has happened to the mines, other types of heavy industry and the support services. The Secretary of State has recognised that there are areas of deprivation. I consider that he has some responsibility to ensure that rent levels are affordable in such areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to consider the amendment carefully. It is constructive and it will help many people, particularly those in deprived areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Minister realises just how much damage the Government have done by switching housing benefit from bricks and mortar to individuals in recent years. They must take more account of that factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me describe to the Minister an experience that I had not long ago while out canvassing on a Sunday morning. There was a relatively new housing association property on my round. The electoral register
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
showed that each of the 10 properties had one householder, who was a woman. In eight of the 10 households, a man answered our knock at the door. We had to do some manoeuvring to find out how the household would vote. These men were clearly visiting for the weekend, and in several households they were only too happy to describe the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One man told me bluntly what had happened. He and the woman with whom he had been living had been buying a house. He had a good job but when he lost it, they got into financial trouble. They split up and the house was repossessed. The woman was rehoused in housing association property, and he was staying in a bedsit. The man was now back in work, but it was not particularly well paid. There was no way in which he could move back into the household permanently and they could pay the rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The man was obviously visiting at weekends, and probably a little more often. But as far as the housing association was concerned, the woman was the tenant. The rent, which was paid by the social services, was based on her income. The man had a job, but lived somewhere else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a situation is extremely destructive where children are involved. It is a direct result of the Government's decision to subsidise people in housing association properties, but to allow the rents to go up and up and to pay the subsidy entirely through the social security system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation gets worse and worse. Thousands, if not tens of thousands, of households in this country are now kept apart by the Government's insistence on putting up rents and reducing any subsidy that exists through the rent rebate system, rather than accepting that there is a need to keep housing association rents down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a crisis for many families. People regularly ask me if I can get them out of a housing association property and into a council property, because the rents are so much lower. Couples can get back together in a council property, but they are kept apart if they stay in a housing association property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Stockport council last made nominations for housing association properties, it would not nominate anyone who was not on benefits, because it did not believe that anyone in work could afford to pay the rents. That was appalling. Previously, we were concerned about the way in which estates once became ghettoised by local authorities and, on the whole, local authorities have worked hard to overcome that problem. Increasingly, housing associations are being pushed into that position, because they can accommodate only people on benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People on benefits have far less money to spend. That tends to have an effect on the appearance of an estate. People cannot afford to spend money on their front gardens, however much they may want to, so the estate gets a bit tatty. The more tatty the estate looks, the less willing other people are to move into it. There is a downward spiral.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is amazing that the housing policy of a party that claims to be the party of the family does more and more to drive a wedge between people in families and to make it more likely that the father does not live with the family, but comes home only at the weekend and has a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>133</span>
semi-detached responsibility. That is deplorable and the Government should do something about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hanson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support what my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish has said. I know of estates built recently in my constituency that have exactly the problem that he has just described, because of the dependence on benefits of the people who have been put in them and because of a lack of income to ensure that people can maintain standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the proposal made by the hon. Member for Christchurch. The Secretary of State should publish annual guidance on the affordability of rents. The trend in Wales in the past few years has been similar to that in the constituency of my hon. Friend for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) and in other constituencies. In the past seven years there has been a continued reduction in housing association grant and a continued forcing up of housing association rents. The pushing up of those rents has meant that only people on housing benefit can afford to live in housing association properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1988–89, local authority rents in Wales stood at £22.35 a week. Housing association rents stood at £22.59 a week—only 24p more expensive. Average local authority rents in Wales today are £31.32 a week, while the average for housing association rents is £44.38 a week—a difference of £13.06.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As housing association grant has been cut, housing association rents have had to rise, and they are now well out of step with local authority rents and unaffordable for constituents of mine and people elsewhere in Wales. Shelter Cymru estimates that housing association rents in Wales have risen by 96 per cent. in the past five years. Housing association property is not being made more affordable and it is not being made available to people who are not on housing benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been estimated that for every 1 per cent. decrease in housing association grant, rents for housing association properties in Wales have risen by £1 per week. Housing association rents are getting completely out of synch with local authority rents. Once the two were level; now they are not, and housing association rents are becoming increasingly unaffordable. The amendment of the hon. Member for Christchurch, under which the Secretary of State would publish annual guidance, is well worth considering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is important because the people who are now entering housing association property in Wales are on benefit. For the reason that my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish mentioned, the sector is now benefit-based and benefit-oriented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Wales, average male earnings are among the lowest in Great Britain—86 per cent. of the average. Wales is at the bottom of the table of regional wage income in the United Kingdom. Thirty-three per cent. of men and 60 per cent. of women in Wales earn less than the Council of Europe decency threshold. Average incomes in Wales are 19 per cent. below the United Kingdom average. We need seriously to consider making rents affordable, so that people who are in
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
work—who are working damned hard to try to earn a living—can afford housing association property, not just people who are on housing benefit, although they need it and should have it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trend has been one of reducing housing grant and increasing housing association rents. Given the current poverty levels of pay in Wales, we need affordable rents. I certainly support the publication and monitoring of rents, so that people in government and in the corporations in Wales and England can assess what people can afford and ensure that they can meet their own housing needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hampstead and Highgate)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support the amendment and the contributions of my hon. Friends. The majority of referrals to housing association properties in my constituency come from local authorities or organisations that deal with people with special needs—whether mental or physical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The majority of housing association properties in my constituency are in residential streets—as I said this morning, many housing associations have saved residential areas by taking over large properties built for one family that over the years have become impossible for one family to maintain. By restoring such interesting buildings, housing associations have managed to retain a community and community feeling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A vast gap is growing between the amount deemed an affordable rent and tenants' ability to earn that amount. Industrial work has virtually disappeared in London, and the majority of people work in service industries—and, in my constituency, in service industries that are in the main extremely badly paid. I can only reiterate and concur with what my hon. Friends have already said: many people in housing association properties can keep their homes only by claiming housing benefit. Many who would dearly like to work know that they will lose their homes if they do. As many tenants of housing associations whom I know are single women with children, it is impossible for them to break out of that poverty trap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those points have already been made lucidly by my hon. Friends. We are considering extending the right to buy to housing association tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, we spoke about the need to avoid creating a ghetto. If no method exists of maintaining affordable housing association rents, there is potential for social unrest. People are resentful—I have heard constituents say, "I work hard, I pay my rent. Why should the person next door have a better property when he's not paying his rent?" If the increase in rents in the social sector, especially for housing association properties, is on an upward spiral, and the possibility of tenants working is precluded, disparities will become more apparent, and the potential for serious neighbour and neighbourhood disputes will grow. We can all go to the Minister with stories of neighbourhood disputes. Doubtless they are part and parcel of the stresses of life in an urban area at the tail end of the 20th century, but it would be wrong to ignore the possibility of social unrest, and to reject the opportunity to examine ways in which to provide affordable housing, and to include such provisions in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed in the Minister's response. The Government's views are changing: they used to believe that housing benefit should take the strain, but recently they have begun to realise how much that costs the country, and that it is not a good idea. They have said that rents in the social sector have risen enough. Therefore, I was disappointed that the Minister did not take the opportunity to debate that important issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the support of some members of the Committee for the amendment. They emphasised the importance of affordable housing, and the number of people who cared a lot about it. I can cite a sad case in my constituency of elderly people who wanted a housing transfer to be near their daughter for care. It was arranged, but they refused to move because they could not afford the rent. It is important to consider seriously the question of affordable rents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the medium term, there is a direct relationship between the amount of capital subsidy that is provided and the amount of private finance that must be raised, and thus the level of rent that is needed to service the loans. It is possible to model such a relationship. The Housing Corporation model is excellent. I commend it to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in the Government's interest for affordable rents to form a vital part of their policy on social housing and social security expenditure. As other hon. Members said, that policy has links with employment policy. A well-informed and transparent process of setting objectives for social housing rents should be established. I hope that the Minister will give the Committee a more reassuring answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the points that have been made. The Government are not oblivious to the need for affordable housing. We have made our commitment to affordable housing crystal clear. I appreciate the points that the hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) made about low-income recipients in his constituency, and the family circumstances that the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish described. However, the Opposition need to maintain a sense of proportion when they consider our record on providing properties for affordable rents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Average housing association rents for all properties are currently £38 a week. Average rents on new properties, to which a good deal of reference has been made, are £56 a week. That compares to the average private sector rent of £75 to £80 a week. We are committed to maintaining affordable housing. We are also committed to setting a balance between housing at affordable rents and maintaining an output of such properties. Hon. Members know that there is a balance to be struck and I suggest to the hon. Member for Christchurch that we are alive to the need to strike it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister talked about average rents. What is the top rate of rent? That is what concerns many of us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One can always look at the very top rent. I cannot give the hon. Lady a figure, but the average figure goes a long way to making the point that we are providing a great deal of affordable accommodation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I press the Minister on the figures? He gave the average housing association rent as £37, but conceded that the average on new letting was more than £50. That is precisely the consequence of Government policy. The lower overall average reflects that fact that, until 1988, housing association tenants were entitled to a fair rent set by a rent officer. Generally, they were lower and broadly comparable to those of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a huge increase in rents for the assured tenancies that have been created since the 1988 Act. My hon. Friend's and the hon. Member for Christchurch have highlighted the problems. People are unable to afford their rent without being dependent on housing benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is precisely in the new lettings, where assured tenancies apply, that all the problems are concentrated. Will the Minister please focus on that sector of the market rather than drawing an average which is inevitably misleading?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the average is not misleading. I drew the average to answer the general concerns that were expressed about affordable rents. The hon. Gentleman has jumped a little ahead of me—I am about to say something about our approach to new lettings—but I should keep things in context and deal with output. There is a balance to be struck between personal subsidies and bricks and mortar. We need to maintain the output of social housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reassure the Committee that we are alive to the need to strike a balance. The hon. Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford) spoke earlier about the changes in the grant rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to keep on this point and answer the point made by the hon. Member for Greenwich, who has set the matter in the context of the fall in the cost of output over the period he discussed. Building and land costs have fallen, which has affected the costs facing housing associations. Against this background, there have been the changes in grant, to which he referred. He knows that this year the grant has been maintained at last year's level of 58 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the costs have gone down, why has the average rent leapt up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the point. I have accepted the figures on the rents and have given them to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is that the Committee has to take account of the fact that while grant rates have reduced, housing associations have faced in the same period a substantial reduction in costs. Against that background, the Government have had to fix a balance to maintain the output of social housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am alive to the point about the importance of affordable new housing. This year, for the first time, we have introduced to the bidding process consideration of associations' prospective rate when deciding which projects should be grant-funded for 1996–97. Associations' average rent at first letting for new
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0084">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>137</span>
developments has been an important factor. The corporation has recently announced this year's annual development programme. Under the new system, in which prospective rents are taken into account in the bidding round, rents are coming in well below those implied by the grant rate model. The system is working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are alive to the worries which have been expressed, but balances must be struck and the present system is a better way in which to achieve our objectives than the imposition of arbitrary guidance. The amendment is unhelpful and I must resist it. The Government are alive to the worries that have been expressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>PURCHASE GRANT WHERE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE EXERCISED.</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 19 relates to the grants available to social housing landlords from the Housing Corporation to cover the discounts that are paid to people exercising the right to buy. We do not oppose that principle, but we notice that inconsistency in the Government's treatment of housing associations and their treatment of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause allows a grant to social landlords being the aggregate of the value of discounts given during the year. In other words, the whole value of the discounts paid to tenants who are exercising the right to buy is recompensed by the Housing Corporation. That guarantees that the social housing landlord receives the
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
full sale value. In a parallel provision, the Government are rightly requiring social housing landlords to put that money into a separate ring-fenced account and apply it to new housing investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That guarantees benefit to all parties. The tenant who buys has the advantage of being able to buy his or her home, while others who did not have that advantage will, at least, have the prospect of another unit of social housing that will be generated by the application of that receipt to new investment purposes. That may mean building a new home or renovating an existing one to bring it up to standard. That principle is sensible and admirable, and we thoroughly support it. Why do not the Government accept the same logic for local authority housing?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities receive, not the full value of the houses that they sell, but the discounted value. Discounts on houses can be as much as 70 per cent., but local authorities generally receive only 50 per cent. of the market value. In addition, local authorities do not have the freedom to use that money for reinvestment. Of their reduced capital receipts—on average, only 50 per cent. of market value—they are allowed to use only 25 per cent. for reinvestment. The rest has to be set aside for debt redemption—there could be no clearer illustration of Government bias against local authorities and of the different treatment that they and housing associations receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The treatment that local authorities receive is bitterly resented. Tenants bitterly resent it because they know that, if local authorities were free to use their capital receipts, they would be able to do more to improve rundown estates, install central heating, to modernise and repair properties and make living conditions better. Tenants know that the homeless would have a better prospect of being housed if authorities could build more housing. They resent the restrictions that prevent the receipts from being used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I never fail to take the opportunity to point out that tenants are even more angry at the fact that the Government have breached all the pledges they gave when they introduced the right-to-buy policy in 1980. They said that all capital receipts could be reused. Ministers were adamant that local authorities would be free to use their capital receipts for reinvestment. When the Secretary of State for Transport was Minister for Housing and Planning, he reinforced that point by telling the House that local authorities had no excuse not to use their capital receipts. Not only did he say that local authorities could use their receipts, but that they had no excuse for not doing so. Despite that, the Government have restricted local authorities from using their receipts to the point that only 25 per cent. of them can be used; 75 per cent. must be set aside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The picture is as I have described it, except for a brief period of light between 1992 to 1994, which was the result of the enlightened policy of the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Thames (Mr. Lamont), whom we shall soon have to get used to describing as the right hon. Member for Harrogate should he win that seat. When the right hon. Gentleman was Chancellor, he introduced a capital receipts holiday between November 1992 and March 1994. In that period, local authorities were free
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0085">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>139</span>
to use all their capital receipts. That was a sensible move by the right hon. Gentleman. He recognised that it would help to revive the economy, which is still struggling in the depths of recession and remains somewhat shaken by the ejection of sterling from the European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is straying wide of the amendment. In the interests of progress, will he return to debating the main thrust of the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand admonished, Mrs. Winterton. I shall return to the main thrust of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Kingston upon Thames recognised the value of the policy spelt out in clause 19, in which the aggregate value of discounts would become available and the money would be recycled to provide new housing investment. That was an admirable and sensible policy, but unfortunately it did not last long. Ministers are not prepared to allow the same freedom now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause throws into sharp relief the treatment of local authorities and housing associations in respect of capital receipts. Labour Members deplore that difference in treatment. We shall not vote against the clause because we support the Government's approach to housing associations, but we shall continue to campaign vigorously between now and the general election for the principle that local authorities should be allowed a similar freedom to use their capital receipts. If they could do so, they would be able to build more of the houses that are urgently needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly associate myself with the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich. In the debate this morning the Government frequently drew attention to the need for similar treatment of tenants of social rented and local authority housing. We also ought to have equal treatment for the future tenants of both sorts of housing; in other words, the reinvestment of receipts from sales to provide additional housing in the local authority sector as well as the social rented sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned about clause 19 and how it will operate. As I understand it, the intention of clause 19 is that as well as the receipts from the sale, which will eventually be included in the total disposal of proceeds under clause 26, the value of the discount will also be returned to associations by way of a grant. The intention is that, where it is deemed appropriate and the housing need exists, the housing association will be able to replace the property that has been sold and meet the housing need in the area that it serves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One difficulty with that is the issue of returning the market value of the property through the proceeds from the disposal and the grant related to the discount. The two will come together to equal the market value of the property. The difficulty is that if the housing association wants to replace the property, it will have to pay the cost of building a property in the area concerned, which may or may not equal the value of the property sold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had a debate on costs of replacement this morning on another amendment. The Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration said that he thought that the cost would net out over total sales;
	<span class='label label-info column'>140</span>
that in some cases, the market value might be higher than the replacement costs and in others it might be lower. I am not sure that the Minster was right about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Under-Secretary provide for the Committee—in writing if he cannot do so now—the evidence from the Department of Environment that that netting out will mean that after the sale sufficient funds will be returned to the housing association, both in the sale proceeds and in grant, to enable them to carry out replacement—in other words, that the value will equal the cost of replacement? It would be interesting to have that information because the Minister said this morning that it was available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an additional problem. Even if that netting out takes place over all the sales of all the associations, the Minister must accept that it is not likely to be equal in its impact on different parts of the country. In rural areas, in particular, it may well be that the value of a property in a particular setting is greater than the cost of replacing it. However, in inner-city areas, it is likely that the value of a property sold on the open market, particularly a property that is part of a development of rented properties, would be less than the cost of replacement. That is almost certainly the case with local authority sales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can go through masses of evidence on local authority sales. In big cities and towns, and inner-city and urban areas the value of a sale as determined by the local authority valuer or the district valuer, to whom appeals are made, is less than the cost of replacement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My concern is for the many small housing associations which operate in only one area, such as the North Sheffield housing association, which operates in my constituency and that of other hon. Members who represent Sheffield. I have a particular interest in a potential major development called the Attercliffe village project, which a number of housing associations are interested in developing. It will be built on derelict industrial land with high costs of construction. The land is contaminated and there is little possibility of the market value of those properties being anything like as high as the cost of replacement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that for such associations operating in areas with great housing needs, the effect of clause 19 will be that proceeds will not be available to replace like with like. Particularly for small associations, there will be no netting out. They will simply suffer a loss and will be unable to replace the properties that are sold. That is not an objection to the principle of a sale. It is a problem of relevance to some associations in inner-city areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a problem with the legislation and I hope that the Minister can come up with a way of resolving the difficulties before they occur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proceedings of the Committee have been conducted throughout with a fair amount of reasonableness and give and take. I hope that the change of personnel this afternoon has not entirely dispersed that spirit of reasonableness. I have tried to be accommodating to the hon. Member for Greenwich, but I must beg to differ with him on the points that he has made about the clause. He has used the clause stand part
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0086">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>141</span>
debate as an opportunity to make a general comparison of our position on housing association discounts and our position on local authority discounts. He also went over some fairly familiar ground about capital receipts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The short answer about the reason for the difference in treatment of local authorities and housing associations is that we place emphasis on housing associations and the new local housing companies as the providers of social housing. That is the reason for the distinction. Housing associations and local housing companies are able to provide greater output of affordable social housing through their access to private finance. By putting greater emphasis on local authorities, the hon. Member for Greenwich would produce a lower output of social housing to meet the needs described by his hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will recall that I stressed that the money could be used either for the construction of new homes or for the renovation of existing ones. Is it not part of Government policy that local authorities should renovate substandard council housing and bring it into a fit condition to let?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the hon. Gentleman, he cannot escape from the point that housing associations and local housing companies can achieve more than local authorities can. That is the reason for the distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will be aware of many of the arguments on capital receipts. We are on fairly familiar ground. He must be alive to the point, which has been made many times, that capital receipts do not in all cases lie in those parts of the country with the greatest housing need. The hon. Gentleman did not deal with the question of distribution that must arise or with more pressing points about the time scale and size of the distributions of capital receipts, nor did he deal with the wider consequences for the public sector borrowing requirement. He knows the arguments. We shall simply have to disagree on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Attercliffe raised a point about tenants' rights that does not apply with much force in the context of the clause. His analogy between the rights of tenants and the rights of authorities was not well drawn. Of course we place emphasis on the rights of tenants, but different considerations arise. Tenants are concerned about having access to social housing. They are not so concerned about the character of the providers of that housing as the hon. Gentleman suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Attercliffe spoke about the cost of the policy and referred to replacement through rebuilding. He said that the receipts from sales at market value would not be sufficient to cover the costs of rebuilding. He will be fully aware that that is not the only way in which social housing can be provided. It can also be provided through replacement housing, via the purchase of existing properties. The Housing Corporation will make discounts available to the associations, which will give them the full market value of the property that has been sold and enable them to
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
replace that property and provide more social housing for tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Attercliffe also raised the netting out effect, to which my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration referred this morning. The best idea is for my hon. Friend the Minister to write to the hon. Gentleman, setting out the basis on which the matter was put to him. I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course housing association can always replace a property by purchasing another rather than by new build but, as the Minister surely understands, in some inner-city areas, the types of properties that have been sold—particularly in areas with bungalows or flats—are not immediately replaceable by similar housing. There may simply be terraced houses and nothing else. That is a problem for housing associations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a slightly different point. The hon. Gentleman is talking about the availability of accommodation, not its cost. My proposition is that the receipt of the market value will enable a housing association to meet the need for replacement, if necessary, by buying existing property. Matters are as simple as that. I suggest that the clause is valuable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>ASSISTANCE FROM LOCAL AUTHORITIES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 21 would allow local authorities to promote new housing bodies—implicitly, local housing companies. The clause would also give local authorities powers to make grants or loans to such bodies, or to
	<br><blockquote><p>"guarantee or join in guaranteeing the payment of the principal on, and interest on, money borrowed"</p></blockquote>
by such organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Interesting questions arise about this provision. The first to do with the guarantee to be given by the local authority on sums that are borrowed by a local housing company. My understanding of the current provision for capital controls, set out under the Local Government and Housing Act 1989, is that any such guarantee, if exercised, would result in the local housing company being interpreted as part of the local authority and as a public sector body whose borrowings would be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0087">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>143</span>
immediately set against the local authority's capital limits. If that is so, there would clearly be little merit in the local authority establishing the company and using those powers of guarantee. I hope that the Under-Secretary can assure us that such controls will be relaxed, if they would otherwise have the effect that I have suggested. If they would not, I should be delighted to hear it. I should like a detailed answer on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second question that I want to raise is about general guidance to be given on the formation of local housing companies and eligibility criteria for registration by the Housing Corporation. I understand—although I should be grateful for clarification by the Under-Secretary—that the Housing Corporation is due to issue a consultation paper on this subject in the next few weeks. If that is so, may we know why that was not issued before the Committee reached this stage of its deliberations, so that hon. Members would have an opportunity to consider the detailed proposals? May we also know what is likely to be in the consultation paper? What will be the key criteria? What guidance will be given to authorities considering setting up local housing companies? The Committee should have an opportunity to consider those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anxiety has been expressed several times about government by regulation and government by quango, and the present case offers both. The Housing Corporation—a quango—is to issue guidance or consultation, on a matter that the Committee has had no opportunity to consider beforehand. That is eminently unsatisfactory. I hope for some suggestion from the Under-Secretary about why, if there is to be a consultation paper, we were not given the opportunity to comment earlier. When will we have the opportunity to see, and perhaps comment on, the contents of that document? It may be difficult to do that, given the way in which we have agreed to proceed with the Bill's consideration, but I hope, Mrs. Winterton, that you will feel sympathetic towards right hon. and hon. Members who want an opportunity to revisit the issue, perhaps on Report. We may not be given an opportunity to consider some important matters in Committee simply because the consultation was not carried out in time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to take up the point about guarantees made by my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich. It is interesting that this issue is before the Committee. In 1998, Sheffield city council was about to launch a major housing partnership scheme. To do so, the council had to guarantee the income of the United Kingdom housing trust which was going to build social housing in Sheffield. The Nationwide building society was going to put private sector money into the scheme. A statement was then made in the House that as from midnight, the Government would introduce regulations to ensure that in future such guarantees would not be allowable from a local authority, in the way that had been intended. Fortunately, by 11.30 pm, a deal had been signed to provide 2,000 social homes in Sheffield so the Government were beaten to the draw in that case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that the Government have had a change of policy, and that guarantees are once again a good idea. I shall be interested to hear the Under-Secretary's response to my hon. Friend's question about
	<span class='label label-info column'>144</span>
whether giving a guarantee counts against a local authority's credit approvals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question is about local authorities promoting what are effectively housing companies. If a local authority promotes a body and appoints to it local authority councillors or officers, will the borrowings undertaken by the organisation count against the local authority's credit approvals? At what stage do those borrowings not count against the local authority's credit approvals? How many directors chosen by the local authority have to be appointed before they count? Is there a minimum or a maximum? What are the rules?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think that the clause is a good idea. However, before we accept it, the Minister should explain how it will operate. If there are all sorts of restrictions which mean that none of the bodies can act without taking a slice of the credit approvals which the Government are already offering local authorities, there will ultimately be no more investment in housing. One would have to question the wisdom of that. However, I am sure that the Under-Secretary will give us some encouraging news.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may assist the hon. Members who have expressed concern if I say a little about the character of clause 21. It enables local authorities to promote and provide assistance to registered social landlords and local housing authorities to sell furniture to the tenants of registered social landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause re-enacts sections 58 and 61 of the Housing Associations Act 1985 in relation to registered housing associations and is amended to cover registered social landlords. I put the clause before the Committee on the basis that there is to be a framework for cooperation between local authorities and registered social landlords. I hope that the Committee will see it in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Greenwich asked a detailed question about the effects of the clause and its consequences for finance. I am afraid that I shall have to write to the hon. Gentleman in order to deal with his question. I think that he understands and accepts that response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman expressed concern about the consultation paper. The Housing Corporation is working on the details of the consultation paper. It is being drawn up by an informal group of practitioners. It will not be available during the Committee's consideration of the Bill—that is a question of timing. It is expected to be ready for April. If the hon.

	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) in determining the manner in which disposal proceeds shall be applied or appropriated the Corporation shall have regard to the local housing strategy of the local authority within whose area the dwelling which was sold was situated.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both amendments would ensure that adequate replacement properties are obtained in the right place and are of the right type, when properties are sold under the right to buy. Under amendment No. 135, when a property that was designed or adapted for a disabled people is sold, it would be replaced with a unit of the same size and accessibility and have similar access to facilities and location where possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning we discussed the right of disabled people to have the same right to buy their property. There is a severe shortage of accessible housing to rent in the social sector for many disabled people. Many problems could be highlighted, but I wish to refer to households that require accessible accommodation for wheelchairs. The national wheelchair housing association estimates that there is a national shortfall of 330,000 in the number of specialised dwellings for wheelchair users. A survey was carried out in Lewisham and work was also undertaken in Greenwich.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be good if the Government would consider going further and ring fencing the money that is
	<span class='label label-info column'>146</span>
obtained from the sale of such properties. Often the replacement costs of a property that has been adapted are more than the market value. I urge the Government to consider how to make up that money. I support the right of disabled people to buy their own properties, but I also believe that there should be a decent supply of housing for those who cannot afford to buy their own properties. That is why amendment No. 135 is so important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 136 is also about replacement properties being of a similar price and in the correct location. I return to what I said earlier about the importance of using the knowledge of local authorities. Local councillors believe that homes sold under the right-to-buy scheme should, whenever possible, be built in a similar area and with the same allocation rights. Local authorities and housing associations work closely together to deal with housing need. When I was a councillor in Southampton, housing associations were bidding for HAG—housing association grant—which I gather is now to be called SAG, which is rather appropriate, as some of us fear that levels will be sagging. Ministers could not have been thinking carefully when they changed that name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing associations play a key role today in every local authority's housing strategy. The purpose of amendment No. 136 is to set firm ground rules for the Housing Corporation when determining how proceeds for housing disposals should be spent. Under the Bill, the corporation has been given a fairly free hand, but despite the Government's assurances about that money being used to build replacement properties, it is not in the Bill. I realise that one cannot always build a property that is exactly right. Two-bedroomed houses that are sold may need to be replaced with three-bedroomed houses—and there may be other changes. However, the key factor is that local authorities should be involved in deciding what is spent on replacement properties. I hope that the Government will oblige the Housing Corporation to bear that in mind when it sets the ground rules for the disposal of receipts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support the amendment. It has a particular resonance in my constituency. It has already been said that, for many inner urban areas, the availability of land—green or brown site—for replacement buildings, is limited in the extreme. That is particularly so in many of the inner London areas. Housing association properties have been built in my constituency on land that has been reclaimed from the railways—land that was no longer needed. Such sites are, in the main, extremely complex and difficult to build upon. Making such sites accessible gives rise to additional costs. Such sites are extremely limited, and the majority of housing association properties tend to be adaptions of larger properties, where many residences can be created out of what was originally one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In supporting the amendment, I wish to speak particularly about those properties designed specifically for people with disabilities. Some of my constituents live in properties that do not yet require doors to be widened, stairs to be removed or ramps to be put in place, because their illnesses do not at the moment necessitate them living in a wheelchair. However, there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0089">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>147</span>
is little doubt that their illnesses will progress and that they will need those changes in future. It is vital that allowance must be made for the additional costs of altering older buildings. In the 18th and 19th centuries, no such considerations were given to people with disabilities and housing associations face additional costs in altering such properties. In many instances, in my constituency and in contiguous constituencies in central London, housing associations can contribute to London's undoubted housing needs only by the adaptation and modernisation of such properties. I strongly urge the Government to look most favourably on the amendment of the hon. Member for Christchurch, because there is a need, which will grow, in already overcrowded urban areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to place on record that representations have been made to me by SCOPE, formerly the Spastics Society, about the problems mentioned by the hon. Member for Christchurch. SCOPE has made it clear that in all cases in which property is sold on such a basis, it must be replaced with a home of equal size and standards of accessibility, for the reasons given by my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson) and the hon. Member for Christchurch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a need for social housing for people with disabilities—they rely on it. The right to buy is available to people with disabilities, but if there is not a replacement home and if money is not reinvested in housing with wheelchair and mobility standards, they will be forced more and more into low-quality, inaccessible housing to their detriment and that of their families.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not unsympathetic to the underlying concerns outlined by the hon. Member for Christchurch in support of her amendment. There is concern about making provision for local housing needs and for the needs of disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I can deal with the hon. Lady's concerns, but the amendment would not assist in meeting them. We already propose that determinations issued under the clause governing the use of the disposals proceeds fund will take local housing need into account. Replacement properties need not necessarily be identical in size, type or category because the current local need might be for something different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>148</span>
The amendment would restrict the flexibility of the corporation and associations to provide the type of housing for which there is the greatest need. I invite the hon. Lady to reflect on that and the need to avoid an overly prescriptive system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 135 deals with the sale of a property designed for a disabled person. The corporation could be required to ensure that a social landlord provides a similar replacement property. That could be too restrictive. Replacement property should meet local needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 136 would require the corporation to take into account the housing strategy of the local authority in whose area the property to be sold was situated when determining how the fund should be applied. We would usually expect replacement properties to be in the same local authority area, although that might not be appropriate in certain cases, for example if there was no local need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are sympathetic to the circumstances of disabled people and intend to be responsive to local needs, but the framework of the amendment is too prescriptive and impractical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
