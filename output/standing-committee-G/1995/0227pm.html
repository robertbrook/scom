	<li>instituted a fair procedure of investigation which they have followed in the particular case before the court.</li>
	<li>not applied to the tenant a standard of behaviour which would be considered discriminatory on the grounds of race, gender, sexual orientation or disability.</li>
	<li>taken into account any special circumstances which may prevent the tenant from maintaining himself in the tenancy.".</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Raynsford 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Committee adjourned, I was in the course of saying that, in his reply, the Minister had confirmed the problem—that the courts could not reach a view as to the reasonableness of the decision leading to possession—and that amendment No. 286 would therefore be necessary if it was felt that the courts should have that opportunity. If we did not pursue the test of reasonableness, amendment No. 287 would provide a framework under which authorities would have to demonstrate that they had acted in a proper and fair way in investigating the matter, that they had not applied a standard of behaviour that might be considered discriminatory, and that they had taken into account the special circumstances that should have been considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are entirely reasonable. They are alternative approaches to the problem. As the right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South (Mr. Brooke) rightly pointed out, there is no need for both of the amendments. However, one or the other would help to make dubious legislation better. I do not propose to leave it to the right hon. Gentleman to decide which of the two should be chosen, because he might disappoint me by saying that neither should be accepted. In our view, one or the other is appropriate. I am disappointed that the Minister did not feel able to go with us on either of them. I encourage my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) to press the amendment to a Division if he does not get a satisfactory response from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was inclined, a little before 1 pm, to say that, as the Minister had given an unsatisfactory reply, the most useful thing to do would be to proceed to vote on the amendment. Since then, however, I have been given a little advice, which suggests that the Minister has the difficult job of ensuring that the guidance to be issued by his Department will be strong and clear. If it is not, he will fall foul of the European convention on human rights, because the Bill will deny people the chance to go to court on the substantive issue. He must therefore make sure that the local authorities' appeals procedures are as good as those in a court of law in taking evidence and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the Minister should take another look at the provision. It would be far better to use a procedure under which the courts could exercise their discretion, but which would narrow their discretion so that they had an opportunity to consider the merits of a case. That would be a far better defence. It seems that the Minister will not budge. I shall therefore follow the advice of my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford) and press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can be brief, as some of the arguments were rehearsed this morning. The amendment and the new clause are designed to ensure that local authorities and registered social landlords take reasonable care when the serve notices on people who are clearly suffering mental health problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Government recognised only last week, too many people with mental health problems slip through the net. The amendment and new clause would ensure that if a social landlord or a local authority serves a notice on a tenant, and knows or believes that that person has mental health problems, and if the notice will lead to eviction, similar notice must be served on a social services department, so that the department can take whatever steps it considers appropriate to protect the person and ensure that other accommodation is available. We rehearsed the arguments and concerns this morning. I hope that the Minister will look favourably on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration (Mr. David Curry)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Lady said, we discussed the matter this morning in the context of amendments Nos. 285, 288 and 315. I said in response to that debate that I believed that, in principle, the guidance should deal with that. I undertook to examine the matter to see whether the guidance needed to be supplemented. To be consistent, I make the same promise in relation to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister. In view of his promise, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Timms 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 289, in page 55, line 25, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(6) The notice shall contain information on the tenant's right to seek advice.".</p></blockquote>
This is a simple amendment and, I hope, an uncontroversial one that the Government will support. It requires that notices of possession proceedings should contain information on the tenant's right to seek advice in the case of introductory tenancies, as is already the case with secure tenancies, assured tenancies and most licences in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once such a notice is issued, there is little time for the tenant to respond. That is made clear by clause 96(1), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A notice of proceedings for possession under section 95 shall inform the tenant of his right to request a review of the landlord's decision to seek an order for possession by serving a notice on the landlord to that effect within seven days after the date on which the notice of proceedings is served."</p></blockquote>
That is the only opportunity provided by the Bill for the tenant to make a defence when a notice of possession proceedings is issued. It is extremely important to ensure that the tenant has access to advice and advocacy and can obtain them swiftly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the period available is only seven days, the information is even more important for people whose
	<span class='label label-info column'>366</span>
first language is not English, people with mental health problems and others whom we may well expect to receive such notices. There is no time to waste. The notice that is served must point people towards the advice and advocacy to which they are entitled. It is in everyone's interests to be able to access it. Other notices of proceedings must provide such information and I hope that me Minister will accept that these should, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not propose mat the Committee accepts the amendment. It would not provide tenants with practical help; they may still not know what to do next. I shall consider what might be offered instead of the amendment, along the lines of a reference to where advice might be sought. If the hon. Gentleman accepts that, I undertake to table a suitable amendment at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that assurance. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>RIGHT TO REQUEST REVIEW OF DECISION TO SEEK POSSESSION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 290, in page 55, line 29, leave out "seven" and insert "fourteen".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 278, in page 55, line 29, leave out "is served" and insert "has expired".</p>
	<p>No. 275, in page 55, line 29, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"or such longer period as may be specified in the notice.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The landlord may extend the time for serving a notice of request for review from time to time whether or not the time has already expired.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment follows on from the previous amendment. It refers to the length of notice that die tenant against whom possession proceedings are being taken has to seek a review of the decision. Under the Bill, the period is seven days. The amendment would increase it to 14 days. It strikes a balance. My guess is that it would be reasonable to allow a period of 28 days for such information, but, because introductory tenancies are designed to provide a means of action against people who behave anti-socially, relatively swift action is necessary, which is why we are not proposing a 28-day period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, seven days is too short because certain tenants, because of illness or psychiatric problems, or those who have been rehoused under care in the community, may not be able to get themselves together within seven days to seek a review. Inexorably, the process will roll and they will be made homeless. Because the outcome will be so drastic, it is right that people have a little longer time in which to seek a review. That is why, in the spirit of compromise, we tabled an amendment that proposes a 14-day period. That period is an appropriate, midway point between ensuring justice to the individual and avoiding the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0212">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>367</span>
community being left waiting for too long for action to be taken in cases of anti-social behaviour. The amendment is a commonsense measure and we hope that the Minister will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The two amendments that are being taken with amendment No. 290 are in my name. I share the concerns of the hon. Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford), but not his spirit of compromise as I wish to be a little more generous to tenants. I have taken advice on the matter from organisations such as Shelter, National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux and MIND, which are genuinely concerned about the people whom they help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many reasons why seven days is not a long enough period in which to request a review. Tenants might be on holiday, in hospital or fleeing violence from ex-partners, for example. At times, such violence has caused proceedings to be taken against them. There are vulnerable groups of people such as those for whom English is not their first language and those with disabilities or mental health problems. Such people will have to go through extra barriers to receive advice when they are served with a notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A case has been brought to my attention of a woman who contacted Shelter after being served with a notice from a local authority seeking possession, because of complaints about her violent ex-partner, who had been causing a nuisance in the area and at her home. She fled the home, but on her return she found the notice. She sought advice in two places, but was unable to persuade the authority that the eviction proceedings should be halted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was only with the help of a Shelter adviser that she was able to persuade the authority that she needed a transfer out of the area to escape violence and that that would remove the nuisance from the neighbourhood. The notice was not appropriate in that case, which illustrates our concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are alternative ways in which to deal with cases concerning vulnerable people, and I hope that the Minister will look favourably on the amendments. The amendments that I tabled attempt in two ways to extend the time limit, and the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Greenwich proposes another way. I hope that the Minister will be generous, at least in spirit, in considering what we want to achieve. I am sure that we would be happy for him to return with a new wording to allay our fears on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hampstead and Highgate)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich. In concert with the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock), I have a constituent who became a target of a drug pusher because it was thought that he had given information to the police. The threats were such that he was unable to spend a night in his home and he was constantly moving from one friend's address to another. If a notice had been issued to him, it is highly unlikely that he would have read it within seven days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking somewhat glibly about obtaining advice. The centres in my constituency that are the
	<span class='label label-info column'>368</span>
natural resources to which I would refer a constituent include the citizens advice bureaux, the law centre and the organisations that work for particularly vulnerable groups—Shelter, MIND and Mencap—but each of those is vastly overstretched and, in many cases, under-resourced. It is not unusual for them to make appointments by telephone only, and people are often unable simply to drop in for advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should bear in mind the fact that obtaining advice can be as difficult as knowing how to apply for it, and the additional seven days proposed in the amendment would be helpful, especially for the organisations that I mentioned, which are only too willing to offer advice. The burdens placed on them by the needs of an ever-increasing constituency of people who are bewildered by the modern day mean that those who require the advice should have longer to obtain it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like, first, to remind the Committee that the people whom we are most concerned about under the clause are those who suffer on the estates because of anti-social behaviour. We must not get into the mode of just seeming massively concerned. The hon. Member for Christchurch asked me to be generous in spirit, but I am anxious to be generous to the people who are suffering from violence and intimidation. I do not want to lose sight of the fact that it is their fate that is at the heart of the issue that we are discussing. That is why we are proposing a peremptory procedure. As we all acknowledge, that is what introductory tenancies are about. The Bill lays down the exceptional circumstances in which action can be taken to deal with a problem before it can contaminate a much wider area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are agreed about that, so the question comes down to balance, which we have discussed umpteen times and will no doubt discuss umpteen more times. We need to find the balance to square the circle, enabling effective action to be taken quickly without making it impossible for people to make representations to defend their case, whether those people are good, bad or indifferent, villainous or virtuous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have looked hard at the amendments. I cannot accept those tabled by the hon. Member for Christchurch because the practical effect would be to allow the tenant to make his request up to 42 days after receiving the notice. Frankly, that tilts too far the other way and gets away from the idea of rapid, urgent action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My initial inclination was to say that, in the interests of urgency that we are trying to achieve, the seven-day provision should be maintained. On reflection, I am willing to accept 14 days. However, I would go no further than that because to do so would dilute the purposes of the Bill. Therefore, I shall accept the amendment that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his sensible and practical response.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to say that, if we were conducting these proceedings in French, one could have cause to question what was said in the previous debate because the French for a fortnight can be "une quinzaine", which means 15 days. Are not we glad that we have such a precise language with which to deal?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 96(4) makes it clear that the review of a local authority decision must be carried out and the tenant notified before the date on which the proceedings for eviction begin. For the tenant, the notice might not make it obvious to which time scale the landlord must work in a review; so amendment No. 255 provides that the notice will spell out the timetable of the review. In that way, the tenant will have more information on the timetable. The amendment is simply a useful addition to the clause, which gives the tenant more precise information about what will happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 279 goes in the opposite direction; it provides that the review can take as long as the landlord decides so that it need not be completed until the proceedings begin. As I said earlier, we must maintain the idea of urgent action and, therefore, I cannot commend amendment No. 279.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a number of instances, in which the tenants of properties have died, the people who lived with them—in most cases for a long period—have come to my surgery or written to me with harrowing stories of the problems that they have had keeping what they regard as their home. I am sure that other members of the Committee—and even Ministers, in their capacity as mere Members of Parliament—have experience of such problems. I sometimes wonder what Ministers say in such circumstances. I can always say, "Of course, it is all the Government's fault. They passed the legislation; it is all their responsibility." I wonder what Ministers say, when it is clearly their fault and they could do something about the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far, the issue that I am raising in relation to clause 97—I am effectively saying, therefore, that clause 98 should not stand part of the Bill—has arisen only in cases of secure tenancies. Because the wording of the Housing Act 1985 is applied directly in the Bill, I want to speak generally about the issue of succession and ask Ministers to address a number of problems that must be dealt with if we are to bring a degree of safety and security to people who feel vulnerable. We can do something to help remove that vulnerability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As Ministers may be aware from my amendment, the problems do not concern the initial succession—I am
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>371</span>
not in any way querying who is entitled to succeed. It is the problems of a second succession that are so difficult. I accept that there is an argument that succession should not be allowed to continue because of the potential for under-occupation of the property. The Minister may advance that argument. However, under-occupation can occur on the first succession—it is not a problem confined to a second or subsequent succession. Often, two people live in a house, one of them dies, and there is an argument about whether the person who remains should succeed. If they do, there is under-occupation, because fewer people live in the property than previously lived there. That is a general problem with succession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must raise the peculiar circumstances that can arise with second successions, which the individuals concerned do not understand. It is impossible to explain to them how the law operates. When that is the case, we should question whether we have good law that we should support. In three cases of which I have had experience, neither the law as it stands nor the Bill's provisions are acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is a fairly traditional case, of which many still arise, in which the man in a man-and-wife partnership is the sole tenant. In the 1930s, for example, it was commonplace for people to gain the tenancy of a property together, but for only the man to become a tenant. Although local authorities have since encouraged joint tenancies, that situation remains the case for some. Let us consider the position of a man and wife, with the man as sole tenant, and a child—now an adult in his 40s or 50s—living in the same house. If the wife dies first, followed by the man, there is no problem. The child—now an adult—who has lived in the house all his life will succeed to that tenancy. That is a fairly straightforward case, and the elderly person need not worry about what will happen to his son or daughter when he dies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, many elderly people are extremely concerned that if they go, the home of their child will go too, and many of them feel guilty if their child has been helping to look after them in their old age. They feel that they are somehow doing him or her down. As often happens, the husband who is the sole tenant, dies first and his wife becomes the successor tenant. When the wife dies, there is no more succession to the child of the relationship, after spending all his life in the property. He has no right to succeed in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is inexplicable and cannot be regarded as reasonable and proper. We cannot relieve the fears of elderly people that when they die their home will be removed from their child. I have known of two or three such cases in the past couple of years. A letter of comfort from the local authority is not the same as writing to tell them their rights under the law. That is what really reassures people in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Increasingly, people have been encouraged to have joint tenancies. Whichever one of the pair dies, leaving the other as the sole tenant, a son or daughter living with them will not have the right to succeed under the Bill. That cannot be right. I cannot believe that that was what
	<span class='label label-info column'>372</span>
was intended when the Bill was first drafted—it is a distinct anomaly which causes enormous difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that he cannot remove all the constraints on second successions, as there may be circumstances when that is not proper, but I am unclear why second successions are any more of a problem than first successions. Even if he believes that there could be circumstances when a second succession should not be automatic, will he at least consider removing from the legislation clause 98(1)(b) which refers to a joint tenant who has become a sole tenant? That is the first succession and removes the possibility of a second succession for a child. Subsection (1)(d) refers to someone who
	<br><blockquote><p>"became the tenant on the tenancy being vested in him on the death of the previous tenant".</p></blockquote>
Again, the child would not have the right to succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister try to find a form of wording allowing a child to succeed in those circumstances, irrespective of whether the parent who dies in the property is the original tenant or a successor tenant? It is an enormous problem for children now in their 30s, 40s and 50s, many of whom feel extremely vulnerable. They are worried about what will happen to them when their parents die. It is also extremely worrying for parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the Minister cannot accept my amendments this afternoon, I hope that he will agree to do something to address that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support everything that my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) has said. I have been a member of Newham council for about 12 years and at least once every three or four months throughout that period that precise problem has been raised. I should welcome a commitment from the Minister to change the legislation, either as proposed in the amendment or in a slightly different way. It is certainly a major problem, and it needs to be dealt with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. James Clappison)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if my rising to answer the debate disappoints the hon. Member for Attercliffe, in view of his comments about tea and so forth, because it removes one of the levers that he thought he had through his influence in the Tea Room and my hon. Friend the Minister's comments about gastronomic delights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman. First, the rights of introductory tenancies will, on most points, be the same as for secure tenants. The right of succession, particularly the right of first succession, is important for the reasons outlined by the hon. Gentleman. I am sure that he will accept that the first succession will cover many instances and be of assistance to many tenants. I shall spell it out. The right is the same as for secure tenants; certain people have the right to succeed to a tenancy on the death of the introductory tenant. The qualifications are that the successor should have occupied the tenant's house as his only or principle home at the time of the tenant's death and that he was the tenant's spouse or another member of the tenant's family and had lived with the tenant throughout the 12 months prior to the tenant's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0215">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>373</span>
death. However, as the hon. Gentleman said, succession can take place only once, so if the tenant himself was a successor, no one could succeed to the tenancy on his death. Amendment No. 273 would delete that qualification, and new clause 9 would do the same for secure tenancies. It would extend our proposals for introductory tenancies to secure tenancies and delete the qualification for both introductory and secure tenancies. That would be the overall effect of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Attercliffe mentioned something of the history of the matter. He may be familiar with the fact that before that rule was imposed in 1980, local authorities had more or less complete freedom about whether to allow someone to stay in a house when the tenant died. It was considered right at that time that some element of security should be offered to those who, for example, had been living with and looking after an elderly parent for some years only to find themselves without a home at an advanced age, as in the example given by the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Attercliffe raised potential difficulties about how far beyond the first succession we could go. That is where the problems start to arise. The hon. Gentleman also mentioned under-occupation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible to conceive of circumstances in which succession followed succession. To open the doors to that would be to open the doors to succession in perpetuity. That might be going too far, but it is certainly possible, even with the examples given by the hon. Gentleman. In his first example of a wife succeeding upon the death of her husband, that being the first succession, and there being adult offspring living in the house, the argument is that the son would lose out because his would be the second succession. However, under the amendment, if the son married and then died, there could be a third succession, followed by others if there were further marriages or grandchildren.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister puts a case that is potentially possible. It is far more unusual than in the cases in which I have been involved. Would the Minister reflect on the fact that, even if there was a second succession in such circumstances, the person who would have succeeded would already have lived there for 40 or 50 years. Would such a tenant be allowed to be removed from the property and evicted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is repeating a point that he made in his speech. The matter is open to consideration. Of course, the hon. Gentleman will accept that it could be open to a local authority to consider the needs of such a person and to consider making a fresh tenancy in that person's name. That is always possible. The hon. Gentleman accepts that there may be a problem with succession following succession and I am alive to that consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to the second example that he gave—a joint tenancy followed by a succession. I will reflect on what he said about mat. I can make no promises, but I will consider the matter carefully and see to what extent it runs foul of the problem of succession followed by succession. In considering the issue, I am influenced by the need to avoid succession
	<span class='label label-info column'>374</span>
followed by succession, which would cause difficulties for local authorities. I am also alive to the fact that it will be open to local authorities to create fresh tenancies. Without making any promises, I will think carefully about what the hon. Gentleman said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Under-Secretary is prepared to reflect on the matter, may I press him further? I realise that a local authority can use its discretion to create a new tenancy and let someone stay in it. That may be difficult, as it may lead to under-occupation of the premises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For many people, the worry and uncertainty about what will happen is a greater problem than what happens in practice. I hope that the Under-Secretary will consider the great advantages in changing the law to give people certainty, rather than just the hope that everything will be all right. It is extremely difficult, especially for someone who is terminally ill, to face the fact that what one had hoped would happen to the tenancy may not happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an extremely complex matter, and we understand the difficulties with which the Under-Secretary will have to wrestle. I am delighted to know that a legal brain will be doing the wrestling. I am also delighted to know that it will be done in English, because I hate to think what would happen if we decided to try to define the rights of succession in French, as the Minister might try to do. I was pondering on his earlier remark and wondering whether the 14 days would include a weekend, in which case we could use the term in English or French, no doubt causing deep offence to the Academie Francaise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the rights of succession, let us consider an illustration that reinforces the case. Suppose that two elderly people, a married couple, have lived in the home as joint tenants for a long time. Let us say that they have a middle-aged relative—a son or daughter—living with them, who suffers from a serious disability. I have dealt with examples of exactly that situation. They are in a very worrying position, knowing that that individual, who has depended on them for all his or her life and would probably have difficulty in finding alternative accommodation, would not be able to stay in their home it they, as joint tenants, died one after the other, thereby taking out the right of succession. The relative would lose the right of succession. There would be a perverse incentive for them to divorce or for one of them to leave, so that the right of succession would pass to their son or daughter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such examples occur in real life and all hon. Members come across them in their surgeries. That is why we are anxious to rationalise an extremely messy position. My hon. Friend the Member for Attercliffe made a powerful case for re-examining it, and the Under-Secretary responded in a generous spirit and said that he would do so. We all want to make progress, so we will not press the matter. We are delighted that he will reflect on it and we wish him well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a complex subject, which will be resolved only if there is a will to understand the human realities behind what seems a rather dry, academic formulation of the rights of succession. If we do not allow for human circumstances and if we do not provide for the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0216">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>375</span>
exceptions that create the injustices, we will undoubtedly go on getting in our surgeries and in our postbags examples of people who feel a genuine sense of grievance about the way in which the law currently operates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish challenged Conservative Members to be disloyal to the Government. My vote has been wholly reliable up to now, but I take exception to the Minister's remarks about my constituents in the Tea Room. I serve warning on the Minister and the Whip that I hope that Front-Bench Members will watch their language.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the Under-Secretary has agreed to reflect further on the issue of joint tenancies, which are now a more common form of tenancy. If the wording in the Housing Act 1985 and in clause 98 of the Bill remains, sons and daughters will not succeed to the family home, as there will always be a joint tenancy that will pass on to a sole tenant—one of the parents—so that the intention behind the Bill will not be realised. Close members of the family who live with tenants will never have the right to succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the Minister reflects on that, will he also reconsider cases in which the man, who is the sole tenant—that is still relatively common among older people—dies, the wife succeeds to the tenancy and there is a child who has lived in the property for a long time?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can hardly explain to the Minister how awful it is to have to explain to the tenants their situation. A woman in her 40s or early 50s had lived with and nursed her parents for some time. The parents were both in their 80s, and both of them fell ill. They were concerned about whether their daughter had a right to succeed. I said to the daughter, "The horrible thing I have to tell you is that, if your mother dies first, you have a right to succeed, because your father is the sole tenant. If your father dies first, your mother becomes the sole tenant and you don't have the right to succeed." That is not acceptable, so I hope that the Minister will also reflect on that and, if possible, find alternative wording for the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendments is to firm up clause 101 on the right to carry out repairs. The amendments would make the clause fair and reasonable to introductory tenants. The principle of introductory tenants is not too satisfactory, but the clause is especially unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a lengthy debate about how introductory tenants should be accommodated, and the Minister gave assurances that their interests would be safeguarded. Even this afternoon, he told us that it is always his intention to create a balance in matters involving tenants, and he said that he wanted to apply what is reasonable in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We propose to give introductory tenants the same right to repair as secure tenants. Section 121 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 inserted into the Housing Act 1985 section 96 which gives the Secretary of State power to make regulations to give secure tenants of local authorities the right to repair. The current regulations provide that, when a first contractor, which can be a local authority direct labour organisation, does not complete qualifying repairs within a specific time limit, the secure tenant has the right to require the landlord to appoint a second contractor to carry out the repairs. The tenant is also given the right to compensation if those repairs are not carried out within a specified time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no good reason why the introductory tenant should not have the same right to repair as the secure tenant. Both tenants are paying the same rent and the same contribution as part of that rent towards the repair fund. If the same right were not granted to introductory tenants, numerous difficulties might arise when, for example, repairs were ordered before the end of the 12 months of the introductory tenancy, but were not completed until that period was up, after which time the tenant became a secure tenant. An anomaly could arise out of the regulations. Clause 101 enables the Secretary of State to make regulations extending the right to repair to introductory tenants. The only sensible course for him to take would be to extend an identical right to repair to introductory tenants as applies to secure tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux advised us that it receives a substantial number
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0217">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>377</span>
of requests for advice from people each year. Last year, almost 750,000 people requested information on housing matters, a substantial number of whom had had their properties repossessed and were looking for council house tenancies. In emergencies, people are offered houses that, in the main, are in need of repair and decoration. People such as those described by NACAB are in no position not to accept the tenancies that are offered to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us imagine a family moving into a home where repairs are necessary, but which does not have the same right as a secure tenant to obtain the repairs. That is completely unfair. Introductory tenants should have the same rights as secure tenants. I refer to the report of the Wakefield housing committee of 25 January, when it reviewed decoration and disturbance allowances. It said that some of the properties that tenants had to take up were in need of decoration and repair. Therefore, Wakefield district housing department generously granted decoration allowances to regulated tenancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, such principles might not apply. It would be unfair if one tenant were offered a decoration allowance or had repairs done, while other tenants did not. No member of the Committee can say that that would be fair or justifiable. The amendment would firm up the proposals on the right to repairs. If we are to apply fairness and justice to all those whom we represent, introductory tenants should not be treated any less favourably than those who have assured tenancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister could explain why introductory tenants should not have the same rights to repairs, decoration allowances and so on as secure tenants, we would be prepared to listen. It is unacceptable to discriminate against introductory tenants. Therefore, the Minister should accept the constructive amendments, which would firm up clause 101, and ensure that justice was done across the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support the amendment. It leads directly back to some of today's opening debates. The neighbours of introductory tenants should not regard them differently and tell them, "If you are very, very good you can stay but, if we don't like any part of your behaviour, you will have to move." The clause could exacerbate that problem. It could make incoming tenants think that they were not trusted, and that they were expected to behave badly. It would give any neighbour who did not view their arrival favourably a subtle stick with which to beat them. There would be a double standard for tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In certain circumstances, local authorities could use the fact that tenants' rights differ to put on almost permanent hold some of their more difficult tenants. They might simply move them around estates year on year. In some instances, a property might deteriorate if a right to carry out repairs was not part of an introductory tenancy, as it is of a secured tenancy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the speeches of the hon. Members for Hampstead and —Highgate (Ms Jackson) and for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien). I shall assist the Committee on the points that they have raised.

	<span class='label label-info column'>378</span>
Clause 101 gives the Secretary of State the power under regulations to apply to introductory tenancies any provision relating to the right to repair that he has already applied to secure tenancies. The intention is that the right to repair will be applied to introductory tenancies in exactly the same way as it is now applied to secure tenancies. I hope that that deals with the points that have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton referred to firming up the provisions of clause 101. I am not sure that the amendment would do so. It is not a question of drafting. In any case, I hope that he will accept that it is our intention to apply the right to repair to both introductory and secured tenancies. Therefore, I invite him to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wanted to be sure that we were not including in the Bill discrimination between introductory and secure tenants. I accept the Under-Secretary's assurances that there will be no discrimination between the two types of tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 294 would remove the "may" that will apply to the Secretary of State. Too often, we give such powers to the Secretary of State and find that local authorities are put at a disadvantage because the Secretary of State has power over what they are entitled to apply, in this case, to their tenants, and, more generally, to council tax payers. In view of the assurances given to the Under-Secretary, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take new clause 20—	<i>Repairs</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any provision made under section 96 of the Housing Act 1985 (right to carry out repairs) shall apply to introductory tenants as to secure tenants.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the Minister's previous comments, I hope that he will feel inclined to accept the new clause. If his intention is as he said, new clause 20 would solve his problem. We have already discussed the matter; but I shall make one further argument to the Minister. As I understand it, the purpose of introductory tenancies is to tackle tenants' misbehaviour. There is therefore absolutely no reason why tenants who have introductory tenancies should be denied any rights that are available to secure tenants—most significantly, the right to buy. The argument is simple. In view of the Under-Secretary's comments, I hope that he will accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Committee will know, clause 101 proposes an important right for introductory tenants that already exists for secure tenants, who have enjoyed the right to repair since 1984.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Christchurch spoke to new clause 20 in a characteristically attractive and pleasant manner, but I am not inclined to accept it. I hope that she will reflect on the comments that I made about the

	<span class='label label-info column'>379</span>
intention behind the proposals when I spoke to previous amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the whole problem: if the Under-Secretary's intention is as he says, I can see no reason for not accepting the new clause. I am extremely disappointed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise only to question the Minister about the wording of clause 101. All of the proceeding clauses in this chapter repeat the word "shall" time and time again. For example:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The court shall make an order. … The Court shall not entertain proceedings";</p></blockquote>
or "The local authority shall" do such and such. Clause 101 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by regulations … apply to introductory tenants any provision made under that section in relation to secure tenants."</p></blockquote>
The reason why both main Opposition parties are suspicious is the difference in language. Suddenly a highly prescriptive Bill that reads "shall, shall, shall" reads "may". Obviously—we are not foolish—we suspect that that may be intended to achieve a slightly different effect to the emphatic, prescriptive "shall" elsewhere. That is why we pressed the Undersecretary—we are pleased to hear that he does not intend the discretion to be used to apply different standards to introductory tenants' right to repair from those applied to secure tenants, but can we have an explanation why the clause is phrased in different language? It looks as if it was written by a different civil servant to the one who drafted the other clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is worried about whether we intend to make regulations. He has drawn attention to the word, "may". I studied his amendments under the great disadvantage of doing so in legal English—the hon. Gentleman was too kind by far in what he said about legal English. If the hon. Gentleman studies his amendments, he will find that he used the word "any"—I think that I adverted to this point when responding to the reading of the drafting by the hon. Member for Normanton. That would have the same effect as using the word "may" in our version. Without having to dance on a pinhead in considering the finer points of drafting, I hope that the Committee will be assured of our intent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot resist coming back on that point. The Under-Secretary pointed out the word "any" in amendment No. 293, but he did not draw attention to the word "shall" in amendment No. 295. We are quite clear that "any regulations made by" the Secretary of State
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall apply to introductory tenants as they do"</p></blockquote>
to secure tenants. Our amendments were intended to make the language consistent with the rest of the Bill. I am sorry that the Under-Secretary felt that it was not so elegant a phrase as it should have been. We clearly need a course in legal English and we shall try to do better in the future. Nevertheless, we are pleased that the Undersecretary understands our purpose and that he has given us an assurance that the same standards will apply to both.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>380</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the jobs that I did in my past was teaching English as a foreign language. I spent many a long hour trying to teach people the difference between "shall" and "may". I regret that I have not managed to teach the Under-Secretary the difference. It is possible that in the future we may not have Ministers who are so generous in their intentions, and tenants could find that their repairs are not done if the Bill stands as drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 256, in page 58, line 38, leave out from "land" to end of line 39 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"which would not be treated as part of a dwelling-house for the purposes of Part IV of the Housing Act 1985 (see section 112(2) of that Act)".</p></blockquote>
This is a purely technical amendment designed to meet the requirements of the European directives on the use of imperial measurements such as acres. For ease of reference clause 104 is amended to refer to the equivalent power in section 112(2) of the Housing Act 1985. As one who is fond of the expression "acres", I commend the amendment to the Committee without conspicuous enthusiasm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot resist the opportunity to challenge the Under-Secretary. Are we to believe that the perfectly adequate phrasing of clause 104(2) will be altered simply to comply with directives from Brussels? If so, can we ascertain the views of the Under-Secretary's right hon. and hon. Friends? He suggested that he had a lack of enthusiasm for moving the amendment and I suspect that were the hon. Member for Southend, East (Mr. Taylor) present, or one or two other hon. Members with similar views, he would be hearing rather different comments. We would probably be here for the rest of the evening and you would have to pull us back to order very quickly, Mrs. Winterton. It is somewhat depressing to have to change our legislation where it refers to the General Rate Act 1967 and the words "exceeding two acres". Presumably we now have to express it in hectares. Before long, we will probably have to express it in French, which will no doubt please the Minister, who will be able to show is bilingual approach to life, but the rest of us will be very sceptical indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot resist the opportunity to question why the Government amendment is necessary. Why is subsection (2) of clause 104 necessary? Subsection (1) is understandable. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of this Chapter a dwelling-house may be a house or part of a house."</p></blockquote>
We understand that entirely, but subsection (2) is about land. If the Minister is saying that someone could be granted an introductory tenancy on a piece of land that is not part of a dwelling, where he or she may pitch his
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0219">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>381</span>
or her tent—or even sleep rough—that might explain the reference, but I hope that that is not its purpose. I hope that the Government are not suggesting that people might be found without a roof over their heads; but if they do have a roof over their heads, what is the purpose of the reference to land separate from dwelling houses? I fail to understand its relevance and significance. I hope that the Minister can enlighten us. There may be good reasons for the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that I have to keep the debate going to allow the Minister to be briefed, so I shall reveal some of my weekend researches into "Henry IV, Part 1". The Minister tempted me sorely last week by referring to that excellent Shakespeare play, so I could not resist reacquainting myself with it. In it, Sir John Falstaff makes a wonderful comment on the effect of the Government's housing policies, particularly on the housing market. In act II, scene IV, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You may buy land now as cheap as stinking mackerel".</p></blockquote>
That is not a nice concept. Perhaps the cheapness of the land has some relevance to the Minister's response. I look forward to hearing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can assist the hon.

Clause 105 is purely technical; it defines a family member for the purposes of this chapter. It follows the definition in the Housing Act 1985.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are similar to each other and amend clauses 108,111,115 and 116. Clauses 108 and 111 will enable a landlord to evict a nuisance tenant for behaviour that is likely to cause nuisance or annoyance. That will enable a third party rather than the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0220">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>383</span>
victim of the behaviour to give evidence against the perpetrator. Clauses 115 and 116 attach a power of arrest for breach of injunctions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clauses that strengthen the grounds for possession and allow a power of arrest to be attached to injunctions involving anti-social behaviour enjoy the support of local authorities and other social landlords. The purpose of the Government's amendments is to make even more clear than the Bill does already that our aim is to provide for third-party witnesses, such as a local authority officer or a professional witness, to give evidence. That approach is already being used successfully by some local authorities, such as Sunderland. The amendments substitute the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"conduct causing or likely to cause a nuisance"</p></blockquote>
for the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"conduct which was, or is likely to have been, a nuisance".</p></blockquote>
In other words, we are substituting words that are easier to judge. These are essentially clarificatory amendments, which I commend to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's aim is that landlords should be able to obtain possession in some cases on evidence from third parties who are not victims. In the interests of fairness, the anti-social behaviour must be causing a nuisance to others or be likely to do so. We have already rehearsed in Committee the extent to which the fear of intimidation of potential witnesses is a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 276 would remove the third-party witness provision, which would not be welcomed by landlords. The hon. Member for Christchurch may have tabled the amendment for fear that unless evidence comes directly from a victim, a tenant may be evicted on flimsy information. That will not be the case. Final jurisdiction remains with the court, which will weigh up the evidence from both sides. The hon. Lady should not fear that the use of third-party evidence will lead to innocent tenants being evicted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I covered that amendment, Mrs. Winterton, along with the Government amendments to which it relates, because I thought that it would be convenient for the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has already referred to my amendment. I am concerned that landlords could obtain possession orders where there are unsubstantiated allegations. There have been cases in which that happened. One that was brought to my attention involved a district council that obtained an eviction order against a family with five children from a house in a small village. A petition was signed by many people in the village against the planned eviction, on the basis that the full facts of the case had not been taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Almost all the evidence against the family consisted of witness statements by one family and a couple of their friends, and was uncorroborated. Many people in the village stated that the family threatened with eviction were good neighbours. They also stated that they had been approached by a woman who supported the eviction and who had written to the council asking it to get rid of the family. Despite the petition, the authority refused to call off the proposed eviction and stated that the family would be found intentionally homeless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>384</span>
There is thus evidence that abuses sometimes occur. I am a little disappointed with the Minister's view. It is clearly possible for people to be evicted without substantiated evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government amendments in this group do the same as the Opposition amendments, but they do it more comprehensibly. The Opposition want to define "vicinity" in more precise terms. We have come to the conclusion that we need a better word than "vicinity", so we have introduced the concept of locality. The hon. Gentleman's concerns will be embraced by the use of the word "locality".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 259, 266, 269, 270 and 272 are identical and rectify the fact that we felt that we had not cast the net wide enough in the original clauses, when we restricted anti-social behaviour to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the vicinity of the dwelling-house".</p></blockquote>
"Vicinity" means neighbourhood, and could be construed as applying to close neighbours. It might not cover, for example, behaviour by a tenant on a large estate towards tenants on a further part of the estate. We want to be able to cover as wide an area as possible, while maintaining the link between the tenant's behaviour and the fact that he lives in the area. "Locality" is our preferred replacement for that, and is designed to catch such behaviour over that larger area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is in the spirit of clauses 108 and 111, which strengthen the existing grounds for possession based on nuisance and annoyance in the case of both secure and assured tenancies.

Opposition amendments Nos. 297 and 316 attempt to extend and define "vicinity", but I believe that our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0221">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>385</span>
amendments, by not attempting to give a specific definition to the area that we want to cover, give us a flexibility that those amendments would not allow. I assure Opposition Members that our amendments are intended to cover all the areas set out in their amendments—the common parts of blocks of flats, other parts of the estate and even parts of the locality that may not have the same landlord as the tenants so long as the behaviour takes place in the locality of the dwelling house. I therefore commend the Government amendments to the Committee. I believe that they make the Opposition's amendments redundant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 297 and 316, notwithstanding what the Minister said. I welcome the change of the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"the vicinity of the dwelling-house"</p></blockquote>
to "locality". I agree with the Minister that it gives a broader scope in applying the clause. However, I believe that mere should be further clarification of what is meant. First, if the problem arises in a block of flats, our amendments seek to make it explicit that the locality embraces any other flat in that block. It is unclear whether "locality" includes every other flat in the block, but our amendment would make it explicit. The term "locality" would lead to much discussion about what the word embraced. We want to make it clear that it would include every other flat in the block and we want to be sure that everywhere on an estate would be included. Without those specific clarifications there is a danger that "locality" could be interpreted too narrowly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It appears to me that the definition of "vicinity" implies nearness. I think that the Minister accepts that there might be a problem. Would he at least consider how far "locality" relates to a place name? In my constituency, three local authority areas come close together, one of them having two sets of council property side by side. The behaviour of the council tenants on one side of the boundary has a direct effect on council tenants on the other side. At the back of my mind I have the feeling that "locality" would mean either the Reddish part of my constituency, or the Denton part, but not both. How far is "locality" associated with the name of a place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a danger in tussling over definitions. From the sometimes painful experience of local government reviews, I know how often local government boundaries go right down the middle of a street or appear to defy any topographical factor—at least ones that are modest. Any problem raised by "locality" would, in practice, also be raised by "vicinity". If anyone can think of a better definition than "locality" or "vicinity", I would be open to it, but I cannot find one and "locality" is what I prefer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Timms) that the amendment will include every other flat in the block. That is what is meant by the word "locality". It will also include the rest of the estate. As I have said already, the tenants might not have the same landlord, so we intend to embrace such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>386</span>
It would be absurd if someone could commit all sorts of nuisance against a neighbour and escape by virtue of the fact that that he happened to be the other side of a local authority boundary which ran down the white line in the middle of the road. I give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks. I hope that the Committee considers that the formulation that the Government have reached is the best bet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the Minister has opened a can of worms. He has conceded that that there might be similar difficulties with the word "locality" as there are with the word "vicinity". Recognising the difficulties and potential problems, we tried to define the word "vicinity" in such a way as to give absolute clarity—as my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East emphasised when speaking to the amendment—and avoid any doubt. The Minister has confirmed that his interpretation of the word "locality" includes that to which we referred when speaking to amendment No. 297, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>'"the vicinity of the dwelling house' shall include: … where the dwelling house is part of a block of flats, any other part of the same block of flats; and … where the dwelling house is situated on an estate, any other part of the same estate".</p></blockquote>
That was clear, and it was designed to demonstrate that the word "vicinity" should have the wider interpretation that we want. Although the Minister is satisfied that that will be the case with the word "locality", I am not sure that that will necessarily be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall use two analogies. The word "locality" could be used in relation to this building. Earlier, there was an interesting discussion about the Tea Room. If one were to talk of the locality of the Tea Room, people would think of a rather small area within the Palace of Westminster. However, the right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South rightly referred to his constituents who work in the Tea Room whose skills and culinary expertise were cast in doubt by the Minister. If the right hon. Gentleman were to talk about the locality of Westminster, we would have a rather broader view of the meaning of the word. He could mean anywhere in this part of Westminster, or anywhere in the city of Westminster. I am not sure where the city boundary is, but I know that the locality of the Tea Room means something different from the locality of Westminster. I suspect that the word that the Minister has chosen to use is ambiguous, so I ask him to reflect a little more on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister asked whether we could suggest an alternative. In the spirit of compromise and of proposing improvements to the Bill, I suggest the word "neighbourhood". There is little doubt that that word means more than just one particular block or building. It would include a wider group of areas, and it would include the neighbours. As many of today's debates have dealt with the problems caused by people whose anti-social behaviour terrorises their neighbours and causes problems in the neighbourhood, that might be the right word to use to describe the area in which the Bill should prevail.

	<span class='label label-info column'>387</span>
clarity prompted by the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East and the Minister's willingness to consider alternatives leads me to think that the matter requires further thought. Perhaps we should be talking about neighbourhoods, rather than using the words "vicinity" and "locality". I shall be most interested to hear the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There comes a moment when we must apply a certain amount of common sense. I advise the hon. Gentleman to put his worms back in the can. No matter which word we were to choose, we could argue about its application. We tried the word "neighbourhood", thought that it did not work and dismissed it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because it could be defined too narrowly. Members of the Committee keep referring to their constituencies, so I shall do so for once. There are a number of estates between Skipton and Keighley. People from one estate complain about the behaviour of people from other estates. They are not the same estates—they are divided by the Aire valley road, which is a major delineator. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I shall not be tempted. In a constituency with the Pennines running down the middle, I realise the different characteristics of people according to which valley they came from. There can be no logical definition. The people from one estate would not regard people in an estate on the other side of the Aire valley road as being their neighbours. It is as simple as that. The term "vicinity" is narrowly defined, but "locality" is as near as we can get to the purposes of the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the word "locality" used in any other legislation and if so, how has it been applied? Is there any evidence from the courts to assure us that the definition that the Minister is now suggesting works in practice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know the answer to that. Had I known that we would get into this sort of debate, I would have asked for a lawyer to deal with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has highlighted the problem. If we, as non-lawyers, are having difficulty, what will the lawyers do with the definition when people start trying to dispute it? I have considerable sympathy with the amendments spoken to by the hon. Member for Newham, North-East, because we all realise the potential problems. The intention seems to be to make things progress quickly—I mentioned this morning that I can foresee problems in other areas. If we are not careful, the courts will have a heyday and cases will go on for ever. I urge the Minister to revisit the matter with some lawyers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I come back to where I started. There comes a time when one has to decide, and I believe that we should agree on the word "locality". If we try to be precise and define everything, we will inevitably miss something out and the legislation will prevent us from doing it. We want an all-embracing term that common sense people understand. As every member of the Committee, by definition, has common sense, I cannot understand the difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is general support for an additional ground for possession for offences of domestic violence. We all know from our surgeries and correspondence about the many instances of horrific and sad cases of violence in the family and the destruction that that causes, but, there are many problems to be addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We make it absolutely clear that we do not condone such violence in any way. We are opposed to it and want to ensure that the law deals with it adequately. It is not merely an issue of violence affecting people in the household; violence often erupts into widespread neighbour problems. A few weeks ago, I received a delegation of a group of neighbours from my constituency who were fed up with the windows of a house being smashed time after time. Boards would go up, the glaziers would come, but the same thing would happen the following week. Although such cases are not commonplace, they are frequent enough, and we should reflect on the fact that they lower the tone of the neighbourhood and add to the problems of other people who live in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authority housing stock is also affected. In all too much instances, the man inflicts violence on the woman and the local authority can ensure that the possession of the house remains with the woman and the children only by persuading her to get the courts to agree to exclude the man from the tenancy. That is a difficult process. It is often impossible to persuade the woman to go to court, as she may be so frightened that all she wants is to get out of the house and away from the problem. In such circumstances, there is little that the authority can do other than accept that the man will remain in the family home, which is often a nice, large house. The authority must then supply two family homes to what used to be one family. That is another problem that the clause must deal with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not convinced that the Government have got the matter absolutely right. We believe that they can
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0223">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>389</span>
strengthen the provision. Amendment No. 299 is all-embracing, and deals with the two aspects on which we believe that the Government have not gone far enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the clause is narrow. It deals with violence in the house inflicted by one partner on the other partner or the child of that partner, but there are other circumstances in which violence may occur that should be covered by grounds for possession. For example, a household might consist of a man and wife with an elderly relative, such as the mother of the wife. If the man was being violent to the mother-in-law, the local authority might want to act, but would be unable to take possession of the property under the narrow terms of the clause, even if the wife and mother had been driven out. Amendment No. 299 would enable action to be taken in such circumstances. Moreover, households may not consist of the normal family relationships as envisaged by the Government, and the clause does not seem to cover a same-sex relationship in a household.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that there are a number of circumstances in which violence can occur in a household and where an authority wants to take action because people who had a right to occupy a house were driven out. As defined in the clause, there are only limited circumstances in which grounds for possession apply—where one partner has been violent to the other partner or the child of that partner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason why we believe that the clause is too narrow is that it refers only to violence and not to the threat of violence. It is difficult on occasions to be precise about the threat of violence, but in some cases it is obvious that the threats are real. Threats can be heard by neighbours, for example. A major row might break out in the front garden, and although the man does not bash his wife over the head with a stick, he nevertheless threatens to. That would be clear evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 299 would ensure that the clause covered the threat of violence as well as actual violence. The Government should take account of that, as it is a very real issue. We should not wait until violence occurs. If the threat of violence is real, there should be grounds to take action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In case the Government are not prepared to accept amendment No. 299, we have also tabled amendments Nos. 301 and 300, which the Government could accept, because they are a little less comprehensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 301 again adds the threat of violence to the grounds for possession. The Government could accept it if they did not want to allow more members of a household to be subject to the provision that violence would give grounds for possession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 300 raises the problem of dwelling houses being
	<br><blockquote><p>"more extensive than is reasonably required".</p></blockquote>
We do not understand why paragraph (d), which would be removed by the amendment, has been included. If someone has been violent in such a way that grounds for possession exist, those grounds ought to exist
	<span class='label label-info column'>390</span>
irrespective of whether the person concerned is living in a small or large property. It is peculiar for the Government to be prepared to allow grounds for possession only where an individual is under-occupying it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, if a man beat his wife and his wife had to leave, the local authority would have grounds for possession if the couple happened to have lived in a two-bedroom property but not if they had lived in a one-bedroom flat—that is entirely possible—and the wife had to flee the property because of violence. The man would be entitled to occupy a one-bedroom property. Of course, the local authority would still have to find two properties, and someone else on the housing list would be pushed down the list because of that man's violence toward his wife.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We tabled the amendments in the hope that the Government would accept amendment No. 299, which, as I say, is more comprehensive, because it would allow violence to other members of the family to be treated as grounds for possession. It would also include the threat of violence and remove the provision that a property must be
	<br><blockquote><p>"more extensive than is reasonably required"</p></blockquote>
before grounds for possession exist. If the Government do not want to go that far, they can accept amendments Nos. 301 and 300, but we hope that they will accept the lead amendment, because the issues are important and should be addressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support amendment No. 300 in particular. Many members of the Committee—and, it appears, the Government—are in principle in favour of not tolerating domestic violence, which is what the clause is all about. The clause undermines that principle by relying on the fact that the person carrying out the violence is under-occupying. We should be firm and say that domestic violence is unacceptable and is grounds to remove someone from a property. We should be quite clear about that with no "ifs" or "buts".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendments and strongly endorse the comments of the hon. Member for Christchurch. We should be absolutely clear that domestic violence is not and should not be tolerated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question that I wanted to raise concerns what is regarded as violence. In a family with three children in my constituency, the husband—although he worked and maintained the family—was an alcoholic. It was not unknown for him to come home at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning and decide that that was the perfect time to cook a pan of chips. On more than one occasion, he fell asleep while the chips were cooking and a fire that could have been serious and taken lives was stopped just in time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third time that such an incident occurred, it was too much for his wife, who was justifiably concerned for the safety of her children. She removed herself from the family home and was deemed to have made herself voluntarily homeless—which was utterly absurd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly endorse the amendments, because the variables of human relationships are many, but the bottom line for us as legislators should be that the person who commits the violence or who issues violent
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0224">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>391</span>
threats and, on occasions, engages others to take part in acts of violence should be removed, not the victims.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo what the hon. Lady said. Sometimes, the way in which people behave is unfathomable. Partners have still got back together even when one of them has experiencd severe violence. That is truly amazing to anyone looking at such matters from the outside. People say, "Why on earth did she do it?"—or in some cases, it could be he.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not often.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not often, but I did not wish to give the impression that I was not embracing all possibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our new ground for possession in the event of domestic violence deals with a situation in which a married couple or a couple who are living together as husband and wife occupy a dwelling, when one or both of them is a tenant. It will apply when one partner has left the dwelling because of the violence of the other towards that partner or his or her child and when the court is satisfied that the partner who has left the dwelling is unlikely to return and the house is larger than the remaining partner needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition amendments Nos. 299, 301 and 300 have different aims. Amendment No. 299 would delete the Government's proposed new ground for possession in cases of domestic violence and substitute a different ground. It would apply to any person living as a member of the same household as the tenant who has left and who is unlikely to return because of violence or threats of violence towards him or another household member by the person remaining. Clearly, amendment No. 299 is a great deal wider than the Government's proposed new ground for possession. It seems to exclude the possibility of the tenant being the perpetrator or, indeed, the victim of the domestic violence. The amendment is badly flawed and I am unable to commend it to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 301 is an alternative approach to amendment No. 299. It would amend the Government's proposed new ground for possession only by introducing the notion of "threats of violence". It would require the landlord to judge whether the alleged perpetrator was likely to carry out the threats of violence, which would impose a considerable judgmental burden on the landlord. I expect that housing managers would be somewhat reluctant to assume such a requirement and to attempt to make such a judgment. I cannot commend the amendment to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, amendment No. 300 is more persuasive. It would retain the bulk of the Government's proposed new ground and would remove the paragraph that confines possession to a situation in which the remaining partner is under-occupying the dwelling. I shall consider sympathetically the spirit of the amendment in the event of it being withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify one point? I recently had a case in my constituency in which the son returned to the family home after a term in a psychiatric hospital. He perpetrated violence against his parents who had to leave the family home while he remains
	<span class='label label-info column'>392</span>
there. Amendment No. 299 would have covered that situation. I accept that it may be poorly drafted and that there will always be ways in which such amendments can be improved, but how does the Minister intend to respond to such circumstances if the clause remains, even if he accepts amendment No. 300?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has put himself in a difficult position. One of his arguments against amendment No. 301 to which my hon. Friend the Member for Attercliffe spoke was that it would be difficult for a landlord to decide whether it was likely that the threat of violence would be carried out. I refer him to clause 138 of his Bill. It deals with the circumstances in which people should be construed as being homeless. Clause 138(1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is not reasonable for a person to continue to occupy accommodation if it is probable that occupation of it will lead to violence from some other person residing in it or to threats of violence from some other person residing in it and likely to carry out the threats."</p></blockquote>
Those are the Minister's own words in his own Bill. If he believes it proper for local authorities to form a judgment about the likelihood of people perpetrating sexual violence under clause 138, I cannot for the life of me see why it is not possible under clause 109, amended by amendment No. 299, for local authorities to form a view on whether a threat of violence would be likely to be carried out. The Minister's defence of his position was not credible. I ask him to reconsider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have said that amendment No. 299 does not do what the Opposition want. I have also said that I find myself in sympathy with amendment No. 300. In considering what I would substitute for that amendment, I am willing to consider the point raised by others, including the hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson), about the case of a son. I assume that the son would not in that case be the tenant and the council could therefore evict him. I am willing to consider those points and bring back an effective amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the Minister has tried to respond to us. I am pleased that he appears to want to go along with amendment No. 300 and take out the under-occupation requirement, which seems to be out of place in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand why the Minister has used the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"who was likely to carry them out"</p></blockquote>
in other parts of the Bill. Local authorities have to make such judgments on a daily basis and it is obvious that they cannot make the same judgment under another set of circumstances. My hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich made a good point on that, but the Minister has not answered it. Perhaps there is no answer. The Government ought to accept the amendment, which is based on their words in another part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing with domestic violence. From his wide experience, the hon. Gentleman knows that making judgments about domestic violence is trickier than it is with other forms of violence. How many cases has he had in his constituency in which people have invited the police to intervene, but the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>393</span>
police have been reluctant to do so because the issue was domestic? That is where my reluctance stems from. I am considering coming back with some equivalent to amendment No. 300. I shall seek to cover the points that he has raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that the Minister will come back to the issue of sexual violence. My hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich referred to clause 138(1), which is about violence in the household. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is not reasonable for a person to continue to occupy accommodation if it is probable that occupation of it will lead to violence from some other person residing in it or to threats of violence from some other person residing in it and likely to carry out the threats".</p></blockquote>
That is precisely about domestic violence. The wording
	<br><blockquote><p>"likely to carry out the threats"</p></blockquote>
was drawn from there. I hope that the Minister will look seriously at the issue of sexual violence and incorporate our new wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, too, that the Minister will consider the issues raised by amendment No. 299. He may be correct to say that the amendment is so widely drawn that it could include two people in a house who were being violent to each other but were not tenants. In some cases, a tenant might be caught up in such a situation and served with grounds for possession. I do not think that that is the most likely type of case, but there are cases, such as a same-sex relationship, in which a mother might be caught in the violence rather than a child. Indeed, it might even be a grandchild who is caught. A man and wife might be tenants and have a grandchild on whom the violence is being inflicted by the grandfather. The possibility is not common, but it exists. I hope that such issues will be reflected on when the Minister brings an alternative wording.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to speak again, but the Minister commented that the police sometimes did not go into cases of domestic violence because they felt that it was not appropriate. That is no longer the case. Domestic violence is now taken more seriously by everyone, including the police. That is why it should be included in the Bill. Other legislation is coming forward and I regret that it did not come earlier. It is a serious problem and I hope that the Minister will look a little more widely into the subject and reflect that most people believe that we should do something about it. We should not pretend that we cannot interfere. The Housing Bill should reflect that view, which is widely held by many groups.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, should like to record my concern at the Minister's remarks that police forces disregarded acts of violence perpetrated by family members in a domestic environment as being domestic and therefore not a cause for their concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that; I said that there is sometimes a reluctance to get involved because of what the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the Minister said, but I wish to put it on record that the police in my part of London respond properly. Great strides have been made, circumstances and manpower permitting. Although police forces are overstretched and undermanned, the Metropolitan police force has met the need to change the police mind set of what constitutes domestic violence. The fact is that domestic violence occurs behind someone's front door and sometimes spills out into the front garden or onto the street. It is carried out by family members, but it is not always husband against wife or wife against husband; it can be parent against child or vice versa. Such acts of violence would not be tolerated in other situations and should not be tolerated in domestic situations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"The tenant or a person residing in the dwelling house has been convicted of an offence under section 4 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (production or supply of controlled drugs) and that offence was committed in the dwelling house or within the vicinity of the dwelling house."</p></blockquote>
A wide degree of concern is shared across the political spectrum about the abuse of drugs and the problems faced by many communities whose lives are literally put at risk and whose peace of mind is shattered by the activities of drug dealers using their areas, then-localities and their estates as a base for peddling their wares. Everyone wants to see effective action taken against such people. They are right to want effective action, and we have a duty to ensure that landlords and the police have the ability to take effective action against such people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key point that I should stress about the new ground of misuse of drugs is that it would arise out of conviction in a criminal court. It would arise only when someone had been convicted; it could not be used to turn someone out of his or her home purely on the basis of suspicion. The provision would not apply to someone simply convicted of possession of drugs. Whatever people think about that, the new clause has been drafted to cover only those people convicted of the production or supply of drugs. It is aimed at the pushers not the occasional consumer of drugs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision would apply when the offence has taken place in the dwelling or in its vicinity or neighbourhood. People would not be subject to a double jeopardy. If someone was convicted of dealing in drugs in a different part of the country, he would not lose his home. In such cases, the offence committed is entirely unrelated to the area in which the person lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The offence would have to be committed by the tenant or another person resident in the dwelling house. The new clause would not apply to a visitor. One can imagine circumstances in which a visitor might visit an area and try to sell drugs there and action could be taken by the police. Under chapter III of part V of the Bill, there may also be scope to take injunctive action against the visitor, but the tenant would not be liable to lose his home unless he were actively involved in the production, supply or sale of the drugs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>396</span>
The new clause contains the necessary safeguards. The new ground is mandatory and tough and it means that people who are found guilty of peddling drugs will lose their tenancies—it is right that they should.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 17 would introduce an expedited procedure to go with new clause 16. When possession is sought under the ground outlined in new clause 16—confusingly that becomes ground 17 under grounds for possession—there would be an expedited procedure to ensure that a neighbourhood is protected against the activities of the person involved. That person would not be able to behave in such a way for a long time while the case trundles through legal procedures. I stress again that that procedure will apply only when people have been convicted of an offence relating to the production, supply or sale of drugs. The problems identified when we spoke this morning of cases in which the innocent might become the victim of expedited procedures would not apply under the new clause. Expedited procedures will apply only to those who have been convicted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 304, 305, 306 and 317 are consequential on the new clauses, and I do not intend to say any more about them. However, I wish to stress the purpose behind the measures and the reasons why the Committee should accept them and include them in the Bill. We have a duty to make it absolutely clear that the supply of drugs from a council dwelling will result in eviction if a criminal conviction is obtained. People outside expect to hear that tough message from us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also make it clear that the courts must speed up the hearings of possession actions when these offences have been committed. It is not acceptable for local communities to go on enduring the behaviour of someone who has been convicted of an anti-social activity, but who can live in the community for several months while the normal, slow possession proceedings trundle through the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Drug abuse is a growing national problem and drug dealers operating on many council estates are a fundamental nuisance and a threat to the peace of mind, well-being and lives of many decent citizens. We owe it to those people to protect them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many local authorities are doing their best to take action within the existing legislative framework. There have been several attempts—some successful—to get possession on the grounds that people had been using their council homes for drug dealing or manufacture. Some authorities have inserted in their tenancy agreements clauses relating to the supply of drugs, but when possession is sought against the tenant on the ground that the tenancy agreement has been breached, it is always necessary to convince the court not just that there has been a breach of the tenancy agreement, but that it is reasonable to grant possession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would change that by making possession mandatory, once it had been established that the person had used that dwelling or the area around it for the production or sale of drugs. There would be no question of the court having the discretion to decide whether that was reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am somewhat unhappy about what my hon. Friend is saying. First, does he believe that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>397</span>
someone occupying a private house should be treated differently from someone who lives in a council house? Secondly, if the court is about to pass sentence on someone who is an owner-occupier, should the sentence be harsher than a sentence on someone who lives in a council house, because the owner-occupier will not lose his right to the house, whereas the council tenant will not only suffer the penalty from the court, but will lose his right to a tenancy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point, but it is not necessarily the case that the owner-occupier would not lose his or her house. If the owner-occupier suffered a custodial sentence and did not have the means to repay the mortgage, he or she could well lose the house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment does not seek to impose a double jeopardy—to penalise someone twice. It seeks to ensure that where someone's behaviour has not only involved a criminal offence, but has been damaging to the community and the area, he should not be free to go on creating hell for others living in the area. That is the reasonable concern on which people expect us to take action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible, as my hon. Friend suggested, that a court might reach the view that someone who had been convicted of the offence of peddling drugs has suffered a sufficient penalty, and that there was therefore no case for him to lose his tenancy as well. If the court reached such a conclusion, it would cause intense anger and iritation to all the people living in the area who had endured misery, horrors and unhappiness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have one concern. A person could be convicted of a drug offence, although no one living in the area had been bothered by what had gone on. In such a case, should the person be removed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The specific offence relates to the use of the premises or die locality surrounding the premises for the production and supply of drugs. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the people living there would be only too well aware of what was going on, but I accept the hon. Lady's point. There may be circumstances in which no one in the area would be aware, because the people purchasing the drugs would all have come from another area and would have caused no nuisance to people living on the estate. That is pretty far-fetched, but it could happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, I imagine that no complaint would reach the local authority, requesting it to seek possession. Unless the local authority kept a very close watch on proceedings in the criminal courts and automatically cross-checked them against its tenancy records, it would have no basis for taking action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing the position in the real world, where such activities cause intense unhappiness and anxiety to large numbers of people who fear for their children's lives and safety, who fear for their community, who are often intimidated and who simply want the freedom to be able to lead their lives peacefully and quietly without such people living in their area and peddling their vile trade.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend goes to the heart of the matter. I talked this morning about some of the estates that I represent. The Buttershaw estate in Bradford has become the drugs capital of West Yorkshire. Children as young as 10 or 11 are being given drugs by dealers who are known to the police. The local authority receives petition after petition asking for those people to be removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point. Any hon. Member who has had dealings with tenants groups or representatves—there was an impressive meeting in the House of Commons a few weeks ago, to which tenants from a number of estates brought their concerns—knows the real anxiety, fear and horror that many of those communities experience because of the disgusting behaviour of a small number of vile people, who peddle their drugs, which constitute a threat to the lives and well-being of the whole community. They want tough action, and we will let them down if we do not ensure that there is tough action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The front page of today's 	<i>Evening Standard</i> carries a story that I anticipated this morning when I referred to the preview on the "Today" programme. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government moved today to take the toughest action yet against the drug dealers infesting Britain's council estates—with a demand for them to be kicked out of their homes."</p></blockquote>
That is, verbatim, the front-page, lead story this afternoon. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Councils across the country are to be told to follow the lead of some big city authorities to evict convicted drug sellers. The call came from Home Office minister Tom Sackville during a strong attack on the drug culture fuelling much of Britain's crime.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>He told a crime prevention conference in Leicester it was wrong that drug dealers 'should be supported in their activities by public provision of housing while seeking to corrupt local children for personal gain'.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>He added: 'Drug dealers are the lowest of the low. I have heard of cases in which dealers brazenly ply their trade from council flats, yet return to leafy suburban homes to live. Those convicted of drug dealing who live in a council house or flat should be evicted at once. I am glad to hear a number of councils are doing just that.'"</p></blockquote>
Other points follow from that, but I shall not say more, as the point is clear—whatever the view of Ministers in the Committee, the view of the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department was that those guilty of drug-related offences should be evicted without delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, it is not as easy as that. Under existing law, it is not always possible for councils to get possession orders. We have already discussed the issue of whether courts consider the request reasonable. In some cases, the court would not consider it reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also questions about defining the nature of the offence. If people are guilty of manufacturing and selling drugs in their own homes, it is easier for a local authority to establish that those homes have been used for an illegal purpose, and there may also be other elements in the tenancy agreement that enable the authority to establish that those people have broken the agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if they have been plying their trade around the estate and not in the home, it will be difficult to prove that the home has been used for an illegal
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0228">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>399</span>
purpose. Again, that might constitute a real problem in getting a possession order through the court. Many local authorities are telling us that they cannot automatically get possession orders in such cases. Many tenants groups are also crying out for a clearer, more concise and more effective measure that can be used against people who—I stress—have been convicted not just of possessing drugs but of either manufacturing or selling those drugs in that locality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give me an assurance about what is likely to happen to the children or partners of individuals who face such penalties? I am not sure that the sins of the adult should necessarily be visited on the partner or the children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an important point, which applies equally to families of other people who are evicted from their homes for reasons other than breaches of tenancy agreements. The normal requirement of existing homelessness legislation, with which we shall deal in due course, is that there is an obligation under which homeless people fall into a priority group if they have children. It might be construed that they have made themselves intentionally homeless as a result of such an eviction, in which case the social services would be responsible for their children under the Children Act 1989.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the social services and the housing authority would discuss what would be the most appropriate solution to ensure that those children were not left on the streets. It would be completely unacceptable for children to be left on the streets in such circumstances. Clearly, it depends on the circumstances whether the housing authority would provide accommodation or alternative arrangements would be made. The important point is that the community that has suffered from the behaviour of someone carrying on a vile trade in their midst, terrorising their community, would get some relief, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe) said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, there is an overwhelming case for accepting new clauses 16 and 17.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the strength of what has been written today's 	<i>Evening Standard,</i> what we suggest is in line with Government policy. I look forward to the Minister's reply. Frankly, if the Minister were to reject the new clauses the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department would be guilty of double standards. If he is saying that action must be taken against drug dealers in such circumstances, we agree with him, and the new clauses would enable more effective action to be taken. If the Minister were to reject the new clauses, we would question whether the Government are saying one thing, but doing another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that will not be so and that the Minister will accept the new clauses and incorporate them in the Bill. That will reassure communities that feel desperately threatened by the evil of drug dealing. It will give a clear message that such activities will not be tolerated and that the toughest possible action will be taken against the perpetrators.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the endearing things about the hon. Gentleman is that one can see his perorations
	<span class='label label-info column'>400</span>
coming from such a long way away, and one knows how they will end. I have no doubt he will lay many things at my door. I cannot recall all the countless human miseries that he has attributed to me during the proceedings of the Committee. However, I have broad shoulders and, no doubt, I can take a few more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the comments of Opposition Members, it is clear that there is an undercurrent of unease, which I share, at the idea of introducing mandatory expulsion in that one circumstance. It is equally true that the Committee shares an abhorrence of the activity, and we want to do something about it. Therefore, I shall make three or four points. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department was applauding measures taken under the existing law. But we recognise that the law does not always operate as easily as we should like. It is not difficult to invoke the law but it is difficult to get it to deliver as effectively as people would like. So there is a case for doing something about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power to evict someone after regular proceedings with discretion, to which the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish referred, is different from a requirement to evict. We would have to face the consequences to which the hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) referred, and the hon. Member for Greenwich was honest enough to acknowledge that fact. So that should be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can all understand the specific mention of drug dealing, but if someone were not required to be evicted for murder or child molestation that inconsistency would have to be addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Judicial discretion might sound frightfully boring, as it were. However, in speaking to earlier amendments, the hon. Member for Greenwich was concerned that the court did not have the power to take the view, as it were, that he would want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore suggest to the hon. Gentleman that we seek to establish where we have common ground, but we must examine the questions that have been raised about the hon. Gentleman's proposed methodology. I undertake to examine the points that he has made and work out how we can use new clause 16 as the basis for producing more effective action. We shall obviously have to be careful about the definitions—how far a tenant's activities are linked to the fact that he resided in the area. We may be able to use ground 2 of the 1985 Act, which concerns nuisance and annoyance in a locality, to include some of those sorts of activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will understand that the question of moving to a mandatory sentence is one about which I should need to consult more widely, because it has implications for the operation of the judicial systems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Elletson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blackpool, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to hear what my hon. Friend has had to say and welcome the assurances that he has given. I am sure that he knows that many Conservative members of the Committee have considerable sympathy with the new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Greenwich. The problem is widespread—not just in inner cities but in many towns throughout the country. Council tenants on estates in my constituency want nothing less than the expulsion of people who have abused their tenancy by

	<span class='label label-info column'>401</span>
dealing in drugs. That measure would be popular and command a great deal of support. I hope that the Minister will take it extremely seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what my hon. Friend says, and I have a great deal of sympathy with him. However, I recall that the House has in the past acted in response to popular pressures and has lived to regret it, or discovered problems. That is why I have said that I am willing to examine the whole issue in the light of the new clause. Some serious issues must be considered and I am not prepared to come to a conclusion on the matter on the hoof—the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish will recognise that. I am as anxious as the hon. Gentleman to deliver on a problem that we all acknowledge exists. I am willing to try to find agreement on how we can deal with the matter in a way that sends a clear message to the outside world about what we feel about that sort of behaviour. If the hon. Gentleman will accept those assurances, and withdraw the amendment, I will undertake to pursue the matter urgently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested to hear what the Minister said. I want to counsel further caution. The Committee agrees that we would like far more mixed housing, and that it is not a good idea to have council estates here, housing association properties there and owner occupiers elsewhere. The more we encourage mixed ownership—something that the Government have pushed for—the more important it is that we treat people in different forms of ownership and tenancy in exactly the same way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A situation used to exist in my constituency that caused a great deal of anger and annoyance to tenants—anger that my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich expressed. Drug dealing went on in a block of flats that
	<span class='label label-info column'>402</span>
was used as a look out from which the whole estate could be surveyed. A telephone system was operated from that block of flats using a mobile phone. A house about 300 yards away was owned by an individual—although it was on a council estate, it had been bought—and people moved around the estate, sometimes on bicycles, to supply people who turned up at the estate in cars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That whole operation caused my constituents a great deal of annoyance. Eventually, convictions were obtained against some of the people involved. However, there would have been outrage if one or two of the people on the periphery of the operation had lost their tenancies, but the house which was probably at its centre, had not been affected. It is important that we try to have evenness. I would almost urge the Minister to look not so much at the idea of including this in a housing measure but to see it as a Home Office matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my experience, once there is a conviction, the problem disappears. Six or 12 months before conviction is when there is bitterness and anger. Local people can see what is going on and are appalled by it, but they cannot stop it. The police are saying that they need more evidence before they can bring a prosecution. That is when people want action; not after conviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a problem, but I urge the Minister not to discriminate against council tenants as against owner-occupiers when the latter may be causing a bigger mischief than council tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
