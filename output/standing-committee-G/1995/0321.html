</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will, of course, explain the amendments in immense detail, but I shall try to do briefly. Clause 148 defines priority need. It might help the Committee if I give a brief background to how the concept of priority need came into existence. It was first put forward in a circular that was issued in the early months of 1974 and which had bipartisan support. The circular was issued under the then Conservative Government, but was supported fully by the incoming Labour Government. The circular set out broad views on how local authorities should discharge their responsibilities towards the homeless. It advocated the need to take a broad view of responsibility, but it accepted that, in areas where there was a shortage of accommodation, first call must go to the most vulnerable, who were defined as those in the priority need categories.<br><br>
Those priority need categories were then picked up in the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977. The code of guidance issued in 1977 that accompanied that legislation amplified further how local authorities should discharge their responsibilities towards those in the priority need categories. Nineteen years has elapsed since then; the code has undergone a series of revisions and circumstances have changed. Some new needs have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 756</span>
emerged that were not anticipated in 1977, so it is appropriate to review the definitions and the guidance.<br><br>
The purpose of this group of amendments is to highlight weaknesses in current definitions, identify groups of people who might be considered to be in priority need and, above all, focus the Government's attention on the importance of reviewing the categories to which priority is accorded. We do not expect the amendments to be accepted immediately. Indeed, we would be surprised if they were. However, we hope that the Government will heed what we are saying and pay attention to the categories of need that we are identifying. We want to ensure that provisions for the relief of homelessness are developed in a way which accommodates the range of needs that should be given priority today.<br><br>
Let me describe the various categories. Amendment No. 423 covers people suffering from a visual impairment. It is based on evidence submitted by the Royal National Institute for the Blind, which has highlighted the extent to which people with visual impairments suffer discrimination in obtaining accommodation. They find it more difficult than others to secure accommodation so they should be given, in the RNIB's view, priority when they are homeless.<br><br>
The original code of guidance that was issued in 1977 specifically highlighted people who were blind as one of the categories that should be assisted. It referred to people suffering mental illness, handicap or physical disability and stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"This includes those who are blind, deaf, dumb or otherwise substantially disabled mentally or physically."</p></blockquote>
Unfortunately, that clear and precise wording has disappeared from subsequent versions of the code and the RNIB feels—reasonably, I believe—that greater emphasis should be placed on the needs of people with visual impairment.<br><br>
Amendment No. 448 is about young people aged 16 or 17. The vulnerability of young, single homeless people is not questioned. It is well known that they are, sadly, all too often at risk of exploitation. We hear too many chilling stories of the misfortunes that befall young people who, for whatever reason, find themselves homeless and on the streets. The number of young people sleeping rough increased dramatically during the 1980s; but that is only part of the total. Many more are sleeping on friends' floors, squatting, staying in temporary hostels or bed-and-breakfast accommodation or making other temporary arrangements. They are likely to become homeless—literally homeless—at any time. The majority of them have become homeless through no fault of their own. Many have been discharged from care; others have had to leave the parental home because of domestic conflict—sometimes abuse—or because they were told that when they reached the age of 16 they would have to fend for themselves. It seems right that we should pay more attention to the needs of young single people, who are particularly vulnerable.<br><br>
Amendment No. 451 seeks to include those who qualify for advice and assistance under section 24(2) of the Children Act 1989 or who are taken to be in need under section 17 of that Act. The amendment deals specifically with young people leaving care. Everyone accepts
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0431">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 757</span>
that young people leaving care should be helped to secure good quality accommodation, and not be left to drift between various unsatisfactory and temporary homes. The purpose of the amendment is patently obvious.<br><br>
Amendment No. 495 is about people who have a housing need assessed under section 46 of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990. Such people have a defined need under community care policies. Unfortunately, although one might expect it to be so, such people are not automatically assessed as being vulnerable and in priority need if they become homeless. Sadly, they have to undergo separate tests to establish whether they are vulnerable. Sometimes, if the supporting evidence is poor, applicants may be judged to be not vulnerable, even though a separate arm of the local authority or the social services authority, may have decided that the applicant requires care and support under the community care policy. It is obviously sensible to ensure, whenever possible, that those assessments are made in tandem and that people should not be assessed as in need under one piece of legislation and not under another. The purpose of the amendment is to establish that people who are defined as in need under the community care policy should be treated as vulnerable and in priority need if they are homeless.<br><br>
The next category is people who are fleeing violence or harassment. I am thinking predominantly about women who have suffered domestic violence, but other circumstances may be covered. In the original code of guidance, the Government of the day took a robust view. They said:
<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretaries of State consider that it would be appropriate under this heading for authorities to secure whenever possible that accommodation is available for battered women without children who are at risk of violent pursuit or, if they return home, at risk of further violence".</p></blockquote>
It is clear that, even in 1977, women, even women without children, who faced the risk of domestic violence should be treated as being in priority need. The problem, as the Minister knows, is that because the priority need categories define families with children as the principle group—of course, there are others—someone who has suffered and fled from domestic violence who does not have a child will not be in the priority need categories: That results in an obvious problem. Those people may be extremely vulnerable and may have suffered traumatic and disturbing experiences. The fact that they do not have a child prevents them in many areas from being considered for rehousing. We believe that their needs should be given greater priority and concern, which is the purpose of the amendment.<br><br>
Amendment No. 499 covers people who are HIV positive, a group that could not have been foreseen when the legislation was introduced in 1977. People who are HIV positive frequently suffer discrimination in the allocation of housing—if it is known that they are HIV positive, of course. They are also subject to fluctuations in health that cannot easily be anticipated. When the initial assessment is made, they might appear not to have any serious health problems, but their health may deteriorate rapidly. We have received some disturbing illustrations of how an authority may refuse accommo-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 758</span>
dation to homeless people who are HIV positive on the grounds that they appear to be in reasonable health, only for that health to deteriorate rapidly within a short time, leading to the need for a reassessment by the authority. In such cases, it would surely be better for those people to be afforded priority at an earlier stage.<br><br>
The final category—I felt that I owed it to the Committee to explain precisely the purposes behind the amendments—is dealt with by amendment No. 496, which concerns people to whom duties are owed under section 117 of the Mental Health Act 1983. Health and social service authorities are under duty to provide aftercare services for people who have been detained for hospital treatment and are subsequently discharged. In such cases, it is important that those people receive suitable housing. We believe that the amendment is in line with the broad thinking of the original legislation, which specifically referred to people who suffered from mental illness. The amendment would give additional clarity to the responsibilities, and would ensure that people discharged from hospital were not left in the lurch without adequate accommodation.<br><br>
As I mentioned, we do not expect all the amendments to be accepted—I should be surprised if they were—but they each deal with a category of need, and we expect the Government to take them seriously. I hope that the Minister will show at least a willingness to ensure that appropriate guidance is issued to highlight local authorities' responsibilities and to ensure that a wide and sympathetic approach is adopted to all those categories of people with special needs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Diana Maddock <span class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I endorse the closing remarks of the hon. Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford). I support all the amendments, but I want especially to speak to amendments Nos. 448 and 451, which I tabled.<br><br>
I am particularly concerned about the plight of 16 and 17-year-olds. Amendment No. 448 would enshrine in statute a concrete responsibility for local authorities to provide housing for homeless 16 and 17-year-olds, who would be an absolute priority need. That is fair and right. During our proceedings, I have tabled similar amendments, and I outlined during our previous sitting two cases of the sorts of problems that young homeless people faced when they were out in the world.<br><br>
Young homeless people are one of the most vulnerable groups. Since the mid-1980s, the number of 16 and 17-year-olds who are homeless has increased dramatically. Fortunately, there is now the rough sleepers initiative, but many people still slip through the net. As has been said, they sometimes squat, they sleep on a friend's floor, or they end up in hostels that are extremely unsuitable for vulnerable 16 and 17-year-olds. They face exploitation. Some of them turn to crime and prostitution because of their circumstances, others get into drug abuse and alcohol misuse. Sixteen and 17-year-olds are vulnerable and face all those risks. It is vital that local authorities have a specific duty to make that group a priority.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
Amendment No. 451 also deals with young people, but with those who are perhaps even more vulnerable—those who have been in care. Some people have thought that those young people who leave home at 18
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0432">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 759</span>
do so because they are irresponsible. That is not the case if they have come out of care; they have not got a home. Although the Children Act 1989 has helped, there are many examples—I referred to two in the previous sitting—of young people who slip through the net despite that Act. We could help by agreeing to the amendments, which would make it clear that housing authorities and social service departments had an absolute duty to co-operate and ensure that such people received every assistance as a matter of priority.<br><br>
The Children's Society has told me about the circumstances in which a young girl—Sally—found herself. I hope that this example will persuade the Minister of the need to take on board the two amendments to which I have spoken. Sally suffered sexual abuse throughout her childhood. Her siblings were also abused. Because of the abuse, her family came to the attention of the local social services department, which removed Sally and her brothers and sisters from the family home. Sally was placed in foster care, where she spent her early adolescence.<br><br>
When Sally left the care of the local authority, she moved out of her foster placement and found accommodation elsewhere. However, there was no support for her. If my children, or those of other hon. Members, left home, they would have support, but children such as Sally have no support. Sally was unable to maintain the accommodation. She became homeless. She approached the local housing authority, which refused to accept her as being vulnerable. Later, she approached a Children's Society project, which supported her application. The authority consequently changed its mind and she was accepted as being vulnerable.<br><br>
We owe it to young people to ensure that there is no doubt in the minds of local authorities where their duties lie when dealing with 16 and 17-year-olds and vulnerable young people who have left care.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration (Mr. David Curry)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Greenwich for the way in which he spoke to the amendments. He seeks to ensure that we pay attention to the representations that are being made and find out whether the categories that have been established since 1977 need to be updated. As the hon. Gentleman will know, there is a mechanism in the 1977 Act whereby the definitions can be updated. The mechanism has never been used, and we have received few representations to persuade us that it should be used. The categories that have been referred to are clearly dealt with in general terms under the current definitions.<br><br>
However, if a clear case is made that we should add to those definitions and that there should be a new category, I should be willing to consider such representations very carefully with a view to using the mechanism to add to the definitions.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock) mentioned those who leave care. Clearly, one would want to examine that category of people, especially given the example which the hon. Lady cited. I appreciate that voluntary organisations want to highlight the problems of their particular client groups while we
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 760</span>
debate the Bill. I would want a clear case to be made out before considering the definitions used. One would need to consider the role of various agencies with statutory responsibilities and how they link with one another. One would also need to examine the relationship between what should be set down in primary legislation, and the consequential guidance that would be necessary to amplify the way in which it was to be implemented.<br><br>
I can be helpful to the hon. Member for Greenwich, who asked me to have at heart the concerns that the amendments represented. He knows, I think, that it would not be easy for a Minister to pick and choose among them as they are expressed at present, but I hope that he will accept my assurance that I will listen carefully to representations. Where a clear case is made out that we should use a mechanism that will continue to exist for updating the categories, I shall be willing to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that assurance. I accept entirely that it is difficult to exercise the judgment of Solomon among a range of competing claims, so we will not press any of the amendments to a vote. We are, however, concerned that the guidance should reflect the range of needs that we have identified and that the Government should be sensitive, as the Minister said that he would be, to the representations that are made and will, no doubt, continue to be made for possible changes in priority need categories. With that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

DUTIES TO PERSONS BECOMING HOMELESS INTENTIONALLY</div> <!-- title -->

<br><blockquote><p>"or are not satisfied that he has priority need.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take new clause 47—<i>Duties to homeless persons not in priority need and not homeless intentionally</i>—
<ol>
<li>"This section has effect subject to section 155 (duty where other suitable accommodation available).</li>
<li>This section applies where the local housing authority are satisfied that an applicant is homeless, eligible for assistance and did not become homeless intentionally but are not satisfied that he has priority need.</li>
<li>The authority shall provide the applicant with advice and such assistance as they consider appropriate in the circumstances in any attempts he may make to secure that accommodation becomes avail able for his occupation.".</li></ol></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 590 and new clause 47 are alternative ways of achieving the same thing—making it clear that local authorities have duties to homeless people who are unintentionally homeless, but not in priority need.<br><br>
In our last sitting we discussed what we should do about homeless people, and we all agreed that preventing homelessness and giving the widest assistance was the purpose of the Bill. Under clause 149(2) and (3) there is a duty to people who become homeless intentionally, which covers people who are not in priority
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0433">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 761</span>
need. Clause 151 deals with unintentionally homeless households, but only those that fall into a priority need category. It does not cover duties to people who are not in priority need.<br><br>
In the Housing Act 1985 there was a duty to such people. That is a serious omission from the Bill and I hope that the Minister will consider the matter favourably. Under clause 149 there is a blanket duty to intentionally homeless people. If they were only threatened with homelessness. they would be covered by a blanket duty under clause 153.<br><br>
Section 65 of the Housing Act 1985 lays down a duty to unintentionally homeless people who are not in priority need. I hope that the Minister will take advantage of the opportunity to correct matters, which may entail lawyers reviewing the measure.<br><br>
If members of the Committee are alert this morning, they will notice a mistake in new clause 47. The title is correct, but the word "not" has been omitted from subsection (2). I hope that hon. Members will understand the intended meaning. I am not sure how Standing Orders apply—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It might help the hon. Lady to know that the word "not" has been restored.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. Before members of the Committee leapt down my throat, I wanted to clarify the meaning, and I assembled my notes last night. I hope that the Minister will realise the intention behind the new clause, which is not to reduce the existing duties under the Housing Act 1985. The principle behind the new clause is straightforward, and I hope that the Minister will accept it in some form or other.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I could not understand amendment No. 590. The hon. Member for Christchurch has asked me to look favourably on new clause 47. I am not prepared to look at it favourably; I will go one better—I will accept it. I know that until now the hon. Lady has been disappointed. The hon. Member for Greenwich is winning 2-0 on acceptances; this makes it 2-1 and I hope that the hon. Lady will be prepared to move her clause, which we will accept.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It might assist the hon. Lady if I tell her that she should move her new clause formally when we reach it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for that advice, Mr. McWilliam. I am grateful to the Minister. All sorts of interesting things have happened to me this morning. I wondered what else was going to happen, but I did not expect that it would be this. I am extremely pleased. The new clause is within the intention behind the Bill, and I hope that I will get the mechanism right and move the clause at the correct moment.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>"(3A) Assistance under section 149(3) may include a grant or loan, and where an authority is satisfied that an applicant will be required as a condition of securing accommodation to pay a lump sum by way of deposit, rent advance or other security they shall give assistance by way of grant or loan unless they are satisfied that the applicant will be able to pay such lump sum without assistance under this section.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(3B) Assistance given under section 149(3A) shall be on such terms and conditions as the authority may determine.".</p></blockquote>
I am normally an egalitarian by inclination, but in view of the Minister's offer to the hon. Member for Christchurch, this time I must ask for the appropriate differentials to be restored, and for the Minister to make it 3-1 rather than 2-1.<br><br>
The amendment would specifically allow local authorities to provide rent deposits as part of a general duty to provide advice and assistance to non-priority groups, so it addresses some of the issues raised by the hon. Member for Christchurch. The amendment addresses the difficulties experienced by homeless people in gaining access to private rented accommodation. We consider that providing assistance by means of rent deposits will be useful in that regard.<br><br>
On Tuesday morning, the Minister and I discussed families to which the local authority does not—or will not under the Bill—have an obligation to provide accommodation. We discussed the case of two families in identical circumstances. One lived in local authority accommodation and one did not. The Minister put the case of a family who lost their home in Belgravia, and asked me whether I thought that there should be an obligation to then. The implication of what the Minister said them was that the degree of assistance that an authority should provide should more be related to need than I implied. With the amendment, I am testing how far the Minister is prepared to go.<br><br>
The objective of the amendment is to try to provide the necessary practical assistance to people who are unintentionally homeless and in need, but who are not in a priority group. They may well need assistance to be able to access available private accommodation. Often it is a real problem for them to get the initial rent deposit together. They may, as we discussed on Tuesday, have lost their home in some form of tragedy—fire, flood or other emergency. It is often difficult for people in such a vulnerable situation to raise a deposit on rented accommodation. The problem may be sheer poverty. It may be that their relationship with the benefits system makes them unable to raise the necessary money, or they may be young people—a group that the hon. Member for Christchurch rightly mentioned. A 16 or 17-year-old through no fault of his own may face huge obstacles in his search for accommodation. His experience in the housing market may be compounded by his lack of financial resources and his difficulty in establishing an entitlement to benefit.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
Such young people are unlikely to be able to raise the

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 763</span>
sums required for deposit on properties for rent. The Department of Social Security's proposals to reduce housing benefit entitlement to the under-25s from October this year will increase their problems, as housing providers will be reluctant to accommodate that group. The south Birmingham young homeless project, which I have mentioned before does some very good work in my constituency. It has said that if you look at housing association or private sector landlords, Mr. Me William, very few of them are prepared to accommodate that age group. Because of difficulties in claiming benefit, many hostels now require a rent guarantee, which is not always forthcoming, before they will accommodate. We are again forced to wonder how many young people will be left out in the cold—many will be in the cycle of no home, no job. Young, vulnerable, homeless people will be totally disadvantaged in the labour market, so a new generation will grow up facing the same difficulties that they experienced in their family life, which has been disrupted, unsettled and unstable.<br><br>
To deal fully with the lack of appropriate accommodation is far beyond the scope of the amendment, or indeed, the Bill, but the amendment could contribute to alleviating the problem. I accept that it would be a modest contribution, but it would provide flexibility to offer some assistance with rent deposits as part of the general advice and assistance that we hope will be available to non-priority groups. The amendment is particularly pertinent to young people, but it would be useful to others who are classified as non-priority, but who are unintentionally homeless and certainly in need.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Putting aside my dislike of nouns being used as verbs, such as the "access", I think that I can assist the hon. Gentleman. Amendment No. 502 would give local authorities a power that is already available to them. In March last year my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State issued a general consent to local authorities under section 25 of the Local Government Act 1988, allowing them to incur expenditure on rent deposits and guarantees to help people to secure accommodation in the private rented sector. We know from the code of guidance research that almost 100 authorities are already doing that and we are happy that they are opening up access to the private sector in that way. We expect that consent to remain in place and we are willing to spell out the facility in the guidance. In addition, authorities can give a grant or loan under clause 149(3) of the Bill.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that, grammar apart, our aims are the same and that in the light of my reassurance, he will withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Brooke <span class='memberconstituency'>(City of London and Westminster, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On Tuesday, Belgravia began to play the same role in the Committee's affairs as Cleopatra did in earlier sittings. After the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson) had spoken, I intervened briefly when my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (Mr. Ashby) attributed a generic quality to Camden. Earlier in our proceedings on Tuesday, Belgravia was cited by my hon. Friend the Minister in the same generic manner. I did not intervene on that occasion because time's winged chariot was clattering at
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 764</span>
that stage. As I said on Tuesday, I am the only Committee member to have served on the London borough of Camden, and I think that I can claim—as the constituency Member—a better knowledge of Belgravia than any other Committee member. I want to put on record the fact that Belgravia is a place where dukes live next door to dustmen. I accept that a Belgravia dustman may be different from any other dustman in the kingdom, but I should be grateful if my hon. Friend the Minister did not pursue that generic reference to the Belgravia ward of my constituency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the Minister wants to reply to that, but I am grateful for what he said earlier. I ask him to remember that, in endorsing the provision and the existing guidelines, it is important to recognise that local authorities also need to have the means to put into practice those good intentions.<br><br>
On that basis, I am not only prepared to turn nouns into nouns rather than nouns into verbs but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

BECOMING HOMELESS INTENTIONALLY</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 565, in page 78, line 2, after "he", insert "either—
<br><blockquote><p>(a) fails to take up occupation of accommodation offered to him, which it would have been reasonable for him to occupy, or</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(b)"</p></blockquote>
The definition of intentional homelessness under subsection (1) does not mention an applicant whom the local authority has a statutory duty to assist and who, having been offered suitable accommodation, refuses it. The Green Paper, to which I referred on Tuesday, proposed that the definition of intentionality should be expanded to cover that. I would be the first to acknowledge that the concept is referred to in general terms in clause 151(6), but a direct reference in clause 150(1) would make the matter clearer, which is the basis of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hasten to abase myself before my right hon. Friend over the generic use of the word "Belgravia".<br><br>
I am sympathetic to the purpose of the amendment, but we can achieve it by another means if the Committee accepts amendment No. 454, which I intend to move when the time comes. Amendment No. 454 would give authorities a power to end the duty to secure accommodation if the applicant has turned down an offer of suitable accommodation. In such a scenario, the applicant would render himself homeless intentionally, in consequence of his own action.<br><br>
Moreover, the provisions of clause 150 already provide that a person who fails to take up suitable alternative accommodation which is available in the area, and which the local authority has helped him to obtain, will be treated as having become homeless intentionally, if he makes a further application under the homelessness legislation.<br><br>

I believe that the point of most concern to my right hon. Friend is what happens when an applicant refuses an offer of suitable accommodation. I think that that circumstance is adequately covered by amendment No. 454 and, if the Committee is persuaded to accept that amendment, that would deal with the problem about which my right hon. Friend is concerned. Given that, I hope that he feels that he need not pursue his amendment at this juncture.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for his remarks about Belgravia. I have not yet found Government amendment No. 454 on the amendment paper so I am taking his word totally on faith. The generosity with which he spoke about Belgravia means that my faith in him persists as ever, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 588, in page 78, line 7, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) For the purposes of subsection (1), where a mental disorder on the part of a person was or was likely to have been a material factor in an act or omission of that person, that act or omission shall not be treated as deliberate.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2B) In this section "mental disorder" has the same meaning as in the Mental Health Act 1983.".</p></blockquote>
The Committee has expressed considerable concern about the way in which people with mental health problems are treated. The amendment belongs to a series of amendments that have been tabled to ensure that we protect people with mental health problems.<br><br>
As a result of their problems, some of those people cause difficulties for their landlords, such as anti-social conduct or damage to property. They do not always pay the rent and may be evicted, either by councils or by private landlords. As housing revenue accounts have been ring-fenced, housing authorities seem to show less concern for tenants' circumstances when trying to collect arrears. I suspect that matters will get worse once rent officers start looking at rent levels and so on.<br><br>
The Government took active steps to continue helping such people, but a problem clearly still exists. Many voluntary agencies believe that some areas are much stricter in their interpretation when deciding whether people with mental illness are intentionally homeless. If you are suffering from mental illness, you may do things for which you cannot really be held responsible. Setting fire to your property is one example.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. On the other hand, I might not be chairing this Committee if I had done so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. McWilliam. Tenants may set fire to their properties. They may suffer mental illness, but may not be taking their medication; however, there could be other reasons. The Government's guidance refers only to the most severe cases of applicants who are quite unable to manage their own affairs. If the Government do not legislate, I hope that they will go further in their guidance notes. Judicial reviews have already gone beyond existing legislation.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will look favourably on the amendment. It is intended to ensure that tenants evict-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 766</span>
ed for conduct as a result of their mental health are not treated as intentionally homeless.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the concern expressed by the hon. Lady. I hope that at least part of her concern is already met. The code of guidance is clear that a person should not be regarded as having made himself homeless intentionally if he is incapable of managing his own affairs. That reflects existing case law.<br><br>
Amendment 588 would go a long way further, in effectively disapplying the provisions on intentionality to a whole class of people, regardless of their actions. I cannot accept that. It is false to suggest that anyone suffering from a mental illness cannot make a rational decision. The amendment would mean that a person could habitually damage his accommodation, fail to pay rent, or cause a nuisance to neighbours and still require a local authority to secure accommodation for him. I do not think that local authorities would welcome that.<br><br>
I agree that there can, in certain circumstances, be a need to give special consideration to the particular sorts of case that we are talking about but that needs to be seen as part of a wider package of care and support, involving a range of agencies, including the housing authority. I shall therefore reflect on whether that issue needs to be dealt with further in the revised code of practice. On that basis, I ask the hon. Gentleman—I am sorry, I mean the hon. Lady—to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have received letters addressed to Mrs. Diana Maddock MP, Esq, so I am used to being called a man. Dare I say, Mr. McWilliam, that this seems a very sexist place.<br><br>
I accept what the Minister said. The purpose of the amendment was that the Minister should reflect on the subject. I wanted to ensure that a category of people who could find themselves in difficulty would not be turned away. Given the Minister's assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am relieved to see you in the Chair this morning, Mr. McWilliam. On Tuesday afternoon, when Mrs. Winterton was in the Chair, we seemed to get into difficulties; she referred to the Minister as being cuddly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Cute.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 767</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My co-Chairman is entitled to her opinions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I feared Mrs. Winterton's comments about myself and I am glad that she is not in the Chair today. However, I am a little disappointed because I shall be referring to her constituency. One of the amendments would remove the provision under which a person should not be treated as becoming homeless if there were a reasonable excuse for him not to become homeless. The second amendment deals with whether a person accepts the advice of the local authority.<br><br>
I wish to refer to a case that involved my constituents who emigrated to Australia some years ago. The proceeds from the sale of their house paid for their fare. After two years, that decision turned out to be disastrous and the family returned to this country penniless and homeless. They went to live with the wife's mother and stepfather in an attractive house in Congleton in which there was plenty of room, but complete incompatibility between the stepfather and the small children. He believed that children should rarely be seen and certainly never heard. After a few months, the position became intolerable and the family moved out of the home.<br><br>
They first went to live with the husband's parents in Macclesfield and then moved to Stockport to live with the wife's sister in what were again overcrowded circumstances. After a fair amount of frustration caused by there being too many people in the household, the family were told that they would be put out on the streets the following Friday. Unfortunately, the husband was short-tempered and had an up-and-downer with local housing officials. He questioned their parentage and so on, and the housing department was keen to find reasons not to help the family.<br><br>
Under the clause, housing officials could come up with perfectly good excuses why they should not give assistance to such a family. It could be argued that it would be reasonable for the family to return to the house in Congleton, which had enough room for them although they would suffer unreasonable aggravation. Alternatively, the Stockport housing officials could have said that, since the family had lived in Congleton and also in Macclesfield with the husband's parents, they could seek advice from either of those local authorities. I consider that the family were misguided in thinking that they could do better in Australia than they could in Stockport. Having returned to this country, however, it was reasonable to expect the local authority to find them accommodation.<br><br>
Surely the Bill can be simplified by removing clause 150(3) that refers to whether it is possible for people to make reasonable arrangements and by removing subsection (4) which deals with guidance. Local authorities can exercise their duties by simply telling people that they have a good claim with another authority. As a result, people end up being batted backwards and forwards between authorities. I accept that some authorities tend to have contact with more homeless people than they consider to be their fair share. However, such provisions are not helpful.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 515 and 516 deal with the slightly less acute situation in which someone is threatened with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 768</span>
homelessness as opposed to being homeless. The Minister should find a way of giving guidance to local authorities to enable them to deal fairly with such people instead of leaving it up to them whether to brush people aside.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not be tempted by the hon. Gentleman into thinking what adjectives would go with "Bennett".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: "Brilliant".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would certainly be a runner.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked me a question about the couple that he mentioned. My immediate reaction is that that family would probably not fall within the new provisions on collusion that we envisage in clause 150. He also said that the relationship between primary legislation and guidance is important because a local authority must be able to interpret and have a sense of the particular circumstances. The Government do not pretend that there is a massive or intractable problem. As the hon. Gentleman said, local authorities can probably sort out problems almost intuitively. However, there may be circumstances when local authorities deserve to have the power to sort out problems. We do not intend to impose a new draconian power but local authorities may need a little extra support to sort out problems, so we hope that they will see the clause as providing that. Clearly, they must draw on their experience, but if we can give illustrations or show a sensible approach in the guidance, I am willing to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise to speak specifically to amendment No. 515, which would ensure that women and children who are escaping domestic violence will not be viewed as having contrived to effect eviction. I have spoken to women who have suffered domestic violence and there is agreement in the Committee that we must do our best to help people in that position. I need not labour the point, but I hope that the Minister will accept the spirit of the amendment—I realise that I cannot possibly expect to have two amendments accepted in one sitting. It is an important issue. I agree that there is a good system of hostel accommodation that is much better now than it was years ago. I visited an extremely good one in Tunbridge Wells that was put together by the local authority and the Moat Housing Association. However, I should hate to think that the women being helped there would not be given priority when they have to move on. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will accept the spirit of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support that I shall withdraw my amendment because that is in the spirit of making progress, but I am a little worried about the idea that we shall have an Act of Parliament that says one thing and guidance that will say something a little more sympathetic. If cases have to be tested in court, the judge will consider the Act of Parliament first and then the guidance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend should not be in the least surprised because this is the product of a situation that we fully understand—the Secretary of State deter-

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 769</span>
mining the legislation and the unfortunate Minister who does not agree with a word of it trying to mitigate it or put a more humane gloss on it in the guidance. That is the inevitable product of the Government's curious position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree. The Minister in charge of the Bill at this stage must accept that it is what the Secretary of State has put into the legislation that will operate rather than his more humane approach, which we hope will be reflected in the guidance notes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should also know that what Ministers say during the passage of a Bill is taken into consideration in legal proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to make progress, but the Minister invites me to consider a red herring. I am no lawyer, but there is a complicated case and a legal judgment. I am aware that the law has shifted slightly from the absolute requirement for the judge to take account of what was in the Bill, to the more progressive and liberal view that the judge may take into account what the Minister said.<br><br>
I assume that the example that I gave is all right. The local authority will follow the guidance, rather than what is written into the Bill. If the matter gets to court, the judge will say, "That is what is in the Bill, but the Minister was much more sympathetic in Committee, and I will take his line." We shall see.<br><br>
The Minister is in a bit of difficulty. I will withdraw the amendment, but I hope that before Report stage he will reflect on whether it makes for good legislation if there is a conflict between what is written into the Bill and what he intends to put into the guidance. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

DUTY TO PERSONS WITH PRIORITY NEED WHO ARE NOT HOMELESS INTENTIONALLY</div> <!-- title -->

<br><blockquote><p>"are not satisfied that he became".</p></blockquote>
This is another amendment designed to ensure that provisions of the Housing Act 1985 remain in the Bill. In the 1985 Act there is a full duty in cases where local authorities are satisfied of homelessness and priority need, but not satisfied of intentionality, and there is a second, lesser duty in all other cases where the authority is satisfied of a person's homelessness. The Act requires the authority
<br><blockquote><p>"to provide advice and such assistance as may be appropriate in the circumstances, in any attempts he may make to secure that accommodation becomes available for his occupation."</p></blockquote>
The replacement provisions in the Bill do not seem to be intended to alter that position. I am advised by lawyers, however, that because of their drafting, the new provisions may do so. Clause 151, line 22, deals with the full duty. As drafted, the local authority must be satisfied that the person was not intentionally homeless,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 770</span>
rather than not being satisfied that he was intentionally homeless.<br><br>
There appears to be a gap between the drafting of clauses 151 and 149. I hope that the Minister will look favourably on the matter. The amendment means that if a local authority is less than satisfied that someone is intentionally homeless, he should be regarded as unintentionally homeless, which restates the current position.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the group contains a majority of Government amendments, which the Minister will presumably accept, perhaps I should move the amendment formally, sit down and allow the Minister to accept the lot; we should then achieve one or two valuable improvements to the Bill. However, I fear that the Minister will not be so generous towards amendment No. 506 as he has been towards the amendments moved by the hon. Member for Christchurch. Therefore, it is only right that I should state the reasons for moving amendment No. 506. Other amendments in the group would have an effect similar to amendment No. 506, and some are partly consequential, but amendment No. 506 is crucial. I shall state why it is vital.<br><br>
During the debates on homelessness, a clear division has been established between the views held by Labour members of the Committee and those held to some degree by members of the Government. Our view is that the best and most appropriate response to the needs of homeless people is to get them back into permanent accommodation as quickly as possible. They should not be required to spend time in temporary accommodation; we should not revert to a framework in which temporary accommodation is either the norm or is provided in many cases. In saying that, we are repeating the view of all those who have been concerned with the relief of homelessness during the past 20 years.<br><br>
When moving the Second Reading of the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977, the late Stephen Ross emphasised the importance of what it would do. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"In 1948, it was believed that a short stay in some kind of temporary accommodation would be adequate to tide people over until they could make arrangements for somewhere permanent to live. That may have been so then, but the nature of homelessness today is certainly not like that. Fires and floods still happen, certainly, but we are not now dealing with a situation in which people can sort out their own housing problems after a short stay in what is known as temporary accommodation. The need of most homeless people is a permanent solution to their problem which they have been unable to arrange themselves."—[<i>Official report,</i> 18 February 1977; Vol. 926, c. 898.]</p></blockquote>
That emphasis on permanent accommodation was endorsed in the code of guidance issued to accompany the 1977 Act. The code has been much updated since, but the original version of paragraph 4.4 of the code stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"Permanent accommodation should be secured as soon as possible. Homeless people should not be obliged to spend a certain period in interim accommodation as a matter of policy."</p></blockquote>
Despite all the various revisions since 1977, that has remained the thrust of Government policy until now.<br><br>
The revised code of practice—issued as recently as 1994—made exactly the same point. Paragraph 2.8 of the 1994 code states:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 772</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"If an authority is satisfied that an applicant is homeless, in priority need, and has not become homeless intentionally, the authority then has a duty to secure that accommodation is made available. The legislation makes it clear that the authority's duty to such an applicant is to secure long-term settled accommodation, commonly described as 'permanent'".</p></blockquote>
Everyone involved in the relief of homelessness knows that to be right. The National Housing Forum, which represents an enormous range of interests—local authority associations, voluntary organisations, professional institutes and many other groups—made clear in its submission, which I believe that all members of the Committee have seen, that permanent accommodation is what homeless people require. Point 3 of the submission states clearly and emphatically:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Forum believes that permanent, secure accommodation is the most appropriate form of housing for those currently defined as priority homeless."</p></blockquote>
The only people who do not seem to believe that to be right are the Government. That is why we are going through this miserable process—an attempt to undermine the statutory provision that has existed for 20 years, which has provided an effective and successful framework for the relief of homelessness, and which everyone except the Government believes should remain in place. We are moving amendment No. 506 to try to maintain a sensible framework, rather than to allow the position that has existed and worked successfully for 20 years to be eroded.<br><br>
Originally, the Government took the view that the obligation should essentially be to provide temporary accommodation for a period of 12 months, and that people should then be assessed according to waiting lists to see whether they qualified for permanent accommodation through a different route. We now know that the Minister accepts that that view was unreasonable, that he is prepared to mitigate the situation by extending the period to up to 24 months, and that some people may directly be rehoused. There is a lack of clarity about who will be directly rehoused, but we understand that at least some people will be.<br><br>
Of course, all sorts of problems remain. What will happen at the end of 24 months if no permanent accommodation has been provided? What will happen during those 24 months to families who are required to spend that time in temporary accommodation, unable to put down roots or to get their children settled into a new home or a permanent school, because hanging over them throughout that period is uncertainty about whether they will ever be able to regard their home as permanent, or whether they will be moved to alternative accommodation—which might be nearby, but might be some distance away?<br><br>
Having stressed the damaging impact that that is likely to have on families and on their children's education, it is worth remembering that two thirds of households who are accepted as homeless by local authorities in England are families who have or are expecting children. Under the Bill the large majority of homeless applicants in that category will not be able to establish themselves with a proper degree of certainty and confidence. Instead, they will be condemned to a period of up to 24 months—or possibly longer—of insecurity and uncertainty.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0439">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 773</span>
We know that insecurity is one of the hallmarks of the Government's policy. They have revelled in bringing insecurity to people in the workplace. They have not revelled in it, but they have brought insecurity to millions of people in their homes who have faced the horror of repossession and are not confident of remaining in their homes in the years ahead. Now they are adding the insecurity of this mean-spirited Bill, which if not amended will leave homeless people unable to settle down, establish roots and begin once again to rebuild their lives. Instead of being helped to get back on their feet, those people will be deliberately kept in an insecure position.<br><br>
The only consolation is that the Government, who have deliberately created that insecurity, will come to know how damaging that process is. As we get closer to the general election, they will experience a richly deserved insecurity.<br><br>
Amendment No. 506 seeks to restore a proper framework for the relief of homelessness. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Unless the authority refer the application to another housing authority … they shall secure that accommodation is available for occupation by the applicant, and they shall take reasonable steps thereafter to secure that accommodation does not cease to be available for his occupation."</p></blockquote>
The amendment has many merits. First, it would clarify any ambiguity that might be left as a result of the Awua judgment, which has been referred to by the Minister, the hon. Member for Christchurch and Labour Members during previous debates. If there is uncertainty about local authorities' obligations to secure accommodation, that would be removed by the amendment.<br><br>
Secondly, the amendment would cope with the circumstances, which I have no doubt the Minister will raise in his response, whereby people require only temporary accommodation. The amendment would not require local authorities to secure permanent accommodation in all cases—another amendment would require that. We deliberately did not seek that requirement, as we accepted that there are circumstances in which people are looking for accommodation for a temporary period only, before they can resume occupation of their own permanent accommodation. One thinks particularly of the home owner whose house has burned down and who is waiting for an insurance claim to be processed so that he or she can purchase another home—in such a case, the need is only temporary, and we accept that entirely.<br><br>
Where we part company with the Government is that we believe that it is utterly wrong to impose an obligation on local authorities to house people only temporarily when their need is clearly for permanent accommodation. We believe that there should be a framework which ensures that ongoing accommodation is provided when it is needed.<br><br>
That is the purpose of the wording of amendment No. 506. It meets both of the circumstances that I have mentioned. It is consistent with the policy approach that has been followed for the past 19 years, and it does not impose a rigid requirements to provide permanent accommodation in all cases. It is demonstrably better than the Government's incoherent approach, which was initially based on the rigid view that accommodation must be temporary in all cases. The Minister is now
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 774</span>
moderating that view so that permanent rehousing is allowed in some cases. However, as we have made all too clear during previous sittings, that approach is riddled with anomalies. It is inconsistent, and will mean that some people in need are unreasonably left in temporary accommodation for longer than they should be.<br><br>
Shelter, on whose proposals the amendment is based, discussed the amendment with the Department last year, in the aftermath of the Awua judgment. The representatives of Shelter made it clear that they saw it as a sensible way to remove the ambiguity created by the judgment and that it would at the same time provide a sensible framework for the relief of homelessness. As Shelter has told us, the Government have made no satisfactory objection to the amendment and they have given no sensible reason for not accepting it.<br><br>
I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say. I suspect that he will have some difficulty finding a reason for rejecting it, but I have no doubt that he will reject it, as he is not master in this House—his Secretary of State is still, unfortunately, calling the shots. Until the Minister recognises that he is responsible for looking after the interests of homeless people and that he should not continue to peddle a piece of legislation that is fundamentally wrong and misconceived and which fails to recognise homeless people's needs, he will continue to justify the indefensible and to produce compromises that only cover up some of the worst aspects of the Bill and do not go to the heart of the problem.<br><br>
I fear that we shall not receive the response that we know is right and that I believe that the Minister knows in his heart of hearts to be right. I suspect that we shall not receive the same response that the hon. Member for Christchurch enjoyed for her amendment. I hope that I am wrong. I like to think that the Minister—who has receive widespread plaudits recently as a reasonable man, and who is clearly nervous that his responses may damage his career prospects in the Conservative party—will give us reason to say that those plaudits are justified. I hope that he will tell the Secretary of State to take the poisoned chalice and drink it—or, perhaps, to take the poisoned burger and eat it—and to do the right thing for homeless people by accepting amendment No. 506.</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an extremely complex group of amendments; unusually, it concludes a clause stand part. Amendment No. 506 has already been moved. I shall now call the hon. Member for Christchurch to speak to amendment No. 368. I shall them call the Minister to speak to the Government amendments. That seems tidier.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak to amendment No. 368. As the hon. Member for Greenwich said, it goes a little further than he would like, but I owe it to the memory of Stephen Ross to do so. I am equally concerned about the homeless.<br><br>
We have all been inundated with letters from groups and individuals at the sharp end, who believe that the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977 has worked well and that, although it may have needed amendment, the wholesale undoing of it is necessary. We have cited
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0440">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 775</span>
several times the views of Stephen Ross when he proposed the legislation in 1976. Even in 1948, it was recognised that temporary accommodation was not satisfactory. The Government have stated categorically—I am sure that the Minister will do so again—that homelessness does not always need a long-term solution. That may be so, but that is not the problem. Some people will drop out during the processes that are in place even now. Evidence shows that short lets and temporary accommodation form a merry-go-round. Many of those who are made homeless have other family problems, and the homeless also find it difficult to gain employment.<br><br>
It would appear that all parties are committed to making communities and families more stable. To achieve that, we must ensure that we deal particularly with the homeless. I and many others believe that the Bill will result in vulnerable people having to move from one home to another, which will not help the development of stable communities. That is particularly disruptive for children of homeless families when at school, for other children at the school and for the school itself. Before being elected to the House, I was chairman of the board of governors of a first school with a women's refuge in its catchment area. I know at first hand the extra problems caused to the school of children from that refuge attending school for only a short time. Fortunately, it was a small school and was able to give reasonable help to those children and their families. We are now being asked to enact a Bill that will lead to more families being put in such a situation. That is appalling. I oppose it and have continually opposed it. Today, we reach the crux of the matter.<br><br>
We have heard much from the Minister about the time scale. I point out, not for the first time, that two years is a very long time for a one or two year old. Endless studies have shown that early-year experiences make a great difference to what happens later in someone's life. Far too often, we take the short-term view in administering matters and our system of government allows that to happen. I believe that we should be taking a long-term view of the needs of some of the most vulnerable people in our society.<br><br>
The problem also exists for single vulnerable people. I firmly believe that there is no reason why we should undo something that has served us well over time, although I am happy to amend matters and make them better. Many of us have referred to the Awua case, which involved a matter that clearly needs to be dealt with. Other problems exist not because of how the 1977 Act has operated but because there are not enough properties available. I have had another letter this week from the organisation, Action with Communities in Rural England saying that the real problem is the lack of affordable housing rather than how the 1977 Act has operated. ACRE says that it is strongly against the Government's proposals and that I should strongly oppose them in Committee. I have received letters from individuals, too, including one from a lady in Somerset, begging me to raise these matters with the Secretary of State. I shall do so because they are important issues. The letter states:
<br><blockquote><p>"I am particularly concerned over the proposals that. Homeless families will no longer be on the priority list."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 776</span>
The lady believes that such families should have priority and that local authorities and housing associations know best about local needs and should be given the power to deal with them.<br><br>
There may be others who wish to speak in the debate. We have aired the issues time and again because we want to ensure that families and communities are stable. I have yet to hear Ministers respond to the issue of families. Perhaps the Minister will give us his views this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, as always, for the concern expressed by the hon. Member for Greenwich about my career. Clearly, there is an insidious campaign going on to undermine me. To be praised by him as being reasonable is difficult enough but to have it said in <i>The Guardian</i> is an almost insupportable burden, but I shall do my best to sustain myself.<br><br>
As the hon. Members for Greenwich and for Christ-church said, we are at the heart of the argument and the ruling on the Awua judgment, which came from the House of Lords, has made it an inescapable one. There could be an argument for saying "Just do nothing", but that would not be satisfactory. Therefore, as the hon. Gentleman said, there is a clear choice.<br><br>
The amendments in my name, which I shall move, are related to the length of the duty. They are predicated in the belief that homeless legislation should be a last resort rather than otherwise. The amendments will extend the duty to two years rather than one year, which would have been renewable, because there was concern that one year, even were it renewable, did not provide sufficient security. I was anxious that there should be a period that permitted a large proportion of homeless people to secure permanent accommodation. The average wait throughout the country is about 12 months for those who are rehoused off the housing register. To be precise, homeless people are rehoused in an average of eight months. There is a considerable period in temporary accommodation because averages are taken from such diverse areas and, clearly, England disguises some peaks and troughs. The average wait on the normal waiting list is about one-and-a-quarter years which, given the two lists, puts the average wait at about one year.<br><br>
I want to make better use of all the local housing that is available to ease some of the pressures on the housing register. The central argument concerns the pre-Awua judgment entitlement to life-long accommodation that is directly secured, which is what the hon. Member for Greenwich wants to reinstate. However, he has accepted that it be reinstated with some inflection, so that there would be circumstances in which a requirement for no more than temporary accommodation would be recognised. The amendment of the hon. Member for Christchurch would reinstate that position lock, stock and barrel.<br><br>
The Government want to provide a safety net of immediate help, which the Awua judgment removed in statutory terms. We should assess the basic need through the housing register route, because it is reasonable to make a distinction between homelessness that is provoked by a deep underlying need that will lead to permanent dependence, and homelessness as a mani-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0441">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 777</span>
festation of a crisis, which may not be permanent and, thus, be a situation that could be repaired. The evidence for that is shown by the 18 per cent, of homeless people who are accepted as homeless under the legislation and who leave the lists within about a year.<br><br>
It is almost universal that people now spend a period in temporary accommodation. Under our proposals, the majority of people will secure permanent accommodation well within two years. It is also true that there should be a single route into housing, a concept that the hon. Member for Greenwich has specifically repudiated. That is the central issue between us.<br><br>
I am anxious that the proposals work as effectively as possible. We recognise the need to ensure that local authorities have the means necessary to secure the provision of suitable accommodation from private sector landlords for the discharge of the new homelessness duty. During the past few years, some authorities have found that an effective way in which to harness the private rented sector is short term leasing. The current capital finance regulations limit the period for which such leases can be taken out to a maximum of three years without credit cover.<br><br>
Local authority associations have made representations to the effect that extending the period could lead to more efficient leasing, substantially reduce the use of bread and breakfast accommodation for homeless families and reduce the unit costs to local authorities in providing short term accommodation for homeless households. I understand that suggestion. Clearly, a relaxation of the rules on leasing needs to be seen in the context of not only the capital finance system, but in the coverage of the housing revenue account and the operation of housing benefit subsidy arrangements for subsidising rent rebates granted to tenants housed in short term accommodation.<br><br>
I propose to consult local authority associations on the possibility of a package of measures that would extend the period for which an authority may lease private rented accommodation for the homeless without credit cover for up to a maximum of perhaps 10 years. I emphasise the Government's readiness in principle to move to a maximum 10 year period for leasing. Such properties should be accounted for in the general fund rather than in the housing revenue account, so that they are treated the same as other expenditure in support of the homelessness duty. I hope that any changes that may result from the discussions will be effective by 1 April next year.<br><br>
I thought it important to make that brief statement because I am anxious to make the proposals work as effectively as possible. I want to give local authorities the maximum flexibility and the instruments to deal with that. In carrying out my local authority responsibilities I have been an enthusiast for freeing some of the capital financing constraints on local authorities so that they can act more effectively. We have done that in various contexts. The provisions will be helpful.<br><br>
I do not disguise the fact that there is a clear division across the Committee about the mechanism used to tackle homelessness. As the hon. Member for Greenwich predicted, I cannot accept his amendment. I promote my amendments. No doubt there will be a debate,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 778</span>
and I look forward to answering any points raised.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stephen Timms <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a simple point about the change that the Bill intends and which would be dealt with by the amendment moved by my hon. Friend for Greenwich. The Bill reintroduces a spectre that we all thought had disappeared many years ago—the phenomenon of families who never know what it is to have a secure home.<br><br>
I am certain that if my hon. Friend's amendment is defeated, there will be children who grow up never knowing what it is to be sure that they can stay in one place for more than two years. I do not know how many such children there will be—no one knows at this stage—but I fear that it could turn out to be a large number; there certainly will be some.<br><br>
As Ministers have pointed out on several occasions, some people want only temporary accommodation. That is fine, if it suits them, but preventing access to secure housing—making it impossible for some people to obtain secure housing—will have dreadful social effects.<br><br>
I welcome the change that the Minister has made from 12 months to 24 months. That will make a significant difference but, unlike the eight-month average period that he quoted, most homeless families in Newham are in temporary accommodation for at least two years. I am fairly sure that that is the case widely in London perhaps elsewhere.<br><br>
I also welcome the Minister's remarks about 10-year leases, which will be extremely helpful. I vividly remember when homelessness in Newham was mushrooming in 1985. Within a short time the number of homeless families increased from 30 to 600, and we came up with the option of leasing as a way of getting people out of the worst bed-and-breakfast accommodation, on which we were entirely dependent. We managed to lease some decent homes for people to stay in temporarily, but soon afterwards the Government insisted that leases had to be given up after two years.<br><br>
That created a huge bureaucracy. A massive apparatus was needed to keep a pool of short-term leases rolling over and over. The possibility of leasing homes for 10 years is a significant improvement and ends one of the more pernicious measures that the Government introduced previously.<br><br>
The fundamental problem of people who will never have a secure home remains. The Government have presented the measure as a rebalancing act which will slightly help people on the waiting list to move home a little faster, but the price will be that homeless families will be kept waiting a little longer. If that was the effect of the measure, there would be far less objection to it, but that is not what it does. It radically changes the position of people who are homeless. It does not slightly delay their obtaining a permanent home; it makes it possible that they will never obtain a permanent home. That is what is so objectionable about the measure and it is what is dealt with by the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich.<br><br>
It will be a terrible memorial to the Government's economic failure to meet the basic needs of our entire community if the amendment is not accepted. We are one nation. We are one community despite the recent
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0442">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 779</span>
trend in the Government's legislation. This measure will create terrible divisions and make the lives of a significant number of people very much worse that they would be if the amendment were accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hampstead and Highgate)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise essentially in response to what the Minister said. The Government's proposal formalises and establishes insecurity for families. My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Timms) welcomed the Government's change from one to two years for local authority accommodation and the possibility of 10 year leases in the private sector. That seems simply to set in train the possibility of a homeless family being in temporary housing for 12 years. They will have to move out of local authority accommodation after two years. Then they may be fortunate and move into the private sector. As we know short-term leases are the only kind of lease that landlords in the private sector offer. I have already produced evidence from the Joseph Roundtree Foundation showing that the majority of private landlords do not like taking families with children. They do not like tenants who are dependent upon housing benefit for their rent. Therefore we are already looking at a much reduced and restricted area of private housing. Certainly in London and my constituency that is already extremely low.<br><br>
That family, having been the responsibility of the local authority, may move into the private sector. The landlord may decide to throw them out after three months or six months. It may—there is no guarantee now—be the responsibility of the local authority to accept them as homeless. The hon. Member for Christ-church pointed out how long a year can be for a one-year-old and how long two years can be for a two-year-old. The Government are setting into statute the possibility that 13-year-olds will have known nothing but insecure accommodation for their entire lives.<br><br>
The serious effect that that is already having on children and families cannot be exaggerated. It is proven beyond any bounds of reasonable disbelief that children who do not have secure accommodation do less well at school, have greater difficulty establishing social relationships and are prey to childhood diseases which, in many instances, have not been seen on the streets of London for a considerable period of time. Marriages break down on that single issue alone. I have a number of cases in my constituency of families that have become fatherless because the father could no longer tolerate their homelessness. The mother is left with small children and no possibility of a secure home.<br><br>
I understand the reasoning behind the Minister's response, but he is avoiding the central essential issue. As has been pointed out to him on more than one occasion in Committee the supply of affordable rented accommodation is inadequate to meet the housing needs of the people in this country. We are talking about a formalisation of homelessness here. This has nothing to do with finding families homes and everything to do with formalising homelessness to make it even more acceptable than in many instances it is already. I find that totally unacceptable.<br><br>
We are setting in train for ourselves as a society the possibility of very serious social disorder and unrest. We
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 780</span>
are going to formalise a situation in which children will have always felt themselves to be outside the mainstream of society and communities. They will have no community loyalties. They will be changing schools regularly and will have no loyalty to education. They will certainly have no loyalty to individuals other than their family members. If we formalise a situation in which children are subliminally told that they are outside the social mainstream because they do not have a secure, fixed abode, we cannot wonder if, when they reach adolescence, they believe that they have a justifiable reason for punishing the society that has ignored them. I do not endorse that perspective, but I understand it.<br><br>
I do not believe that the Minister's words or the Government amendments will help to provide secure housing for families. All local authorities continually attempt to deal with major human crises in housing. They have decreasing stock in which they can house vulnerable homeless people. That is inadequate and totally disgraceful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In our debates, we have, sometimes inadvertently, referred to temporary homes. There are temporary houses, flats, maisonettes or other forms of accommodation, but no temporary homes. A home is more than a building. It means roots, a sense of belonging, contacts in the community, relationships with neighbours and friends, and networks, which include schools. Stability and continuity are important, especially for young children. My hon. Friends emphasised that.<br><br>
The Bill is not about the time scale for rehousing people; it denies families the right to a home, and young children the right to basic stability. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate said, one year is a long time for a five-year-old. In that time, the Bill could cause permanent damage. We are considering not only housing, but the devastation of the lives of some unfortunate people in our community. Those people already suffer because they are homeless. We should not underestimate the trauma of losing a home and having to go to the housing department. I do not know how often the Minister and Conservative Members have visited housing departments and seen people who have had to go there, with their children in train, and wait for hours while their circumstances are investigated. They already feel inadequate; they have to beg for their problem to be resolved. It is devastating for people who have gone through that and been placed in interim accommodation to face the prospect of no settled home for the forseeable future. If the Government have a conscience, they should be ashamed.<br><br>
There is a fundamental difference between current circumstances and the Government's proposal. The Minister has often said that people currently face periods in temporary accommodation. As I explained with reference to Sheffield, such a period sometimes lasts four to five weeks—that is typical for a fairly large city—while assessments of circumstances are made. That is different from the Government's proposal, which would mean that people would automatically be housed in temporary accommodation, and not simply while the local authority carried out an assessment.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0443">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 781</span>
The Minister claimed that most families would be housed in permanent accommodation within two years. That is a generalisation which is not true in many cases. As my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East said, it is not true in many parts of London. The situation will vary widely in many parts of the country. When the Minister asked his staff to ring round to find out how long people had to wait in different authorities, the answer from Sheffield was that, on average, people on the housing list had to wait two years for a letting. As Peter Morton, the assistant director of housing in Sheffield, told me the other day, that is a meaningless figure. In my constituency, it is virtually impossible to get a family home within two years; the time that most families have to wait is nearer 10 years. That is the reality. Is the Minister seriously asking people to wait on the list for so long before they have a settled home of their own?<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
The clause must be read with clause 161. The Minister talks about a review after two years. He must explain why, after two years in temporary accommodation in ordinary local authority housing, the family cannot stay there. Why do families have to move on to a hostel or leased accommodation? Why do they have to live in several lots of temporary accommodation, constantly moving from one house, flat or maisonette to another? That is not acceptable.<br><br>
Despite the Minister saying that in some circumstances, homeless families can be found permanent accommodation, he has not explained which clause gives local authorities the power to do that. What really worries me is that value judgments are being made that homeless families are themselves in the wrong and it is their own fault that they are homeless. They should not therefore be entitled to permanent accommodation because they deserve punishment, or a period of probation in temporary accommodation to sort themselves out and to make sure they do not misbehave in future. My feeling on reading the Bill is that the Government are denying people permanent accommodation as a punishment for being homeless. I cannot accept that and I do not believe that the Minister, in his heart of hearts, can accept it either. I hope that if he does not accept the amendment, he will introduce a proposal to ensure that the situation that my hon. Friends and I describe does not come to pass. It will be a sad day for this country if it does.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Greenwich occasionally allows his rhetoric to take greater flight than is aeronautically sustainable. My hon. Friend the Minister issued the Government's substantial rebuttal of the amendments. I intervene only briefly on the basis of the hon. Gentleman's reference to our introducing job insecurity as an analogy to buttress the rest of his argument. That is a conventional Opposition nostrum and it ignores the world-wide trends in employment patterns. The Government have successfully sustained employment through greater flexibility; if the Opposition think that unemployment is a domestic rather than a global problem, they are less fit for office than they claim to be and are misled as to their potential powers, in the same way as were the courtiers of King Canute—</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall finish this passage before I give way to the hon. Gentleman. King Canute, that excellent monarch, sits metaphorically on the Government Benches. I acknowledge that it is ancillary to our debate, but the clock that strikes 13 not only contradicts itself, but casts doubt on all its other utterances. Opposition Members have quoted statistics on housing conditions in their constituencies; I reiterate what I said on Second Reading, that in Westminster, in the last month for which there are detailed figures, the statutorily homeless were, on average, found permanent housing within 15 weeks, whereas those in the city council's care in category A were housed in 46 weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was provoked to my feet by the right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke)—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for not giving way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is all very well to castigate the Opposition for complaining about the Government fostering job insecurity by saying that it is happening in the rest of the world. The problem is that in the rest of the world it is far more common to rent property. The Government have pressed both for job insecurity and for people to buy their houses with mortgages. That is how the problem has developed—the two do not go well together. The right hon. Gentleman castigates my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich, but it may be necessary to return to a world in which many more people rent their property, given that there is increasing job insecurity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I failed to give way to the hon. Gentleman, but I take his observation seriously, and I shall take advantage of my reference to King Canute. The map devoted to hair colour in the Reader's Digest atlas shows that, 1,000 years later, there is an absolutely precise correlation between hair colour and how far the Vikings advanced. As a nation, we have been remarkably immobile over the whole of the millennium.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Follow that. I feel a little like a Viking going into battle. I find the subject difficult, because I am so terribly angry about it, and I cannot express my anger as much as I would like to.<br><br>
I welcome the Minister's two positive responses to criticisms that we have made. First, two years is obviously better than one. I have said that before, but I want to emphasise it, especially given the Minister's generosity towards my amendment this morning. Secondly, I was interested to hear what he said about 10-year leases. When local authorities are trying to find accommodation that they lease on a temporary basis, the fact that people may rent it for only one or two years means that it is difficult to get that property into a reasonable condition. The 10-year lease will mean that the quality of the accommodation will be greatly increased.<br><br>
I do not know whether the Minister will speak in any detail about the proposed Government amendments, but I want to ask a couple of specific questions before I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0444">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 783</span>
add what will probably be my final comments before we leave this main part of the Bill. First, I seek clarification on amendment No. 455. Will the duty cease when the local authority is satisfied that suitable accommodation is offered rather than when suitable accommodation is offered? If so, that would be a lower test. Secondly, Government amendment No. 457 suggests that a council's duty ceases if tenants leave voluntarily, even if it would not be reasonable for them to continue to occupy the property, and I should like some clarification on that.<br><br>
I shall give the Minister and his advisers a minute or two to reflect, as I want to finish by trying to bring home to the Government the effect of their proposals on people who move homes, a subject on which the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate was eloquent. Between the ages of 11 and 18, I lived in seven different privately rented forms of accommodation—I shall not go into the reasons why. I am pleased to say that all those properties were reasonable, and I was lucky to be able to stay at the same grammar school throughout. However, I can hardly express the peer pressure I experienced to explain why I was leading such a peculiar life, which had to do with all sorts of personal complications in my mother's married status. I did not want to have to go into reasons—it does not worry me now, as I am 51, those things are long past, and I shall have been married for 30 years next year. It was incredibly difficult at the time, however, and those are the types of pressure on teenagers that the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate described so clearly in asking what will happen to families. That is what happens when people get on the merry-go-round. I was fortunate, because I had all sorts of support from a good school and elsewhere. There are those that do not have such means of support and young people today perhaps face more difficulties than they did in my young days—there are more ways in which they can get into trouble.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will consider the matter carefully. He had put his case rationally; he is a man to whom his personal and intellectual integrity is important and he has tried to make his argument reasonably. I respect that, but he has not convinced me or other Opposition Members—or the people outside on whose behalf we have advanced our arguments. There can be no greater need than being without a home.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will try to answer the technical question posed by the hon. Member for Christchurch. Amendment No. 457 would apply the duty where someone leaves voluntarily. Someone in accommodation that it would not be reasonable for them to continue to occupy would not be leaving voluntarily. I hope that that clarifies the matter.<br><br>
I shall start with a few remarks about the comments of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts). I do not regard homeless people as deserving of punishment. I believe that people are homeless for a mixture of reasons. Some are homeless because of foolishness, stupidity and incompetence and some are homeless because of circumstances that have overwhelmed them. Homeless people are a cross-section of people, as one finds in most walks of life. My purpose is not to attribute any moral characteristics or even characteristics of competence to them, but to try to find
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 784</span>
a way in which to help such people within the framework of the resources that are available to me and the collective responsibility that governs Government policies.<br><br>
I do not claim moral exclusiveness and say that my concern is greater than anyone else's. I have a duty to fulfil when defending legislation from the ministerial Bench and I shall fulfil it. I have done my best to introduce legislation that will deliver what the Government want it to deliver. That is why I have not hesitated to recommend some changes to the Committee. I have promised that we will include the allocation criteria in the Bill. The arguments about the inadequacy of a one-year duty seemed fair and I therefore made the duty two years. It seemed to me that there was a case for trying to make private sector leasing arrangements with local authorities work more effectively and, therefore, I have said that I will begin discussions with local authorities about mechanisms whereby we can extend the period to 10 years, as soon as I can. The Committee will have to take me on trust; if it does not, that is my misfortune.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the misfortune is not the Minister's or that of anyone sitting in the Room; the misfortune is that of families who have no home.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that anything that I said suggested that I did not believe that to be the case. Some time ago, we unveiled a policy initiative for which I claim authorship, at least in respect of its latest phase, and, I must say, an especial pride—the rough sleepers initiative, which helps people in the worst circumstances. We have delivered that initiative and it has been widely accepted and welcomed by voluntary organisations. I regard the work of those organisations—I include Shelter, with which I sometimes disagree, in this—as admirable and necessary. We could not deliver that policy without their co-operation and I hope that that co-operation will continue. Having been continually described in Committee as rational, I wanted for a few moments to put something more personal on the record.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman intervenes, I must say that I was not going to draw any conclusions about what he thought about me personally.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving way and accept his assurances that he has no moral agenda on the matter, but does he equally accept that the changes to the homelessness legislation are on an agenda set by some of his hon. Friends that clearly has a moralistic tone? We, in the Opposition could hardly miss that. Secondly, will he also accept that the impact of the changes will create greater hardship for homeless families than the current situation?</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the genesis of a particular policy, my job is to try to make the proposal work effectively. Whatever qualities hon. Members, irrespective of which side they sit on, bring to these matters, that is their business. We are all conscious of the baggage that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0445">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 785</span>
hon. Members bring to particular issues. I merely want to lay out what my baggage is on this matter, which is not to pursue a particular moral agenda. No doubt when we come to the Bill on divorce—the Family Law Bill, which is due to be debated before the recess—hon. Members on both sides of the House will be able to show how difficult it is sometimes to distinguish, from the baggage that they bring with them, between a particular set of moral precepts and practical precepts. I do not want to be too philosophical, Mr. Me William.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the Minister will not be because, for a start, it does not arise from the clause, and secondly, I am in the middle of that dilemma right now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. McWilliam.<br><br>
Let us get one thing clear. The Bill will not change the supply of social housing so the proposals will have no effect on the number of families allocated to social housing in a given year. What may change are the households that get the accommodation. Our proposals will ensure that families with the greatest long-term housing need will get the available housing. I believe that there are some families whose lot will be improved. Opposition Members cite their surgery cases of people with homelessness problems. I have those too—they are not the exclusive preserve of the urban environment. We all know of people who say, "I have been on the list for ages and whenever I think I am just about to get a house, something goes wrong." The purpose of the proposed legislation is to find a common basis for the assessment of need.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I challenge the Minister on his technical point that the proposal will not reduce the supply of social housing? For every four or five allocations to people on the housing list, only one allocation from the pool is lost because of the time taken for the process of people moving and so on, whereas a homeless person moving from temporary to permanent accommodation does so straight away. When someone is rehoused from a waiting list, the number of allocations is reduced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an argument for saying that we should find another method of direct allocations into social housing because the waiting-list principle itself has inherent problems. I shall have to study the hon. Gentleman's remarks before conceding his point. I should make the point that people who are on the waiting list long term also suffer trauma—it is not exclusively the preserve of people who are homeless for whatever reason.<br><br>
I do not believe that private sector accommodation is quite so wicked as some people think. The average tenure is three years or so, involving 2 million households. Two thirds of landlords have at least one tenant who is on benefit. I cannot understand why private landlords would want to turn people out repeatedly—it is not in their interests. In many cases, there are particular arrangements with the local authority.<br><br>
There does not seem to be a way of bridging the divide between us. I believe that we need to provide
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 786</span>
emergency help; assess needs on a common basis; and award housing on that assessment. The hon. Members for Greenwich and for Christchurch, in slightly different ways, maintain that people who become homeless have a right to permanent accommodation by a different route from others. I do not believe that, so I must defend my amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are disappointed by the Minister's response. He did not give a rational or logical justification for rejecting amendment No. 506. He talked about Government policy and their view on the single waiting list, but he did not provide a single, clear reason for rejecting our amendment, which would do what he has been trying to do, namely, mitigate the worst effects of the legislation that he inherited.<br><br>
I remind him that amendment No. 506 simply says that an authority
<br><blockquote><p>"shall secure that accommodation is available for occupation by the applicant, and they shall take reasonable steps thereafter to secure that accommodation does not cease to be available".</p></blockquote>
We believe that that policy is right. People should be assisted into secure accommodation and should not be put into a position of continuing insecurity. Many of my hon. Friends have spoken movingly about the damaging impact on families of constant insecurity, constant moves and the inability to put down roots. We have not had a satisfactory answer to that. In fact, we have had no answer at all.<br><br>
The Government know that what they are doing is wrong, but they seek to justify it by referring to the wider concept of a single waiting list as a route of entry into social housing. They imply that that will be fairer to people on the waiting list who, the Minister intimated, would have more chance of getting housed. If the Minister is right, fewer homeless people will be housed. However, I do not accept his premise. His assumption that somehow there will be no change in supply—that it will be merely a matter of adjustment between different routes—is wrong. We know what the Government are doing. They have cut the housing programme remorselessly in recent years. We have seen the Housing Corporation budget cut by £300 million last year and by £300 million the year before that. We have seen the local authority housing investment programme cut again and again. Output of social housing is at its lowest level since the end of the war. By weakening the obligations to the homeless, all that we will do is provide the Treasury with more excuses to cut the housing programme even further. The Bill will merely open the way for more cuts in the housing programme and fewer homes for everyone, whether they are on the waiting list or homeless. It does not wash to say that the Bill is simply a minor variation between categories of people who are obtaining housing. That will not be the case.<br><br>
The Bill will undermine the presumption that has been around for 20 years, which is accepted by everyone who understands the problems of the homeless or is involved in the business of providing practical relief to the homeless: that permanent accommodation is what most homeless families need and what they should receive.<br><br>

When the right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South, had given us his interesting and refreshing view of life in Belgravia earlier this morning, he supplied us with some attractive images of King Canute. The right hon. Gentleman must correct me if I am wrong, but I think he said that King Canute sat metaphorically on the Government Benches. I say that what happened to King Canute will happen to those on the Government Benches soon—a tide of public opinion will sweep them away.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise because of my respect for the hon. Gentleman. One of the most common misconceptions in English history is that King Canute himself thought that he could turn back the waves. He went to the water's edge to demonstrate to his courtiers that they were wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He still got wet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: that is right.<br><br>
The Minister is trying to put a reasonable face on an unreasonable Bill. He has been taken to the water's edge by those above him, who insist that legislation on homelessness must be changed. He is trying to say that things will not be so bad as we fear, and that he is concerned that there should be amelioration. But the tide is coming in. He will get wet, along with the advisers who have put him in that position. They will all get wet, because this is one of the most unpopular measures that has been introduced by a profoundly unpopular Government, who have earned the contempt of the British public. Their attack on the homeless will be one of the reasons why they will be swept out of office at the next general election. I hope that between now and then, people considering legislation in another place will realise just how wrong the measure is and will try to achieve what we have sought to achieve today, to prevent these ill-conceived measures from coming into effect. It is still possible to change the Bill and restore the original intention of the 1977 Act which, as I have said on many occasions, enjoyed cross-party support and has stood the test of time. It has been reviewed by the Government twice before and was found to be working well. The review concluded that it should continue to operate.<br><br>
There is no justification for the Government's actions. We shall press amendment No. 506 as strongly as any of the other amendments that we have pressed in the Committee because we know that its proposals are correct. We hope that the framework that it establishes will be restored sooner rather than later because it is the right framework for the relief of homelessness.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 509, in page 79, line 9, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"The notification shall also inform the applicant of his right to request a review of the decision".</p></blockquote></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Prentice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are trying to secure that where the local authority ceases to have a duty to house, it must ensure that the people concerned are given notice and that applicants are given reasons. There are several circumstances in which the local authority might cease to have a duty to house. People might cease to be eligible because of a change in immigration status, because they have become homeless intentionally, or because they have accepted or refused an offer of per-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0447">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 789</span>
manent accommodation. There seems to be no necessity to inform a person of a reason for denying accommodation in the example of someone accepting an offer of permanent housing, but for the other examples, an explanation is required.<br><br>
If a person ceases to be eligible, the authority should ensure that it has all the relevant facts to hand. That is important so that the authority does not base its decision on hearsay but on proper information. It is also important should the applicant want to appeal at a later stage.<br><br>
If a person is judged to have become intentionally homeless, it is important that the decision be properly assessed. There has been extensive litigation on home-lessness and much of it has centred on intentionality. However, a person may have good reasons for refusing an offer of accommodation. For example, the condition of the property offered may be disgusting; I am sure that all hon. Members have encountered examples of people being offered poor accommodation that they could not be expected to move into and call home.<br><br>
Another reason may be that the property offered is in an inappropriate location. I our previous debate, examples were given of people being worried about moving to a home whose location would disrupt their children's schooling. I shall not go into the details as I want to raise that problem at greater length in connection with a later amendment. However, the disruption to schooling caused by inadequate accommodation being offered outside the area in which a child has hitherto been educated is so serious that it damages that child's social skills as well as his or her educational success.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
People may be offered accommodation that is near the dwelling of someone who has been violent or threatened violence to them. It is important that people are not forced to move into such circumstances. My own local authority, Lewisham, makes a point of not offering people accommodation that is close to where they have suffered or been threatened with violence.<br><br>
In those circumstances, it is right that the authorities should conduct a review and make the reasons for a decision clear to applicants. That will prevent the applicant from wasting time making further applications that will get nowhere. It will also allow applicants to challenge the decisions properly, if they feel that that is necessary. Finally, it is in the spirit of open government that as much information as possible should be given to applicants so that they can make proper and reasoned decisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 508 and 509 suggest that if an applicant refuses an offer of suitable accommodation made during the two-year duty by the authority under part VI, the applicant should be entitled to know the reasons for the decision and of his right of appeal.<br><br>
I am not sure that there should be a specific provision covering the giving of reasons because the circumstances should make the reasons self-evident. However, I agree that a person should be made aware of his right of appeal. A well-run authority would tell people of that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 790</span>
right anyway, but I accept the logic of putting a duty to do so in the Bill.<br><br>
We need to look at precisely what is required in the light of other amendments to the clause, so I cannot accept the amendments in their present form. However, I shall consider the matter further if the hon. Lady is willing to withdraw the amendments. If necessary, I shall return to the problem on Report.<br><br>
I cannot accept amendment No. 510, as it would turn a two-year duty into something close to a continuing duty. I shall not rehearse the debate that we have just had, but I am willing to consider amendments Nos. 508 and 509.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the basis that the Minister's response amounts to an away draw rather than a home win, I beg to ask to leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment made:</i> No. 458, in page 79, line 15, leave out from beginning to end of line 16 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"A person who ceases to be owed the duty under this section".—[<i>Mr. Curry.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 511, in page 79, line 18, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(9) Where the duty under this section is owed to a person for whom the housing authority is satisfied that temporary accommodation is inappropriate they shall have a duty to ensure that an offer of permanent accommodation under part VI is made to the applicant as soon as is practicable.".</p></blockquote>
I move the amendment to try to salvage something from the Bill for some homeless families. It may also salvage something for the Minister, who has made a number of statements that do not appear to be supported by any provision in the Bill. If the Minister were to accept the amendment, it would give local authorities the power that, on a number of occasions, he has suggested that they have.<br><br>
All hon. Members can identify certain homeless families or homeless individuals for whom temporary accommodation offered under clause 151 would be inappropriate. It is not too difficult to think of examples, but I will provide one or two. I am sure that the Minister will be able to think of others.<br><br>
Extremely vulnerable elderly people, perhaps in their 80s, might be owed a duty under clause 151. They might want accommodation but might have to spend time in hospital now and again. They might be ill or disabled. It would be completely unreasonable to suggest that such people should go into temporary accommodation in the hope that something permanent might come up in two or three years' time. That is not reasonable and I am sure that even the Minister would not try to defend an authority having to put such people into temporary accommodation. The right thing would be to rehouse them permanently.<br><br>
A further example involves a family in which the woman might be pregnant or there might be two or three young children. To ask such a family to go into temporary accommodation, with the prospect that per-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0448">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 791</span>
manent accommodation might materialise just as the new baby is born or when it is very young, is unreasonable. The right thing to do in such circumstances would be to give power to the authority to make an offer of permanent accommodation
<br><blockquote><p>"as soon as is practicable."</p></blockquote>
Those words are also used in the Bill. The authority does not have to find the family the first house available, over and above anyone else on the housing list. It must come to a reasonable decision, but it should have the power to do so.<br><br>
People with learning disabilities might find it difficult to settle down in a home. They might find it difficult to come to terms with their new neighbourhood and environment. I have such a constituent who has settled into a new home in the past couple of years. It took him time but he eventually settled down with great support from his neighbours who offer him a framework of contacts and help. That has enabled him to lead a pretty normal life in the community. For him to be faced with the prospect of uprooting himself after two years and moving on somewhere else is not reasonable, fair or humane, but the local authority might have no power, as I understand the Bill, to do anything other than provide him with temporary accommodation.<br><br>
On several occasions, the Minister gave examples of where local authorities might be able to offer permanent accommodation immediately. The Minister spoke about authorities somehow being able to top up homeless people near the top of the housing list with a few extra points or a little extra priority to give them a house straightaway. He referred to that on at least two occasions that I can recollect. Again, I suggest that the Bill contains no power to allow an authority to do that. The amendment would give the authority the possibility of incorporating just such an arrangement into its allocation policy.<br><br>
The Minister also raised the case of a homeless family who might have points removed by being placed in temporary accommodation under the allocations policy. That would be wrong. He mentioned a case concerning the Institute of Housing, and the amendment would deal with that by giving the authority the power to cope with such a situation.<br><br>
On the Belgravia gas explosion case to which we keep returning, it might not be the duke whose house is blown up, but that of the dustman next door—the right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South mentioned that. It might be appropriate for the dustman to be given permanent accommodation if his house had been totally destroyed or was irrepairable. The dustman might live in private accommodation, rather than in local authority accommodation.<br><br>
In all those cases, it might be absolutely right for permanent accommodation to be offered to the applicant as soon as is practicable. The amendment covers all the cases and would allow the Minister to make his statement with the assurance that there is a power in the Bill to support him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not need the amendment. The Bill gives me the necessary power. I would not have made the statement had I not been confident that it did. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 792</span>
amendment uses the word "temporary", which can mean all sorts of different things to different people. After all, there are 2 million households on assured short-hold tenancies, which are temporary by the definitions of the measure. I fear that the hon. Gentleman seeks to create a direct route to permanent accommodation. I am sorry, but I cannot accept his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell us what provision in the Bill gives the power to make an offer of permanent accommodation to someone who is nearly but not quite at the top of the list before someone with more points?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will write to the hon. Gentleman with the details, which I am sure he will find very useful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but the Minister's reply disappoints me. He has not said which provision in the Bill gives the power to offer permanent accommodation. He has not dealt with any of the points about people who are extremely vulnerable, but for whom temporary accommodation may not be suitable, or with the point about the local authority having no power. I shall press the amendment to a vote.</span></p>
