	<time>Thursday 15 February 1996</time>
	<p>[MR. JOHN MCWILLIAM 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Housing Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration (Mr. David Curry)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. In the 	<i>Official Report</i> of Standing Committee G on Tuesday 13 February 1996 at column 76, I am reported as saying that the voluntary purchase grant scheme will be introduced in April next year. To set the record straight, the voluntary scheme will, in fact, start in April 1996—this calendar year, but the next financial year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Curry. That was not really a point of order for me. Do you have a point of order, Mr. Raynsford?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Raynsford 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. Widespread concern has been voiced outside the House about clauses 41 to 48. They relate to the powers of the manager who can be appointed by the Housing Corporation and the effect of transfer orders that can be made by the corporation. Both powers could affect the assets and the potential income from rents of housing associations. They have prompted widespread fears among lending institutions that their security on loans to housing associations will be compromised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measures have spread alarm among lenders to the housing association movement. I am told that two bond issues that were expected to be announced in the coming weeks have had to be withdrawn. There is also concern about increasing margins on loans to housing associations which, in turn, would have a serious impact on the rents charged to associations. Action must be taken without delay to deal with the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we reach clause 41—the first of the offending clauses—will you allow us to have a substantive debate on the matter so that we can put our case for the withdrawal from the Bill of clauses 41 to 48 as currently drafted? That withdrawal is a necessary precondition for the restoration of confidence in the lending market for housing associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will explain what action the Government intend to take to deal with the situation that has been created by the maladroit way in which the provisions were drafted. I hope also that he will accept that the clauses are seriously defective and that they will need to be either withdrawn or amended substantially. If they are to be so amended, we want to know when the Committee will have an opportunity to consider such amendments, as we clearly cannot do so today. Such issues go to the heart of the social housing programme and it is essential that we have an opportunity to deal with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The substantive point of order for me is whether to allow a full debate on clause 41. That
	<span class='label label-info column'>152</span>
depends entirely on whether all the issues arising from the clause are explored under the amendments. If they are, precedent states that a debate on clause stand part will not be granted. If they are not explored, the precedent is that the clause stand part debate will be granted. The matter is in the hands of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I am content with your ruling. I shall speak about the matter when we reach the relevant clauses and, I think, enable the Committee to deal with the problem. I have discussed the matter and I shall outline to the Committee a way in which it should proceed to take account of the difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the interests of saving a person's reputation, I wish to point out that 	<i>The Guardian</i> in its article this morning about the Bill refers to the concerns expressed by Barry Ainger, the chief executive of the Housing Finance Corporation. The Committee may be interested to know that Barry Ainger is, in fact, Barbara Ainger and, as far as I know, not a cross-dresser.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I wonder whether you can help. You are instructed to ensure an orderly debate. As I understood him, the Minister said that he would have to suggest to the Committee that one of the clauses dealing with transfer orders should somehow be changed. You will have noted, Mr. McWilliam, that we have been given many such undertakings. That is welcome, but it will make a farce of the Report stage because, as well as having to consider hundreds of Government amendments, we shall want to debate further a small number of issues on which the Committee is deeply divided. I have often argued that we should consider using a rare procedure—the recommittal of a Bill to deal with technical amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government continue making such changes to the Bill, Mr. McWilliam, will you use your good offices to persuade the Government that the Bill should be recommitted? If you cannot persuade the Government to consider doing that, surely the Government should table amendments that they know will have to be made before we reach the clause in question, rather than tabling amendments on Report as a result of undertakings given to the Opposition in Committee. The Government too often say, "The clause is a shambles; we will take it away and bring it back on Report."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will you use your good offices to ensure that, if the Bill is in such a mess at the end of the Committee stage, it is recommitted—presumably to this Committee—so that we can deal with the technical amendments efficiently, rather than engaging in long debates on the Floor of the House on Report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The recommittal procedure is entirely a matter for hon. Members on the Floor of the House. It is not a matter for me. However, I must point out to the Committee that the Order of Consideration is amendable; it is for the Committee to decide what it wants to do. I shall listen carefully, as I always do, to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0094">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>153</span>
any motions or amendments that are proposed. The Order of Consideration is not set in stone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Clauses 27 and 28 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 2</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>RECOVERY, ETC. OF SOCIAL HOUSING GRANTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 97, in page 17, line 21, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) The principles to be determined under subsection 2 of this section shall require that a registered social landlord shall use an amount of a kind specified in paragraph (b) of that subsection in pursuance of its purposes and objects, in accordance with section 2 of this Part.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 99, in clause 30, page 18, line 18, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) In section 52 of that Act (recovery, etc. of grants), after subsection (2) insert—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'(2A) The principles to be determined under subsection 2 of this section shall require that a registered social landlord may use the amounts specified in subsection (1) above in pursuance of its purposes and objects, in accordance with section 2 of the Housing Act 1966.'.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 97 is a small and essentially technical amendment. It deals with property publicly funded by grant that is sold or transferred to a non-social housing use. Control must be exercised over the proceeds of sales in such situations because public funds have been involved. We believe that it is generally most sensible if that money is recycled for social housing purposes by the association involved, rather than repaid to the Housing Corporation. The Government have made it clear in their approach to the voluntary purchase grant and the right to buy for housing associations that the principle of recycling is entirely acceptable for housing associations, which are required to use the proceeds of sales for future investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment proposes that the Housing Corporation should make such determinations in a way that ensures that money from sales that is retained is used for the main purposes and objects of the housing association or other social landlord. Although it would be unusual for an association to act in any other way, we believe that such a safeguard is necessary to ensure that the money is used for the purposes for which the organisation was set up. That is the purpose of amendment No. 97. Amendment No. 99 parallels those provisions and seeks to ensure that the Housing Corporation directs that social landlords should use the proceeds of sale when public money has been made available by grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are small and technical; they would improve the Bill; we move them in the same spirit as we moved several amendments last week, and I hope that the Minister will be able to accept them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. James Clappison)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the spirit in which the hon. Gentleman moved the amendment and I entirely accept his
	<span class='label label-info column'>154</span>
underlying point, but the amendment would not improve the Bill and is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 29 is similar to section 52 of the Housing Act 1988, which allows the recovery of housing association grant in the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman outlined. An important difference between the two is that section 52 of the 1988 Act does not enable the corporation to allow landlords to retain recoverable grant and use it for purposes that the corporation specifies, while the Bill will do so. Clause 29(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Corporation may … direct the registered social landlord to apply or appropriate for such purposes as the Corporation may specify … such amount as the Corporation may specify."</p></blockquote>
That will enable grant to be recycled for reuse by registered social landlords. An important feature that the hon. Gentleman will have noticed is that grant must be applied or appropriated
	<br><blockquote><p>"for such purposes as the Corporation may specify."</p></blockquote>
Two points arise from that. First, it is unlikely that the corporation would want grant to be used for purposes other than social housing. Secondly, the registered social landlord will still be bound by the objects and purposes for which grant can be used set out in clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that the amendment is unnecessary. The important point is that the corporation is given power to direct social landlords as to how to use grant in the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman outlined. Registered social landlords will be able to reuse grant, but only under the direction of the corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my remarks have satisfied the hon. Gentleman and persuaded him that, although I understand the spirit behind the amendment, it is unnecessary and would not improve the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the Minister's comments, and with a view to making progress—there are more substantive points to be discussed—I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 29 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 30</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>GRANTS UNDER SECTIONS 50 TO 55 OF THE HOUSING ACT 1988</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 98, in page 18, line 17, leave out 'immediately' and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"within any of the three years".</p></blockquote>
This is another small and technical amendment that relates to the payment of revenue deficit grant to a small number of housing associations. Revenue deficit grant dates back to the framework in place prior to the Housing Act 1988. I understand that a limited number of associations—about 10—still need that grant. It covers deficits that resulted from the arrangement for the financing of housing association development that applied between 1974 and 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the provisions of the clause, only associations receiving revenue deficit grant immediately prior to the Bill's enactment will qualify for its continuation. An association that may qualify for grant may not have been receiving it at that time, because varying financial circumstances mean that associations move in and out
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0095">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>155</span>
of entitlement. The amendment would simply allow a slightly wider remit, so that associations receiving grant
	<br><blockquote><p>"within any of the three years"</p></blockquote>
prior to enactment would be eligible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is sensible, practical and not far-reaching, and I hope that the Minister will feel able to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the principle behind the amendment, which is that associations that apply periodically for grant but are not claiming it in the year of commencement should not be penalised. The wording of the clause needs to be looked at again. I shall leave the matter on the basis that I will return to the amendment at a later stage, and invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We note, once again, the need for rephrasing. I fear that if the Under-Secretary pursues that line, he will become as unpopular with the civil servants as the Minister. However, we want to make progress and there are other matters to discuss, so I will not get into a debate about how it is possible to rephrase the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"within any of the three years"</p></blockquote>
to make them neater. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 100, in page 18, line 18, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) In paragraph (2)c) of section 52 of that Act (recovery, &c of grants), after the word 'association' there shall be inserted the words—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'to apply or appropriate for such purposes as the Corporation may specify, or'.".</p></blockquote>
This is another technical amendment. We seek to ensure consistency in the arrangements for the recovery of social housing grant under the Housing Act 1988 and the arrangements under the Bill. Clause 29(2)(b) provides that the corporation may
	<br><blockquote><p>"direct the registered social landlord to apply … for such purposes as the Corporation may specify, or to pay to the Corporation, such amount as the Corporation may specify"</p></blockquote>
when a grant-funded property is sold or a similar event occurs. That is an entirely sensible provision to ensure the best value for money from funds that have been advanced from the public purse and the best decision-taking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, for example, the alternatives were to sell the property in poor condition and repay housing association grant or to seek more grant to repair the properties, an association is likely to opt for the latter, whatever is the best value for money in public terms. If sale proceeds can be used to produce a property that is better suited to current needs, better economic decision-taking will result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is our wish that the provisions under the Bill—which will be the Housing Act 1996 if it reaches the statute book—should be paralleled by provisions under the 1988 Act, and the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the two are compatible. As I stressed earlier, this is a sensible and practical amendment and I hope that the Government will have no difficulty in accepting
	<span class='label label-info column'>156</span>
the principle, even if they have difficulty with the wording.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the amendment. Like amendment No. 99, it would allow landlords to recycle grants for purposes specified by the corporation. The public interest in seeing grants recycled for appropriate purposes would be protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the risk of the hon. Gentleman making further comments about my relative popularity in various quarters, I would draw his attention to the fact that the amendment relates to the 1988 Act legislation, whereas amendment No. 97 dealt with clause 29 of the Bill. He will understand that, for that reason, the amendment will need to be considered more carefully. Without making the hon. Gentleman any promises, I can say that we will consider his point and possibly return to it later. He appreciates that the amendment refers to an earlier piece of legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to accept the Minister's assurances and, on this occasion, I will not hold the drafting against him because the amendment deals with earlier legislation from a time when he was not in a position of responsibility. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 102, in page 18, line 24, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3A) In section 55 of that Act (surplus rental income), for subsection (1) (associations to show surpluses arising from increased rental income in their accounts) substitute—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1) An association or social landlord to which this section applies, that is to say, a registered housing association in Scotland or a registered social landlord in England and Wales which has at any time received a payment in respect of—
	<ol>
	<li>a grant under section 41 of the 1985 Act or any enactment replaced by that section, or</li>
	<li>a grant under section 2(2) of the Housing (Scotland) Act</li></ol>
1988, (in this section referred to as a 'relevant grant') shall show separately in its accounts for any period ending after the coming into force of this section the surpluses arising from increased rental income during that period from such housing activities to which the grant relates as the Secretary of State may from time to time determine'.".</p></blockquote>
This is another technical amendment, but a slightly more complex one. I hope that the Committee will bear with me as I try to outline in detail the purposes of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until 1988, when the current financial arrangements for the funding of housing associations were introduced, the housing association grants were calculated in a way that would meet most of the capital costs of a scheme. The calculation worked out what loan was required and what proportion of that loan could be serviced out of the rental income. The capital housing association grant met the rest of the costs of the scheme. That was a first-year calculation and in some ways it was unsatisfactory because, as rents rose with inflation, the return that the association was getting from its rents increased whereas loan repayment charges remained constant and schemes began to show an increasing surplus year on year. Against that background, the Government established a system known as the grant redemption fund to claw back future surpluses arising from those publicly-funded arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0096">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>157</span>
In the Housing Act 1988, the same arrangements were re-enacted with a change of name from the grant redemption fund to the rent surplus fund. Section 55 of the 1988 Act provides that those arrangements will apply to schemes funded by housing association grant, but the 1988 Act brought in a different approach. Associations were expected to borrow privately, possibly on low start or index-linked terms, with rising loan repayments, therefore, often matching the rising rental income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, associations had to make future provision for major repairs out of scheme income whereas in earlier schemes they could return to the Housing Corporation for more housing association grant to cover those costs. Grant rates were set at progressively lower rates, from an average of about 75 per cent, of scheme costs in the early days of the 1988 Act regime to a current average of 58 per cent. As grant rates reduced, rents inevitably had to bear an increasing proportion of the costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The result of the new equation was that associations were not expected to make significant surpluses on the schemes developed after 1988 in the same way that they were able to do on schemes developed between 1974 and 1988. Thus, the rent surplus fund rules determined by the Housing Corporation have always specifically excluded such schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purposes of the amendment, which is designed to amend section 55 of the 1988 Act, is to recognise that reality. There is no purpose in leaving on the statute book a provision dealing with rent surpluses which applies equally to schemes developed under the 1988 Act as to previous ones. That reference is dropped. Equally, there would be no purpose in introducing reference to schemes funded under the new social housing grant provisions under clause 17 of the Bill. The bidding for grant under the Bill will be at least as competitive as the bidding for housing association grant in the past and the principles of no material future surpluses remain as before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a sensible amendment to reflect the changing circumstances, to ensure that there is a consistent approach to the recovery of surpluses and to avoid anomalies being created. I hope that the Minister, in the same spirit that he has adopted towards previous amendments, will accept the amendment. We might expect a change in wording which, I grant him, is far more complex in this than in previous cases. There is far more scope for error on our part, but I hope that at least the spirit of the amendment will be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may assist the Committee if I go into the background to the amendment. Under section 55 of the 1988 Act, the Housing Corporation can require registered landlords to establish accounts showing surpluses arising from rent income on housing built with grant. The hon. Gentleman has gone into the background to that. It also has the potential to claim back part or all of those surpluses. In practice, surpluses arising from houses built before the 1988 Act provisions came into force have been ring fenced: they have been retained by housing associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>158</span>
Amendments Nos. 101 and 102 are complicated by the treatment of Scotland, which is not the subject of this part of the Bill, but, in essence, they would confine the operation of the rent surplus fund provision, by law, to pre-1988 stock. We have no plans to change the current arrangements, although we shall need to return to the issue of long-term surpluses if there is future legislation to bring in profit-making landlords. As the Government have no plans to change the current regime, I have no difficulty with the thrust of the amendments. The Committee will realise that I cannot speak for Scotland. I shall therefore need to consider how an amendment might best be framed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman has conceded, this is a complicated and technical subject and it introduces provisions in earlier legislation that were not originally included in the Bill. If the hon. Gentleman withdraws the amendment, I shall consider the position with the intention of tabling an amendment on Report should we be able to find a suitable formulation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Diana Maddock 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 126, in page 19, line 24, at end insert—

	<li>provide reasonable time for the notice to be complied with;</li>
	<li>be recorded in the register of social landlords.".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
If, under its regulatory function, the Housing Corporation issues a notice requesting documents to provide information, the amendment would mean that it would need to specify the purpose of that request and to whom the information would be disclosed. The amendment would require the Housing Corporation to give people reasonable time to comply with the notice, which would be recorded in the register of social landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments reflect concern about the lack of checks and balances in some of the Housing Corporations's proposed new powers. The amendment would not place an onerous set of processes on the corporation, but it would mean that the new and enhanced power to obtain information would be exercised following due consideration and that the information would be required for a specific purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many social landlords fear that the Housing Corporation may use its powers on a scattergun basis, requiring a great deal of information for not very clear purposes. That would add to the costs of housing associations. They already face significant costs that are passed on to tenants. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My main aim is to ensure that the corporation's powers are used sensibly and that undue extra costs are not passed on to housing associations. The amendment seeks to provide extra checks and balances. I hope that the Minister can reassure us that he is happy to take them on board. The amendment is five lines long, so the Minister has plenty of scope to reword it should he so wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Lady's concern to avoid unnecessary procedure and complication.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invite the hon. Lady to consider carefully the procedures that are already in the clause and to consider the background, which is important. She will appreciate that the Housing Corporation, in the performance of its functions as the funder and regulator of registered social landlords, requires a range of information from landlords. Social landlords acknowledge that registration places certain responsibilities on them to comply with reasonable requests from the corporation for information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the corporation is to perform its function of oversight of public funds paid to social landlords, it needs to have a power in reserve to enable it to enforce the provision of information if it considers that its reasonable requests are being resisted, or has reason to suspect that the information that it has been given is not accurate. The hon. Lady's amendment is unnecessary. Landlords will generally be more than content to meet reasonable requests. However, should the corporation meet with resistance from landlords when it comes to supplying information, it will endeavour to resolve the matter without recourse to the issue of a notice. In those circumstances, social landlords will be fully aware of the corporation's concerns and what it is seeking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I am making answers that, because it is likely that the corporation will have been discussing with the landlord the information that it wants. It will be self-evident to the landlord why that information is wanted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invited the hon. Members for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford) and for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock) to consider the safeguards that were already provided by clause 32(1)(a). The hon. Lady will see that the notice will have to specify certain information. A notice under clause 32 might also require the landlord
	<br><blockquote><p>"to produce to a person authorised by the Corporation, at a time and place specified in the notice, any documents relating to the affairs of the registered social landlord".</p></blockquote>
That procedure makes it clear what the corporation will be seeking from the registered social landlord. The hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>160</span>
Lady should also take into account that the defence of reasonable excuse would be available to the landlord under a later clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady also raised the matter of the register, which has been subject to wider debate. However, given the procedures that have already been arranged, and the steps to be required of the corporation for serving notice on the social landlord, the further procedures that the amendment seeks to impose are unnecessary and a complication.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Clause 33 provides that anyone who fails to comply with an order under clause 32 is guilty of an offence.

	<span class='label label-info column'>161</span>
proposed change provides yet another example of the cack-handed drafting, presentation and progress through Committee of the Bill. The Government have already withdrawn three clauses from their own Bill and now propose to withdraw a substantial subsection, purely because of changes in their policy on the availability of housing association grant, or social housing grant, as it will become known, to profit-making organisations. When the Government decided not to proceed with that, they clearly forgot to remove subsection (4), which provides for the withdrawal of tax relief grant from non-charitable housing associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

I suspect that you, Mr. McWilliam, have sat on these Benches on occasions when it has taken a Committee several weeks to get beyond clause 1 of a Bill. There are advantages for the Government in such a situation: they can make sure that the rest of the Bill is in order and then table amendments to it. They then look as if they know what they are doing. An alternative to holding up consideration of a Bill on clause 1 or clause 2 is for the Government to suggest that the Committee adjourns for a week or a fortnight. They can get their draftspersons to sort out all the Bill's principles, after which they can table amendments to it and let the Committee proceed with its consideration in an orderly way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems ridiculous for the Government to make up the Bill as they go along. It looks as if someone is in the corridor, working on the amendments, as many Opposition Back-Benchers have to do. Are the Government hoping that it will be all right to think of an idea, write a few words down, stick them in the Bill and say a couple of prayers? That is not the way to proceed.

It would enable various bodies to give information to the Housing Corporation. That might be considered rather important by the Opposition. The original clause 33(4) would have put the commissioners of Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue in a special position as far as this permission was concerned, and would have restricted them somewhat. Government amendment No. 141 is putting those bodies on the same basis as the other Government bodies referred to in clause 34(2). I should have thought that the hon. Member for Denton

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 105 would allow the corporation to set different standards for different classes of registered social landlords, having regard to local circumstances. We agree that it is sensible for the corporation to be able to do that. The necessary power is, however, already embodied in clause 51(2), which makes general provision as to determinations. Therefore, amendment No. 105 is unnecessary.

Government amendment No. 142 recognises the duplication between clauses 36(2) and 51(2) and provides for the removal of subsection (2) from clause 36.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to do so, but first I wish to impress one point on the Minister. We sought to ensure that the amendment's wording referred to different classes of registered social landlords to avoid a situation developing in which different proceedings could apply to different associations or social landlords, even if those bodies might be broadly comparable in every other respect. That could lead to arbitrary discrimination and favouritism. I am sure that that would not happen, but we have a slight worry. Therefore, we wish to circumscribe any discrimination slightly by use of the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"classes of registered social landlords".</p></blockquote>
Clause 51 allows different provisions to be made for different registered social landlords or descriptions of registered social landlords. That seems to leave the matter very open: different provisions could apply even to organisations that were otherwise comparable. That would not be entirely satisfactory, and I hope that the Minister will say something about that before I seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is another small technical amendment that relates to the request for information from the Housing Corporation and the obligations on social landlords to respond to such requests. The procedure is right and proper and we simply wish to insert into die clause the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"following a reasonable length of time"</p></blockquote>
to ensure that requests, which may be complex and difficult, should not be made in a way that prevents the social housing landlord from replying within a reasonable time. There should not be a problem with the amendment. Obviously, there will be a discussion about the interpretation of the word "reasonable".

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not attracted to the amendment, because certain factors must be trusted to people's common sense.

We have not already had massive experience of them. People have built up a track record of common sense in such issues and I do not wish to insert legislative provision to circumscribe the use of that common sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, of course, a problem in determining what constitutes a reasonable time. If a landlord is a bit late in returning one of the corporation's forms, all he has to do is to telephone the corporation and say, for example, "We have a bit of bother here. The secretary is sick". That is self-evident. The corporation will not threaten the landlord with High Court action the next day; it will say, "Return the form as soon as you can". That is how the procedure works in practice. People intuitively know each other and know how the system works. The amendment is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This amendment refers to the different issue of establishing local housing companies, which we debated earlier. It would allow the Housing Corporation to delegate parts of its monitoring functions in respect of local housing companies or other registered social landlords that are set up by a local authority. It is widely accepted that, if local housing companies are to be successful, they must be established in a way which commands the confidence of the tenants and the relevant local authorities that set up the housing companies. That can be achieved by the authority playing a role in monitoring the activity of the local housing companies. Discussions have already taken place between the Housing Corporation, Ministers and other interested parties about a framework that would allow that to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to provide statutory backing for the delegation of the corporation's powers in this respect. We do not intend to remove the corporation's ultimate power as the regulator; the amendment would simply allow it to delegate some of the specific monitoring powers, which could be better discharged by a local authority. The amendment is sensible and practical and would help to establish local housing companies on a proper basis, which commands the confidence of all relevant parties. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The performance information collected by the corporation will be widely available and there is no reason why the corporation should not discuss it with the relevant local authorities if it thinks it sensible to do so.

Subject to any confidentiality restrictions, it can do what the amendment provides. Therefore, the amendment is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right that, with the advent of local housing companies, in which local authorities might have an interest, there might be a need to recast the monitoring role of local authorities and to consider how best the corporation and local authorities should collaborate in looking after their separate but related interest in the performance of those and other social landlords.

	<div class='title'>ISSUE OF GUIDANCE BY THE CORPORATION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 109, in page 22, line 34, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(cc) the management service and the landlord role in supporting vulnerable tenants to maintain their tenancies".</p></blockquote>
The spirit of amity is also giving the Opposition a lot of hard work. I do not know whether there is a record for the number of amendments moved, but perhaps the Committee is beginning to establish a reputation in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause sets out the powers of the Housing Corporation to issue guidance in respect of the management of housing accommodation by registered social landlords. Subsection (2), in particular, highlights certain areas on which the corporation may issue guidance
	<br><blockquote><p>"with respect to—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) the housing demands for which provision should be made".</p></blockquote>
That is interesting. May I be allowed a brief digression to remind the Committee of earlier debates in our proceedings about the corporation's need to appraise housing need? The Government said that that was unnecessary and opposed our amendment, voting it down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now find in clause 38(2)(a) that the corporation has to give guidance on
	<br><blockquote><p>"the housing demands for which provision should be made".</p></blockquote>
That leaves us slightly puzzled about what it will base the guidance on if it has not carried out a proper appraisal of the extent of housing needs which are supposed to be met. Be that as it may, I shall move on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2)(b) covers the allocation of housing accommodation. Subsection 2(c) covers the terms of tenancies and the principles on which levels of rent should be determined, which include the very important matter of affordability. Subsection (2)(d) covers standards of maintenance and repair and the means of achieving those standards and subsection (2)(e) covers consultation and communication with tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of that is fine, but there is one glaringly obvious omission, which is to do with the provision of support for vulnerable tenants to maintain their tenancies. There has been much public debate about the application of the care in the community policy and its failures. There is widespread public concern about people who are allocated properties without adequate support to enable them to maintain those homes and to be good neighbours to those living with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0101">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>167</span>
Often, that leads to unfortunate circumstances in which the people concerned may be a nuisance and a risk to their neighbours and a risk to themselves. It is vital to ensure that there is proper and appropriate support for vulnerable households.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why a specific amendment such as this one should be made to require the corporation, in giving guidance, to consider, among all the other matters that I have raised, the landlord's role in supporting vulnerable tenants to maintain their tenancies. This is not just a sensible and practical amendment, it is fundamental to good housing management and to ensuring that we minimise unforeseen and unfortunate circumstances in which people cause trouble to their neighbours and others simply because they have been put into the community without adequate support and proper care to enable them to act in a reasonable manner. This issue is extremely important and I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Ashby 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-West Lancashire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are entering an important area with this amendment. Under the provisions for the Housing Corporation to issue guidelines for housing management there is a requirement that it should issue draft proposed guidelines to the Secretary of State for his approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a need for great flexibility and we appreciate that housing associations provide housing for a great variety of people. I understand what the Opposition have to say about specific housing provided for those who are subject to care in the community, such as small groups of houses for people who have mental health problems. There are often misunderstandings among those around them, but they may subsequently find that those people acquire an interest in their neighbours and can be helpful. We are often talking about having good neighbours, rather than about housing management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be careful not to include in the guidance of the Housing Corporation matters concerning those who are looked after by social services and who are subject to various benefits, because social services must provide for them. We must be careful to separate the two issues, because if we do not, misunderstandings and problems could arise. I have no doubt that, in drafting its proposals for sheltered housing for those with mental health problems, the corporation will provide for the management to keep in close contact with the local social services and, in certain circumstances, to allow social services to have access. However, it cannot be proper to incorporate that in an amendment to the clause because it is a subject for the corporation's draft proposals for different types of housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My message is that we must not mix up social services matters with clause 38 as it related to the issue of guidance for housing management by the corporation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hanson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not disagree more with the view of the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (Mr. Ashby) that that matter is a problem solely for social services. The individuals who will be the subject of any guidance from the Housing Corporation will be living in socially rented housing and their landlords will surely have a responsibility to
	<span class='label label-info column'>168</span>
provide an input into solving any problems that may arise from social services misallocating tenancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich. In my constituency, a number of cases that relate to this issue have arisen in the past few months. In my area of north Wales, a major hospital—Denbigh hospital—has just been closed. Many of its former patients have been reallocated back into the community and found themselves in housing association properties. The guidance that my hon. Friend suggested for the Housing Corporation and for Tai Cymru would have been helpful in resettling such people with special needs back into the community. Such guidance would ensure that all parties are aware of the problems that can arise and it would provide a mechanism to help to resolve them
For example, it would help if there were guidance for social landlords on the assessment of certain individuals for particular types of housing. Of course, social services, health organisations and health authorities would also play a role and guidelines on how social landlords should liaise with such bodies would also be valuable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guidelines should also incorporate information on the support services that may be required. For example, when someone is allocated a social unit of housing for the first time, the Housing Corporation and Tai Cymru should give guidance to housing associations on the level of support that they should discuss with social services and health authorities. That would create a partnership, and the problem would not be solely the responsibility of social services as the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire would have it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Guidance is certainly required on the resolution of disputes. In Mold in my constituency, someone was allocated a property in a block of flats that he, his parents and I ultimately thought was unsuitable. Most of the tenants in that housing association block of flats were elderly, and the young man, who was in his early 20s, had just been resettled from a pyschiatric unit back into the community. He insisted on playing loud music day and night and that disturbed his neighbours. Therefore, the housing association took the young man to court to ask for a repossession order because no other dispute resolution procedure was available to arbitrate. Only the intervention of Shelter Cymru prevented that young man from being evicted from the property and being put back on the streets as no alternative accommodation was available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such cases, I would not want to criticise any of the parties involved. The health, safety and sanity of existing tenants is important as is that of the person being resettled. However, guidance from the Housing Corporation and Tai Cymru on what social landlords should do in a dispute would be helpful. The guidance could describe good practice and that would involve social services and health organisations as well as social landlords. Further guidance on how to evaluate and monitor the success of tenancies held by vulnerable people with previous histories of medical or social problems would also be welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0102">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>169</span>
The amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich would give the Housing Corporation and Tai Cymru the scope to consider this problem and to issue proper guidance that would assess and evaluate the support needed and would help to resolve matters. That would all be valuable. To say, as the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire said, that it is a social services problem ignores the fact that we are trying to create a partnership. People with special needs should certainly have the help of social services, but they should be able to live in the community in ordinary social housing, with neighbours who live ordinary lives. The two go together: they may have a social services input, but they are ordinary citizens, living ordinary lives in ordinary streets with ordinary neighbours. Disputes may arise, but some guidance needs to be given to social landlords to manage problems that they had not had to face before the advent of community care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be of assistance if I set out the Government's position. My intention is to invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment so that the Government may come back with their own. The hon. Gentleman's amendment refers to "vulnerable tenants" only; I should like to deal with a rather wider range of considerations. I accept what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire. It is not our intention to turn the Housing Corporation into a surrogate or replica of a social services department. However, as housing associations deal with vulnerable people—there are specialist housing associations—there comes a point at which it is sensible that accessible, common-sense advice should be available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not entirely clear whether it is intended that the corporation will issue individual guidance to social housing landlords in respect of different sorts of property. I concede that guidance could be different for property allocated to those who suffer from mental problems who are subject to care in the community and so on. Is it intended that the guidance should be variable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The intention is that the corporation should issue generally applicable guidance. However, it should not seek to duplicate the work of social services departments, which is well-established. The guidance should be relevant to the particular circumstances in which housing associations find themselves. That is why I wish to reconsider the matter, so that the amendment can be drawn in a way that embraces those matters that need to be embraced without trespassing onto territory that properly belongs to other organisations. On that basis and to assist other hon. Members who wish to speak on the matter I shall invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support the comments made by the hon. Member for Greenwich in moving the amendment. I welcome the constructive manner in which the Minister responded. Good management is the key to successful social housing, particularly in cases of special need. For that reason, it is important to get this part of the Bill right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>170</span>
However, I strongly disagree with the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire about separating housing and social services. It is incredibly difficult, particularly in cases of special need, to separate the various roles. I clearly remember the time when housing revenue accounts were ring-fenced. I remember the resulting problem of trying to pay for care, particularly for elderly people, who were used to such care; we did not know whether or not the money would come from housing benefit. If we do not get it right and if there is no co-ordination, it will be a disaster for people with special needs, who will be batted backwards and forwards between various bodies and departments. I have seen it happen before and I hope that the Minister will propose amendments that will avoid it happening again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hampstead and Highgate)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support amendment No. 109; indeed, I support everything that has been said by Opposition Members. There are two central issues. We spoke earlier of the desire not to create any sort of ghetto. That is why the Housing Corporation should be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other matter arises directly from a case in my constituency of a young woman who, for the first time in her life, is living outside an institution. For the first few weeks in her own accommodation, it did not occur to her that she had to switch off electric lights. She had always been used to life in an institution, where such things are someone else's responsibility. She first left her home when the bills began to arrive and a period of considerable difficulty followed. She simply wandered the streets, believing that no one could help her, and not knowing to whom she could go for help. I am blaming no one when I say that had there been genuine cooperation between the relevant bodies that are deemed responsible for dealing with the most vulnerable in society, that state of affairs could not have arisen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want Committee members to assume that references to vulnerable people denote exclusively mentally vulnerable people. People can be vulnerable for a range of reasons. Another of my constituency cases concerns a recovering drug and alcohol misuser, who has become the victim of people who are still misusing drugs and alcohol. They use her flat. They break in—they have broken the door down several times. She lives in a social housing environment where she is now having great difficulties with her neighbours, who are suddenly having to deal with what can only be called sub-criminal elements. If the Housing Corporation had such powers as my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich described, such problems would not arise. It is important—and this is the central point of my argument—not to progress towards the creation of ghettoes. As my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) said, we want people who are vulnerable, for any of a variety of causes, to be able to live ordinary lives, in ordinary streets, with ordinary neighbours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich has raised a very important issue and I support the comments that have been made on this subject by my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0103">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>171</span>
I was amazed by the comments of the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire. I do not know whether he made them out of naivet6 or a lack of interest in what is going on in his constituency. I cannot believe that anyone who has been a Member of Parliament in recent years could be unaware of the issues that we have been discussing and their effect on people's everyday lives; of the consistent management role played by housing associations and local authorities as landlords, in ensuring that vulnerable people are supported in the community; and of their central and important role in trying to resolve problems in that sphere. Their role is different from that of social services. As my hon. Friends have said, liaison between landlords and social services is essential. The different bodies should not do the same job—they should work together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that guidance to be issued by the Housing Corporation will include reference to the desirability of liaison between social services, the health authority and the landlord—a housing association, in the case that we have been considering—from the outset. When things go wrong it is often because of the breakdown of such liaison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends have already explained that when care in the community works well, it benefits enormously those people who have for many years been in institutional care—often wrongly. They emerge to lead a very different life. They have rights, certainly, but so do the neighbours alongside whom they go to live. Sometimes the achievement of a balance between those becomes very important. I am sorry that the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire has left the Room. Obviously, he no longer has any interest in the matter, and does not want to continue to take part in the debate, which I consider very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be trying not just to manage problems but to anticipate potential difficulties before property is even allocated. That should also be dealt with in the guidance. Some individuals might be better off in sheltered accommodation, needing more support. Others might not be suited to life in a flat, among other people, where noise and disturbance might affect them. Others might be much happier in a bungalow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could give examples of matters going badly wrong, even with liaison between housing and social services departments of the same local authority. It is sometimes an effort to ensure that people work alongside each other, even when they are part of the same organisation. However, an example of things going absolutely right is provided by the case of someone who was not just given any old property. A gentleman from my constituency had been in a mental hospital for the best part of his life. He came out and the first action of the housing managers in the area—they were from the local authority, but a parallel exists—was to explain to his neighbours, who were elderly people, what was happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The gentleman asked me to go to see him. When I knocked on the door, his neighbours immediately came out to say, "What is the matter? Can we help?", because they were starting to look after him and play a caring role in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He told me, "I have only one problem: I don't know to do my garden, because I have never had one before."
	<span class='label label-info column'>172</span>
The housing manager contacted a local voluntary group, which provided him with some tools—giving him a hobby, as well as enabling him to live better in his home and to enjoy it. That is housing management in its best sense: understanding the problems of the whole area and helping in a variety of ways. We should be encouraging housing managers—whether local authority managers or managers of housing association properties—to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many housing associations are fairly small, and do not have much back-up and specialist advice, so anything that the Housing Corporation can do to assist by offering appropriate guidance will be well received. My hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich has raised a valuable point, which I support. I am pleased that the Minister has recognised the principle, if not the wording, of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a good debate, in which several of my hon. Friends have made excellent speeches. The issue has been explained in an extraordinarily clear and forthright manner. The problem is serious; we cannot run away from it or sweep it under the carpet. We must ensure that the best provisions are in place to cope with the needs of people who require more than just bricks and mortar—who need not only a roof over their head but care and support. I am not talking solely about people suffering from mental illness; the elderly also need care as well as accommodation, and there are a variety of other needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The policy of special needs provision and community care will work only if all the agencies involved are coordinated and playing their appropriate role. We cannot, as the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire suggested, simply pass the matter to social services. Social services have an important role, but it must be integrated with that of housing providers. Each party must understand its respective role. If they do, we have a reasonable prospect of achieving the best possible framework for coping with what are real needs. This issue is vital, and my hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Christchurch have articulated in an extremely effective and moving way the importance of getting the policy right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I have been misunderstood. Let us envisage a house consisting of nine flats occupied by people who have been released into the community, one of whom is making life extremely difficult for the other eight. No matter what sort of relationship exists between social services and the social housing landlord, there comes a time when a decision must be taken. That decision is taken by the landlord on behalf of the other eight people. Such situations can and do arise, which is why it is so important to separate the two agencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman that there are circumstances in which the behaviour of an individual makes the life of the rest of the community intolerable and action must be taken. I differ from him about the view that that matter is for social services and not for housing managers. Housing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0104">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>173</span>
managers must be aware of what they are doing, what help is available, what is appropriate, how far it is possible to hope to keep someone in the community and at which point they must say that someone cannot be kept in the community. They must liaise with social services and health authorities in discharging those responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are seeking by the amendment to ensure that when the Housing Corporation gives guidance to social housing landlords as part of its general role of overseeing social housing provision, it does not ignore the crucial dimension of community care and the role of the landlord in that policy. We are not arguing that they should be the only people playing that role or that the question is one of providing accommodation in which large numbers of vulnerable and possibly disturbed people are dumped: quite the opposite. My hon. Friends the Members for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson) and for Delyn stressed the importance of having a framework that integrates people into the community without creating ghettos. If that is to happen, it is important that there is expert housing management by people who understand the implications of what they are doing. That is why we moved the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the Minister has accepted the thinking behind the amendment. I accept his point that we do not want to consider only those who might be classified as vulnerable, although we used that word in the amendment, and, in the spirit of his response, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"(f)complaints procedures for tenants".</p></blockquote>
This goes hand in hand with our discussions on the previous amendment. Earlier amendments may return, having been reworded, and may clarify some of the matters that we are discussing. The subject of management is an important part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that, at present, the Housing Corporation and many housing associations provide for tenants clearly outlined complaints procedures. I should like that provision to be included in the Bill. We hear much reassurance from Ministers about their intentions and about how the Bill will operate, but I want to ensure that the provision will be included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of earlier discussions and the fact that we are about to move on to other matters, I need say only that we are trying to create the best conditions for tenants. If you are trying to manage matters such as those that we have discussed this morning, it is important to have clear complaints procedures to assist in that management. In the area so graphically outlined by the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire, it is particularly important to have such procedures. I hope that the Housing Corporation will be able to gather together examples of best practice from around the country and ensure that new social landlords will have the best assistance when they begin to provide well-managed social housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
I hope that, in the spirit of the Minister's response to previous amendments and the spirit of the Committee, the amendment will be accepted. It is not contentious.

This brings clause 39 into line with the previous clause. Clause 38 deals with the issues on which the corporation may issue guidance, including repair of premises.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clauses 39 and 40 reveal the haste and the inadequate way in which the Bill was put together. They are a further example of poor drafting, which will have all sorts of damaging and unforeseen consequences if it is not fundamentally revised. The Government clearly accept that because they are tabling amendments to clause 40.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions in the clauses allow the Housing Corporation powers of entry to property when it believes that a social housing landlord may be failing to maintain or repair the property. However, they are so drafted that, under clause 40, if a person obstructs someone authorised by the Housing Corporation to enter a house, that person may be guilty of an offence. It does not take a legal genius to work out that a tenant could be guilty of an offence when he refuses to allow an official from the Housing Corporation into his property. The tenant may be entirely innocent, but he may not know who the official is or want him in his house. It is not the Government's intention to involve such tenants and they are tabling an amendment to cover that unhappy prospect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is the product of sloppy drafting and unclear thinking. The amendment would provide a far more satisfactory framework in which to achieve the same effect. We recognise that it is necessary, from time to time, for the Housing Corporation to have the ability to ensure that surveys are carried out if it is clear that a social housing landlord who has received public money has not used that money properly to maintain or repair dwellings. However, the Government have not taken the right approach. Instead, the corporation's power should be to require that a survey is undertaken and that the landlord is responsible for ensuring that that happens. The corporation would not have to enter the property to carry out the survey itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposal would be a more effective way of dealing with such problems. We recognise that the Housing Corporation must have the power to ensure that a survey is carried out should the landlord, for whatever reason, fail to do that. Therefore, under subsection (4) of the amendment, the corporation would be entitled to require that it receives the copy of a survey. If such a copy is not provided, the corporation would have the power, under subsection (5), to seek an injunction from a court to ensure that that requirement is met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposals would ensure that the corporation would have the powers to get the information that it needs, but without involving the cumbersome procedures that might have the unfortunate consequences that I outlined earlier. I know that the Minister will not accept the amendments, because he is tabling alternative amendments to clause 40. However, it is right that we should stress the reasons for our amendments and highlight the inadequacy of a Bill that
	<span class='label label-info column'>176</span>
the Committee must amend fundamentally if it is even to achieve the aims the Government have for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not surprising that I support the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Greenwich when one considers the intention of my amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to emphasise a couple of points. The hon. Member for Greenwich outlined the spirit of the amendments, and it is important to consider the inconvenience that tenants face when people request entry into their homes. I am reminded of the Home Energy Conservation Bill that I steered successfully on to the statute book last year. We discussed powers of entry into people's homes and it is vital that we consider the rights of tenants and that the notice of what will happen is made clear. They are clear in the amendment. Even if the Minister is not minded to accept the amendment or, indeed, to rewrite it, I hope that the spirit of what I have said will be incorporated into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments all seek to amend a clause, whose purpose is to ensure that if the corporation considers that a landlord is not maintaining stock adequately, it can act quickly and effectively to have premises surveyed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 110 could, I fear, lead to months of delay. It would be preferable for a landlord to carry out his own survey. The powers of entry are designed to come into force when landlords have failed to do so. It is a power of last resort to be used when a landlord has failed to do what should be done. I am more sympathetic to amendment No. 137, which would extend by three weeks the notice period given to the landlord. The measure appears to be relatively straightforward. It raises a number of questions about the procedure and I am willing to reflect on that. We need to consider, in particular, whether the notice for occupiers is sufficient and how a notice should be given. The consideration could also embrace the issues raised in amendment No. 138, although the requirements that it would impose appear to be burdensome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 139 would require the written authorisation held by the surveyor to be given under the seal of the corporation, but the authorisation will be an official document and is likely to be recognisable as such without the need for the corporation's seal. I invite the Committee not to accept amendments Nos. 110, 138 and 139, but I am content to consider amendment No. 137 and, perhaps, bring forward an alternative which, while extending the notice period to 28 days, would also improve the provisions for notifying tenants that a survey is to take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 128, 129 and 130 would amend the clause by removing the provisions for creating an offence of obstruction and for fining a person found guilty of obstruction.

Amendment No. 144, therefore, makes it clear that the provisions are directed only at the landlord, his officers or his employees. We must ensure that the surveyor can carry out his functions without hindrance from landlords. We must retain the provisions on offences and fines, but limit their application more tightly.

	<br><blockquote><p>That consideration of clauses 41 to 48 be postponed.</p></blockquote>
I shall explain the purpose of the motion. Before the Opposition collapse into a fit of giggles, I must point out that they have not tabled any amendments to the clauses that present difficulty. We all wish to ensure that the problem, which has arisen relatively recently, can be dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to emphasise the purpose of the clauses. We must protect public funds and we need to protect tenants if a landlord goes bust. If that happened without there being such a mechanism in place, the properties could be sold into the private sector. The rents could rise and tenants could lose their guarantees. The housing benefit bill would rise and those tenants not on benefit could be in serious difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We envisaged that, before anyone could enforce security or the landlords decide that they should give notice to the Housing Corporation, the corporation would sell to another social landlord and that money would pay off the debts and liabilities. We identified a problem that could arise. It is hypothetical, but a provision must be in place to deal with it. That problem is covered in seven or eight clauses, the essential clause being clause 46.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key issue is what happens to debt and liabilities. Lenders fear that amounts going into the transfer would not pay off their interest as creditors. They understand what we are trying to achieve. In a letter dated 12 February, Mr. Adrian Coles said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The CML understands that behind these provisions is a recognition of the need to protect tenants' interests should a registered social landlord become insolvent. Lenders appreciate that tenants' rights should be considered. However, in doing so these provisions have fettered the lender's fundamental right to enforce its security. This represents a significant shift of priorities in a market where private finance stands at around £10bn."</p></blockquote>
I quoted the whole paragraph, so the Committee cannot accuse me of selecting parts of it. The heart of the argument is how to reconcile the lender's concerns with the need to protect the tenant and protect public money, too, as that is engaged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister assured us that he quoted the whole paragraph. The convention is that if a Minister quotes from a document he should make it available to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have the slightest difficulty in making the document available to the Committee and shall ensure that it is. In fact, I would be astonished if it were not already available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need provision to cover that contingency. I do not believe that we can return to the 1988 Act—in other words, not cover the matter at all. There are two reasons why: first, the grant rates were higher then so there is now proportionately much more private finance engaged in the market than there was almost 10 years ago. Secondly, 10 years ago there were far fewer mainstream lenders specialising in this market. There
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0107">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>179</span>
are now far more lenders and a much more diverse range of supplies in the market. There is a great deal more risk in the sector as well. We must find a balance—a way of protecting the tenants and the taxpayers. The obvious way to do that is to sit around a table and discuss it. We have been discussing matters with representatives of lenders since the end of January. The problem has not been brought to us suddenly. However, a letter was circulated by Allen and Overy firing some warning signals. I am happy for that to be made available. It was that which, if I may say so, set the fiery cross racing through the financial community, and that which erupted, if I may use that word, in the past week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning I talked to Mr. Adrian Coles about the matter that I have been discussing. I had intended to invite the Committee to proceed to deliberate on the clauses, which we should subsequently amend on Report. I have reflected on that proposal, and two considerations have appeared relevant: first, that it would be better to present clauses that would have the effect that we intend; and secondly, that the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish, who chairs the Environment Select Committee, wants the Committee to be able to examine the amendments. I propose immediately to continue the meetings that have begun, in an attempt to find a way of reconciling the entirely legitimate concerns of the lenders with the legitimate interests of the tenants and our natural concern that public money should be protected. I intend to table new clauses before the Committee finishes its sittings. That is why I proposed earlier that the amendments should be moved towards the end of the sittings. I hope that you, Mr. Me William, and members of the Committee will find that an acceptable way of tackling a problem that came on everyone rather rapidly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No member of the Committee and no member of the public who has been following our proceedings today should be unaware of the significance of what we have just heard. We have heard a Minister make a humiliating admission that the Government have entirely failed to include in a Bill practical and realistic measures for achieving ends that we all accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one challenges the need to give the Housing Corporation effective regulatory powers to ensure that an association with serious financial problems could be dealt with expeditiously and to protect tenants', lenders' and the public interest. Eight clauses relevant to that task have been written in such a way as to frighten the country's lending institutions—to the point of jeopardising the entire future funding of the housing association programme. That is why the Minister has
	<span class='label label-info column'>180</span>
had to make a humiliating climbdown. If he had not, issues for funding of housing associations would have come to a halt. There is no question about that. That view did not originate with me. It is not Opposition scaremongering. A very clear statement has been made by the Housing Finance Corporation, the body that has probably done most to secure new funds, raised in the capital markets, for housing associations. I received a letter yesterday from Barbara Ainger—not Barry Ainger, as 	<i>The Guardian</i> unfortunately managed to style her yesterday—the chief executive of the Housing Finance Corporation. It begins:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Further to my letter of Monday 12 February I am writing to let you know that our worst fears have been realised and the institutional investor market has now taken fright at the impact of the Housing Bill (Sections 23 and 41–48 particularly".</p></blockquote>
I remind the Committee that clause 23 was withdrawn by the Minister earlier in the Committee proceedings, and that we are now considering the withdrawal of clauses 41 to 48. The letter continues by explaining that the market has taken fright
	<br><blockquote><p>"to the extent that there has been heavy selling of housing association debenture stock paper. This has immediately led to increased margins on existing stocks but, even more dramatically, has effectively closed the market to new housing association issuance for the foreseeable future. I am very much afraid that even if the offending Clauses are totally withdrawn the 'political risk'" arguments will remain around for some time and we will probably not be able to contemplate a new issue for several months."</p></blockquote>
What a comment on the incompetence of Government; by maladroit drafting and by failing to consider properly the consequences of their actions, they have jeopardised the whole social housing programme, and we are not talking about only one part of the social housing programme. It was the Government's decision that housing associations should be the prime bodies for delivering social housing. They stopped local authorities developing it on the grounds that it should be done by housing associations. Now, through their own incompetence, they have put a question mark over the ability of the housing association movement to fulfil that role. That is the significance of what we are debating now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the problem was unforeseen, that it came about only in the past few days. The truth is that the matter has been under consideration for many months. During consultation with lenders last year, the Government proposed to apply certain arrangements. As a result of representations made by the lenders, those proposals were withdrawn. I have heard from several sources in the past 24 hours that only when the Bill emerged did lenders become aware of the precise significance of what the Government intended—and I am not talking about the Bill, which was published less than a month ago. Only when those implications were fully analysed did it become clear that the Government's proposals went to the heart of the basis on which housing association schemes are financed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past 24 hours we have received a great deal of advice from bodies involved in raising finance for housing associations or in advising them on their
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0108">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>181</span>
activities. A letter from Berwin Leighton put the matter most succinctly. The letter was sent to me by fax yesterday. It states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Bill approaches the matter in a way which does not take account of the basis upon which finance for Housing Associations is normally provided.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>There is not, in the real world, a free market for sales of occupied social housing. For that reason, banks do not normally advance funds on the basis of a capital value of the properties offered as security. Rather, they lend as much money as they believe will be capable of being paid off out of the net rental from the particular property. The distinction between lending against a property for its realisable value and lending against the future income stream is very important."</p></blockquote>
How right that is. The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The effect of the Bill, if enacted in its present form, would be fundamentally to change the basis on which banks are able to provide finance for Housing Associations. Instead of being able to value property offered as security by reference to the rental stream from the properties offered as security, the banks will only be able to lend the amount which they are satisfied would be capable of being repaid out of net proceeds of a sale at a price to be assessed at some time in the future by a District Valuer over whom they have little realistic control or influence. In the absence of a real market there must be great uncertainty about how the value would be assessed.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>What that means is that banks providing finance for Housing Associations would need to insist on a much wider margin of security. That is, to take security over a greater amount of property to secure any given loan. Because of the uncertainty, the cost of monies to Associations would also be likely to go up."</p></blockquote>
I shall skip part of the letter because it is quite long, but Berwin Leighton, also says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have been told of a number of banks expressing concern. I am able to say that in a particular transaction in which we are involved, an indication has already been given by the bank concerned that they are likely not to proceed in the light of the legislation."</p></blockquote>
There it is. The whole issue is encapsulated in that letter from Berwin Leighton. We have had letters from many other large firms, such as Clifford Chance, and bodies involved in raising finance for housing associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crucial issue is that the drafting of clauses 41 to 48 would allow the Housing Corporation to appoint a manager to take over the affairs of an association in difficulty. That manager would be able to sell the properties on the valuation of the district valuer, which would not necessarily give the lenders the return that they would expect. The capital value might have fallen, although the rental stream would still exist, as has happened in the past few years. The Government's mishandling of the housing market has resulted in capital values falling. Lenders who invested in housing associations some years ago and who had depended on the capital value will be very worried. They have depended on the rental stream, so they have been covered. That principle will be eroded by the proposals in clauses 41 to 48.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lenders would be vulnerable because the manager would be able to dispose of properties according to the valuation agreed by the district valuer, and that would leave them with insufficient money to provide the return that they expected. Even if they took the return and invested it in gilts, it would not be guaranteed to be sufficient. That is why they are nervous and worried. It is their money and they are rightly concerned about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is not it extraordinary that the Government should get into that position after having consulted last year the
	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
people who are involved? Having heard of the anxieties about their proposals, they publish the proposals in the Bill without properly testing them out with the lenders, housing associations and other parties involved. That is incompetence on a grand scale and the Government should be deeply ashamed of the damage they have done to the housing association movement and the prospects of people who are in need of housing association homes. Their entire legislative programme is in disrepute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far, 11 clauses out of 48 that we have considered to date have been withdrawn. Almost 25 per cent, of the clauses have been withdrawn within a month of the Bill being published. That is an extraordinary comment on the Government's failure to manage their affairs properly and to look after the interests for which they are responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept what the Minister proposed because it is right and proper that a message should go out from the Committee today that the Government have made a fundamental mistake and must reconsider the matter. For confidence in the market, there must be a clear message that the issue will be reconsidered. Therefore, we accept the Government's offer to withdraw the clauses for further consideration. We also accept that there must be major amendments to the clauses to ensure that the mechanism that is eventually agreed provides the safeguards, which we all accept are necessary, to protect the public interest and that of tenants, and to protect lenders, who want the Housing Corporation to have effective powers to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I emphasise the point that the hon. Gentleman has made. We will try to strike a balance. We have agreed in the Committee that the three interests that must be balanced include that of tenants. I am not in the slightest bit ashamed about wanting to protect the interest of tenants. That was at the forefront of my mind. I am intrigued by the hon. Gentleman's espousal of the concerns of the City, but I am as concerned as he is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New Labour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The drift to the right is becoming absolutely remarkable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second interest that we must balance is that of the public and the third is that of the lenders. There is no simple formula for doing that. I take the hon. Gentleman on trust, because I know that he is a man of integrity, but we must strike that balance. There is no point in my returning with amendments and then being attacked for disregarding the tenants or the public funds. We will balance those interests as effectively as possible and I trust that the Committee will respect that that must be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the principles of Standing Orders is that we do not have two bites at cherries in separate debates. We are in danger of doing that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We were not arguing that any one of those interests should be given priority. We accept the natural and legitimate interests of the lenders. We accept the interests of the tenants. We accept the interests of the public purse. Our argument is not about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0109">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>183</span>
that—it is about the way in which the Government have handled the matter and put in the Bill measures that clearly will not work and do not have the confidence of one of those groups. That is the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will say repeatedly that there has been maladroit handling of a major matter which has caused chaos in the funding markets for housing associations and which has jeopardised the funding of housing associations and, therefore, of the housing association programme. There has been incompetence on a grand scale and we want it put right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will be looking for full consultation during the next few weeks with all the interested parties to ensure that safeguards and the proper mechanisms for control are in place and that the reality on which the housing association movement is funded is recognised. The Minister appeared surprised that we spoke up for the interests of the City, but we spoke up out of understanding of how the housing association programme is financed. We know what is necessary to make it work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The extraordinary thing is that the Government, who have been in power for 17 years, do not seem to be aware of how the housing association movement is funded and what is necessary to ensure that it can raise the money. We want full consultation with all the interested parties, and proposals to be brought back to the Committee so that they can be properly debated and, I hope, achieve the objectives which we all agree are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are pleased that the Government have agreed to bring the matter back to the Committee rather than move amendments on Report, because, as the Minister knows only too well, there simply is not the opportunity on Report to give full consideration to matters of such detail. It is right and proper that there should be full consideration in Committee when the revised clauses 41 to 48 come back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the Government's belated decision to do the right thing. We deplore the chaos, confusion, uncertainty and damage that they have caused in the process and will look very carefully at the proposals to ensure that there is a proper regulatory framework which allows the housing association movement and social housing in general to flourish and to be able to raise finance, and to ensure that, when things go wrong, there are proper safeguards in place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Christchurch, I remind the Committee that the Question before us is whether we should postpone clauses 41 to 48 to the end of our consideration of the Bill.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will do my best, Mr. McWilliam. We have no option but to accept what the Minister has put before us. If he is at all responsible, he has no option but to take the course of action that he has.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it incredible that, even before the Bill has reached the statute book, it is having effects outside the
	<span class='label label-info column'>184</span>
House. Many of us have received letters about that. I received one from Warner Cranston, a firm of solicitors. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Indeed, the mere publication of these provisions has, we hope temporarily, closed at least one source of private finance (the rated bond market) to housing associations."</p></blockquote>
In view of that, and the fact that in the past couple of years the sum of money from the Government for social housing has been cut—it has been virtually halved—the situation is extremely serious. The Minister not only has to come back with proposals to deal with the problem that has been highlighted, but must produce proposals to deal with the problems that have been inadvertently created before the Bill has even reached the statute book. There will have to be careful drafting so that people who want to give and lend money in the social housing sector are absolutely confident. We have heard this morning how difficult that matter is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked about consultation—we know that there was consultation last year—and said, "The problem is not new; we knew about it a fortnight ago." It is incredible that when drafting a major Housing Bill—the first for ages—the problem did not come to light, if the Government properly consulted interested parties: the Housing Corporation, housing associations and lenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister tell us this morning—or at least write to tell us—exactly what consultation took place, and how he intends to ensure that we end up with better provision in the new clauses that he will draft? It is amazing that in the second week of consideration of the Bill in Committee, clauses have been withdrawn and amended because of bad wording or things not having been taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel most strongly about the fact that consultation papers have been published only when the Bill is in Committee. It is highly likely that the responses to some of the consultation papers will not be received in time to be discussed in Committee—although, if the Committee lasts longer because there are new clauses to consider, perhaps we shall have a chance to discuss those responses. I look forward to hearing from the Minister how he intends to deal with that problem. I hope that the Minister will tell us in some detail why the consultation went so wrong and what he proposes to do to put it right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In my constituency, there is a vast amount of Ministry of Defence housing. In due course, a consortium of housing associations will run that housing. The raising of finance is at a pivotal stage. If what the solicitors who have corresponded with me say

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a brief comment in support of my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich, who fully explained the concerns of Opposition Members, and the hon. Member for Christchurch. In a letter that I received this morning from Warner Cranston solicitors, I read with interest and surprise the allegation—which I cannot possibly believe—that clauses 41 to 48 were drafted without any prior consultation with housing associations or other interested parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would welcome the Minister telling me today that it is not true that clauses 41 to 48 were published after the Government had been told in consultation last year that the system would not work. I have every reason to believe Warner Cranston, but I am sure that the Minister will want to take the opportunity this morning to deny that no consultation took place on the clauses, which were drafted after the principle that they embody had received a heavy mauling last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister does not do that, he will be guilty of culpable lack of foresight. I support the hon. Member for Christchurch—I would like to receive from the Minister during the next week a letter outlining in detail what consultations will take place, who will be consulted, when the consultation period will end, whether my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich, and the hon. Member for Christchurch on behalf of the Liberal Democrats, will be consulted on how new clauses will be tabled, and when the Committee will have sight of those new clauses prior to their consideration. Such matters are important and if the concerns that have been expressed today are true, I have no hesitation in supporting my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich. Something has gone drastically wrong. Will the Minister say what consultation has taken place? How does he intend to remedy the problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Greenwich was predictably apocalyptic. On such occasions, I fall back on the frequently repeated aphorism of Lord Slim during the war that no news is ever as good or bad as it first appears. The hon. Gentleman had an open goal in front of him and he took advantage of it. It is right that he should have his day, but there were moments when I reflected on Mr. Churchill's observation about Horatio Bottomley in that he was in danger in generating too much indignation for his own health.

Opposition Members have referred to the Housing Corporation consultation paper. I shall re-read what the hon. Members for Greenwich and for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) said on Second Reading, but I do
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
not recall the matter taking up much of their speeches. That suggests that my constituents in the City of London were more vigilant in their scrutiny of the Bill than the official Opposition. I do not want that remark to be interpreted as complacency. I welcome the Government's reaction; it is a matter of pride that our system in Parliament is sufficiently flexible that, despite our notable pace on the Bill, my constituents were able to flood us with correspondence before we reached this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman said that his constituents in the City of London were able to comment on the Bill. Given the seriousness of the clauses, surely they would have been able to do that before the Bill had reached this stage. This situation could have then been avoided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hasten to say that I include in my remarks about my constituents the Council of Mortgage Lenders in the Westminster end of my constituency. I take the hon. Gentleman's point; I am not complacent. I look forward to the new clauses. I have every confidence that my constituents will, on the next occasion as on this occasion, be even more vigilant than the Opposition in their scrutiny of the provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I close my remarks on the basis that it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good. I mean my next remarks to be entirely kindly: one firm of solicitors, who are not my constituents, that has been quoted in the Committee added to my sense of legal ironies by revealing that its address is in Clink street. I place absolutely on all fours with that great Sligo firm, Argue and Fibs, which I am sorry to say has gone out of business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before I call other members of the Committee to speak, I presume that everyone has those solicitors' letters. I have not seen them because, having to be neutral, my secretary has instructions not to give me any correspondence from any outside bodies lobbying on the Bill. I hope that hon. Members do not read them out. I shall read them after we have finished our proceedings, when I have no more responsibility for the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support strongly everything that was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich. Having had the privilege to serve on other Committees that have discussed major Bills during the comparatively short time that I have been an hon. Member, I am not astonished and bemused that the Government allowed such a lamentable lapse to occur. Moreover, my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) has reassured me that it has been her experience over the past 16 years that the Government's approach to the drafting of Bill is somewhat louche and, in many instances, fails markedly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In common with other members of the Committee, I have received communications from firms of solicitors. They were all from solicitors who work for housing associations. In essence, their concern is about the reduction of private sector funding as a result of badly drafted clauses, which were not thought out. Evidence
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0111">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>187</span>
has already been presented from Berwin Leighton and Warner Cranston. I have received a letter from Clifford Chance that states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is the Government's policy and intention to ensure Housing Associations raise an increasing proportion of the funds they require for their social housing activities from private sector banks and from the capital markets. The level of private secured finance presently made available to Housing Associations is approximately £6 billion and the sector will probably require a further £3-4 billion over the next three years."</p></blockquote>
The Government, who argue that funding for housing associations must increasingly be raised from private sector banks, have drafted provisions that have caused those very funding sources to withdraw and forceclose—let us hope temporarily—on negotiations that are already under way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of the letter from Warner Cranston that my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn referred to, it beggers belief that clauses 41 to 48 were published without any prior consultation with housing associations. The letter also says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Last year, the Housing Corporation initiated a consultation exercise in relation to a proposal to extend the administration order regime of the Insolvency Act 1986"—</p></blockquote>
which I presume is the Act on which clauses 41 to 48 are based—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to housing associations that are incorporated as industrial and provident societies. That proposal was withdrawn in response to the widespread opposition it provoked among housing associations and lenders alike."</p></blockquote>
Berwin Leighton's letter reiterates that the Government's case is based, as far as they understand it—and Berwin Leighton is very experienced in these matters—on an entirely theoretical situation in which the Housing Corporation would have to pass the management of one housing association that had become bankrupt over to another housing association.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Report stage does not take place in Committee. I shall be bringing the new clauses back to the Committee for consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are having a problem: members of the Committee are beginning to debate the substance of clauses when the motion is that those clauses are withdrawn, redrafted and resubmitted at the end of the Committee. That places me in some difficulty: as I said earlier, members of the Committee cannot take two separate bites at the same cherry, as they are attempting to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. I am grateful for the Minister's response. If we have his categorical assurance that clauses 41 to 48 will be withdrawn today, that they will be redrafted only after consultation with those who are the most intimately involved in this matter and that members of the Committee will have adequate time to debate the new proposals, that will be a step in the right direction. However, I urge the Minister to pubicise such a course of action as speedily and broadly as he can in the hope that the negotiations under way between private financiers and housing associations will not be put on permanent hold or simply disappear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Let me say something before I call another member of the Committee, because the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate has just fallen into the trap. The question before us does not remove the clauses from the Bill: it puts their consideration to the end of the Bill to enable amendments to be drafted to them. When members of the Committee are debating the question, will they please bear in mind the fact that that is exactly what is before the Committee, and nothing else? The substance of those clauses is a matter for later debate against the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I am not clear whether you are the person I should be asking for clarification. When I asked the Minister for an assurance that clauses 41 to 48 would be withdrawn, he nodded in acquiescence. I understood that to mean that he agreed with me, but you, Mr. McWilliam, now tell me that that is not the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may nod and acquiesce to anything, but I am telling the Committee what has been moved and what happens under Standing Orders.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Timms 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. McWilliam, for that clarification. You have reignited our anxieties about what may happen. It is clear that the current financing of housing association projects has been put in jeopardy—in some cases, finance has even been withdrawn—because of the publication of these clauses. We have been told that the rated bond market is no longer accessible to housing associations. If we proceed as the Minister proposes and if the clauses are left hanging until the end of March when they will be considered with some amendments, uncertainty will remain for the rest of this month and for the whole of next month. Great damage will be done to the work of housing associations unless the Minister can give clear assurances that will restore confidence in financing sources and allow the projects to go ahead. It would be better to proceed in the way that the Minister appeared to indicate to my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate and for the clauses to be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The motion I invited you, Mr. McWilliam, to put to the Committee was that consideration of clauses 41 to 48 be postponed until we reach the end of the Bill. That means that we shall bring those clauses, and amendments to them, back when we reach the end of the Bill. In the meantime, we shall engage in consultations with all interested parties. Those consultations have already begun and I hope that they will result in all the interested parties subscribing to the amendments that will make the clauses acceptable across the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that clarification. Will the Minister tell us whether that will be sufficient to reopen the sources of finance to housing associations that appear to have been closed as a result of the publication of the clauses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that people in the market will have heard what has been said in Committee this morning. They will have understood that everyone in the Committee wants the clauses to meet the concerns and legitimate interests of the three groups we have mentioned. All of us wish to see private finance flowing into the housing association movement. The spirit behind the consultation is to achieve that balance. I hope that those groups will accept the Government's and the Committee's commitment to ensuring that funding continues to be provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that assurance.

Clause 61 provides a table showing provisions defining or otherwise explaining the expressions used in part I. Clause 105 provides definitions of members of a person's family. It restates section 113 of the Housing Act 1985 for the purpose of introductory tenancies. New clause 6 restates section 105 of the Housing Associations Act 1985, with amendments to reflect current family law, to be used in relation to paragraph 1 to schedule 1 to part I of the Bill—control of payments to members—covering registered social landlords.

Amendment No. 235 adds the term "member of family" to the list of expressions in clause 61. The term is defined in new clause 6 to reflect the use of the expression in paragraph 1 to schedule 1.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause would provide an explicit right of appeal by an agreed social landlord against a decision by the Housing Corporation in the discharge of its regulatory function. There is no explicit right of appeal under existing legislation for housing associations. Although, in theory, associations can appeal to the High Court using the traditional review procedure, none has ever done so. In the interests of justice, there should be a simple, straightforward right of appeal and that is why we drafted the new clause. I hope that, in the interests of speed, the Minster can accept it as quickly as I have moved it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was about to say, "in the spirit of amicability", but he remembered his previous remarks and had the decency to correct himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the actions of the corporation should be subject to appeal. Rights of appeal to the High Court appear in certain parts of the Bill, but most of the corporation's actions and decisions are subject to appeal through a process of judicial review. That is an important distinction because, under judicial review, a decision that the court had quashed would have to be retaken by the corporation, taking into account the court's ruling. The corporation would then be under a duty to consult interested parties and would need to retake the decision, having regard to all the relevant considerations, which may go wider than the causes of the party that brought the action. If the action were quashed under an appeal to the High Court, the court would simply substitute its decision for that of the corporation. The corporation would have no further responsibility in the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I understand the spirit of the new clauses, I believe that they constitute a less attractive form of appeal than the one already in place and I am not persuaded that they should be incorporated into the Bill.

This is the last new clause that I shall address today and, as we have little time, I will be extremely brief. The purpose of the new clause is to remove an arbitrary limit on the maximum number of properties that can be included in the holding of any new social landlord taking over properties from a local authority. The figure
	<span class='label label-info column'>194</span>
of 8,000 is included under current provisions put forward by the Government for no apparent reason. I do not know the basis for that figure or what justifies it. It cannot be said that that figure has operated in the past because Broomleigh housing association took over the stock of the London borough of Bromley, which constituted approximately 12,000 properties. An arbitrary figure of 8,000 denies flexibility and there is no known justification for it. I hope that the Minister will accept the new clause to ensure a more flexible framework for the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I cannot accept the new clause. The size limit is important to bring more diversity and choice into the sector. Housing associations need to be responsive to their tenants and imposing an upper limit helps to achieve diversity as it means that we do not create monopolistic organisations. I am unable to accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's reply is entirely unconvincing—if that was the case, why did the Government accept the Broomleigh transfer of 12,000 properties? As we are approaching the end of the sitting, and so that we can concentrate our attention on houses in multiple occupation when we resume next week, I beg to ask leave to withdraaw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
