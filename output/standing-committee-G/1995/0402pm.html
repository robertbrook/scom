<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>New clause 85—<i>Order for possession (No. 1)</i>—
<br><blockquote><p>"[] In section 85 of the Housing Act 1985 after subsection (4) there shall be inserted:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>'(4A) Where an order for possession is suspended on conditions in accordance with subsections (2) and (3) and the tenant defaults in or fails to perform the relevant conditions:

<li>the secure tenancy shall not be determined until actual pos session is recovered by the landlord.</li></ol></p></blockquote>

<br><blockquote><p>"[] In section 9 of the Housing Act 1988 after subsection (4) there shall be inserted:</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1014</span>
<br><blockquote><p>'(4A) Where an order for possession is suspended on conditions in accordance with subsections (2) and (3) and the tenant defaults in or fails to perform the relevant conditions or any of them:
<ol>
<li>the order shall not be enforced without leave of the court; and</li>
<li>the assured tenancy shall not be determined until actual possession is recovered by the landlord.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(4B) Where an order for possession is stayed or the date of possession is postponed in accordance with subsection (2), the assured tenancy shall not determine until actual possession is recovered by the landlord.'.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Diana Maddock <span class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of what you have said, Mr. McWilliam, I shall proceed with great speed. Just to recap for members of the Committee, new clauses 85 and 86, to which I was speaking just before lunch, do much the same thing, but deal with different types of tenancy.<br><br>
New clause 85 seeks to ensure that social landlords who have obtained a suspension order do not enforce that order by means of a warrant for possession without first obtaining the court's leave. That would reverse the decision in the 1987 case of Thompson <i>v.</i> Elmbridge borough council, where it was held that if there was a breach of the terms of a suspended possession order, the secure tenancy would end immediately. What I shall say about these two new clauses also applies to some amendments that I will move later, so that will also speed up our proceedings this afternoon.<br><br>
Like other members of the Committee, I am not a lawyer and am reliant on legal advice on this matter. I am advised that the procedure in a possession action that relates to secure and assured tenancies is as follows. When a court makes an order for possession against an assured or a secure tenant, the tenancy ends when the tenant is due to give up possession under the order, and not when the tenant is evicted. That was confirmed in the case to which I referred earlier. I believe that the same problems could arise under the Bill's new introductory tenancies.<br><br>
The two most frequent types of order are, first, possession in 28 days—often called a final order—where the tenancy ends upon the expiry of the 28 days and not when the tenant is evicted. That is normally some months later and often it is not acted on at all. The second is where possession in 28 days is suspended, which might happen because the current rent falls due and although it has been agreed that the tenant will pay off so many pounds a week, he has not done that; or it might be that the condition is that he does not cause a nuisance. The tenancy will not end while the condition of the suspension is kept, but should the tenant be even one day later in payment—which could be because of a delay in receiving housing benefit or illness—the tenancy ends immediately, providing the 28 days have passed. The landlord can then issue a warrant to evict. That leads to various problems.<br><br>
Such circumstances can last for several years, and it is not infrequent for landlords to issue a warrant five, seven or even 11 years after the order. The problem is that in the meantime, the tenant is not technically a tenant—he is a trespasser. If the landlord does not make repairs, the former tenant cannot obtain an injunction for breach of repair covenant or damages. If it is a former social tenancy, he cannot exercise the right to repair. Moreover, if the former tenant dies, it is difficult for the widow to succeed to the tenancy.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0573">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1015</span>
When we debated amendment No. 349 to clause 122, I asked the Minister whether the council could give a tenancy to the widow under the allocation of housing provisions in the Bill. On 12 March he responded:
<br><blockquote><p>"As long as the person remains a tenant"—</p></blockquote>
the qualifier in his statement—
<br><blockquote><p>"whatever has happened in the meantime, he or she will be covered by the amendment."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee G,</i> 12 March 1996; c. 603.]</p></blockquote>
There could be problems as current provisions are unsatisfactory. New clause 85 resolves the problem for secure tenants and new clause 86 does so for assured tenants. Another problem is that if people are not technically tenants, they cannot exercise their right to buy. The Minister should be mindful of that problem too.<br><br>
I have tabled other amendments, which we shall consider later, that also help to resolve the problem. If the Minister does not accept that my amendments are properly drafted, he should give commitment to table his own properly drafted amendments. New clauses 85 and 86 deal with the problem that a landlord can issue a warrant to evict simply on an administrative act—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Lady, but hon. Members are indicating that it is more comfortable without jackets. It is in order to remove them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. I shall keep my jacket on.<br><br>
In the High Court people cannot be evicted by an administrative act. Leave of the court is required. In the Thompson case, the Court of Appeal commented on the disparity between county court and High Court practice. Even five and a half years after a county court order, the landlord can evict. Not until six years have elapsed is the leave of court required first.<br><br>
The new clauses would solve the problem by creating a standard procedure to ensure that a warrant to evict was not issued to enforce a suspended possession order without the court's having had an opportunity to reconsider the case. The Minister should accept my new clauses or, failing that, persuade the Lord Chancellor to resolve the problem by changing the rules of court.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. James Clappison)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: New clause 63 reflects the hon. Lady's concern for people with mental health problems. I draw her attention to county court rules, which prevent a landlord or lender from serving a notice for possession on a person with a mental disorder within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1983. The notice must be served on someone who is authorised to handle the person's affairs, or the person he lives with or the person responsible for his care. He will have to be represented in court by a guardian or court appointee. That will ensure that someone who is responsible for that person is involved in the possession procedure.<br><br>
In addition, before bailiffs evict occupants from a property, they must make a prior visit to the property to ensure that the occupants are aware of the date of eviction. As a matter of practice, they notify the local authority's social services department if anyone at the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1016</span>
property is likely to need support at the time of the eviction.<br><br>
I therefore believe that new clause 63 is unnecessary. We have already agreed, in discussing new clause 19, to see whether guidance to local authorities should be supplemented on that point. We will also consider whether guidance to housing associations is adequate.<br><br>
I heard what the hon. Lady said about new clauses 85 and 86, but I shall not go into the details of the legal cases to which she referred. I will consider them, but I am not in broad agreement with her argument. She would create an extra and unnecessary procedural step. The new clauses deal with the situation when a possession order has been suspended. The hon. Lady will be aware that in cases of rent arrears, if payments are kept up, the possession order is never executed. If not, the landlord may apply in writing to the court for the bailiffs to take possession of the property. The extra procedural step proposed by the hon. Lady is unnecessary and will merely prolong the process of eviction.<br><br>
The hon. Lady referred to later amendments. In amendment No. 550, the tenant will already have had an opportunity to make his case in court and should be aware of the serious position in which he has put himself and his home, before the court chooses to make a suspended possession order.<br><br>
The hon. Lady drew attention to cases where the tenant may have made a slip or may be one day late; we know from the report "Rent Arrears in Local Authorities and Housing Associations in England (1994)" that almost without exception social landlords in arrears cases ask for suspended possession and, where agreements for payment are ratified in the courts, monitor those cases carefully for default. Landlords consider using the final deterrent of eviction only where arrangements break down irretrievably.<br><br>
New clause 86 would also apply to private landlords because it involves assured tenancies, but it is unnecessary and would be another imposition on landlords, requiring them to seek another court hearing. So although I will look at the cases to which the hon. Lady referred, the new clause is a step too many; the suspended order has already been made at a court hearing and we should regard that as an important step.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point I was making on new clause 63 was that, despite what the Under-Secretary says, people sometimes slip through the net and I wanted to highlight such cases with the aim of persuading the Under-Secretary to do a little more. He clearly believes that matters are satisfactory; I disagree with him but because of the need to make progress I shall not press new clause 63.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary talked about extra procedure on new clauses 85 and 86. My amendments seek security of tenure for people who can end up not having the same rights as other tenants because they do not have a secure tenancy even though they have not been and are not likely to be evicted—possession orders are hung over people to make them obey the rules. As the Bill is worded, those people would be vulnerable and unable to get repairs done, for example.<br><br>
I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for saying that he will look carefully at the legal aspects. A case has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0574">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1017</span>
been made for tidying them up; if the legal procedure were made simpler, it would save much court time in cases where people challenged the lack of repairs and so on.<br><br>
I thank the Under-Secretary for his comments. I am slightly disappointed about his response to new clause 63 and I hope that he will look seriously at new clauses 85 and 86.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Lady indicate her intention?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had done that by saying that I would not press clause 63.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady must withdraw it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. McWilliam. It is a case of more haste, less speed. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</span></p>

New Clause 83</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
LANDLORD'S COVENANT TO KEEP DWELLING HEALTHY</div> <!-- title -->
<p>'.—In subsection 1 of section 11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (repairing obligations in short leases), after paragraph (c), insert:—
<br><blockquote><p>"(d) to keep the premises from becoming prejudicial to health by reason of a defect of a structural character.".'.[<i>Mrs. Maddock.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
The new clause deals with the landlord's covenant to keep a dwelling healthy. The amendment is designed to prevent dwellings becoming prejudicial to health. At present there are many cases of tenants being unable to deal with unsatisfactory conditions wholly under repairing covenants or through an action for nuisance and where they cannot wholly achieve a remedy under the statutory nuisance provisions. Nuisance and breach of contract are dealt with in ordinary civil courts and statutory nuisance is dealt with in magistrates courts. That has resulted in much wasteful duplication of proceedings. Like the previous amendment I moved, the amendment enables the tenant to achieve satisfactory living conditions and appropriate compensation by taking a single action in the civil courts. I hope that the Minister will at least consider the amendment and consult lawyers about it, even if he will not accept it today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Lady. No one would argue with the basic principle that landlords should provide accommodation that is fit to live in. That is why in 1989 my Department invited the Law Commission to consider the law on responsibility for the state and condition of property. The commission published its report two weeks ago, and the amendment is clearly based on its recommendations—as is amendment No. 599, which we shall discuss on clause 170.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
We are currently studying the Law Commission's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1018</span>
report with the Lord Chancellor's Department. The new clause would have resource implications for private landlords and public expenditure. We need to consider particularly the impact on local authorities' ability under their strategic housing responsibilities to assess and prioritise needs in relation to their resources. Pressure to depart from considered priorities could lead to difficulties such as patch-and-mend solutions or the pepper-potting of resources, which would not achieve the best value for money.<br><br>
It is important that we formulate a considered response to the Law Commission's report. On the basis that we are doing so, I invite the hon. Lady to withdraw the new clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Under-Secretary and hope that he will consider the report, because it makes sense. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</span></p>

<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
This is a strangely worded new clause and deals with infants' capacity to be tenants of dwelling houses. Hon. Members may have cottoned on to the fact that, as a Liberal Democrat, I care about what happens to young people. The Bill raises several problems in regard to people under 18 and tenancies.<br><br>
The issue is fairly complicated, but I shall try to explain the issue briefly in view of the time. There are two main reasons for the new clause. First, it is unclear whether a widow of 17 could succeed to a secure tenancy. Section 89 of the Housing Act 1985 says that the tenancy vests in a widow, but section 16 of the Law of Property Act 1925 says that it does not if she is under 18. Section 89 might override section 16, but that is not clear. A significant number of successions take place every year in which the successor, who might be a widow or a member of the family, is under 18. An amendment that makes that clear would prevent a test case from taking the issue through the courts at substantial cost to the public purse.<br><br>
The problem does not arise in the case of a statutory tenancy under the Rent Act 1977 because such a tenancy is not a legal estate, but a personal right. The same applies to statutory assured tenancies. It should be possible for people to hold a periodic tenancy for their home even though they are under 18. I have moved other amendments that seek to guarantee younger people's rights.<br><br>
The second reason for the new clause is that substantial numbers of tenancies are granted each year to people aged 16 or 17. They are frequently people who come out of care, but could be students who are renting a room. That brings into effect the provisions of the Settled Land Act 1925. The lease or tenancy is held on trust by the landlord for the infant—someone who is under 18. The landlord does so under a duty to execute a settlement by means of a principal vesting deed and to create a trust instrument in the infant's favour.<br><br>
That is something of a rigmarole, and, in the case of assured tenancies, the infant will have no security of tenure because the tenant is the landlord. That can cause many difficulties in and out of court. There is no good reason for an infant not to be the tenant in the case of a periodic tenancy or short lease of a dwelling house.<br><br>
I will set out the various subsections of the new clause. Subsection (1) outlines the purpose of the clause and says that an infant is someone who is under 18. Subsection (2) defines the tenancies that infants can hold. Subsection (3) explains the nonsense that arises from the interpretation of the different Acts, and subsection (4) confirms how they will work together. Subsection (5) sets out exceptions to the new clause.<br><br>
I hope that if the Minister cannot accept the new clause, he will go away and examine the proposals. We need sensible legislation, especially when dealing with young people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened to the hon. Lady with interest. When I first read the new clause it was not clear that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1020</span>
it would involve consideration of the vesting of settlements under the Settled Land Act 1925. I will deal with the matter in broad terms, rather than in detail.<br><br>
As I am sure that the hon. Lady is well aware, the Children Act 1989 introduced comprehensive reform of the law relating to children. Under that Act, social services authorities have lead responsibility for assessing and addressing children's needs, and, in effect, taking on those aspects of the parental role that a child's parents or others caring for the child are unable or unwilling to fulfil—including, if necessary, the provision of accommodation.<br><br>
That supported approach is rather more sensible than providing tenancies for those under 18. It has been the law of the land since 1925 that a minor cannot hold legal estate in land.<br><br>
I accept that there are people who leave home at 16 for various reasons, who may be in need of accommodation. Many, if not most, of those young people would be owed a duty under the Children Act 1989. We would expect a housing authority to operate in conjunction with a social services authority.<br><br>
When under-18s are given accommodation of their own, the present arrangements involving licences, often with social services department sponsorship, seem to work well. Indeed, people of that age often need a degree of support to maintain a home.<br><br>
There are other legal complications. Because a person under 18 cannot as a minor be liable for debts, it is questionable whether he or she can properly be granted a normal tenancy. In practice where, for example, a 17-year-old young mother is given accommodation, it may be on the basis of a licence, and, if the tenancy is not with a local authority, some body such as social services department stands as a guarantor for the rent.<br><br>
Special arrangements such as that are needed sometimes to deal with minors. The 1989 Act also provides a framework for support for minors, particularly where there is no parental support. Section 24 gives the social services authority a duty to advise, assist and befriend a child when he or she ceases to be looked after by the authority. Such advice would almost certainly cover the issue of accommodation.<br><br>
In the light of all the protection available for people under 18, I invite the hon. Lady to consider her new clause carefully. I will consider the legal arguments that she advanced. They appear to be a matter of detail for another day. On the basis of what I have said, I invite the hon. Lady to withdraw the new clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his careful consideration of the new clause. We disagree on one point of principle. Young people probably are capable in many circumstances of taking on a tenancy, and that is one reason for the new clause. The Minister clearly had not considered how the new clause tied in with other legal aspects, but I can offer him the help of the adviser who has assisted me with the legal matters involved in amending the Bill. It is interesting that so many members of the Committee are not lawyers.<br><br>
I understand the Minister's argument, but I hope that he will look at the legal aspects. I appreciate that safeguards

exist for young people. The new clause was in part a point of principle, and a way of pointing out some defects in the way in which legislation ties together. In view of the Minister's remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the new clause.</span></p>

<p>No. 569, a new schedule—<i>Rights Exercisable by Surveyor Appointed by Tenants' Association</i>—</p>
<p><i>Introductory</i></p>
<p>1.—(1) A surveyor appointed for the purposes of section (<i>Right to appoint surveyor to advise on matters relating to service charges</i>) has the rights conferred by this Schedule.</p>
<p>(2) In this Schedule—
<ol>
<li>"the tenants' association" means the association by whom the surveyor was appointed, and</li>
<li>the surveyor's "functions" are his functions in connection with the matters in respect of which he was appointed.</li></ol></p>
<p><i>Appointment of assistants</i></p>
<p>2.—(1) The surveyor may appoint such persons as he thinks fit to assist him in carrying out his functions.</p>
<p>(2) References in this Schedule to the surveyor in the context of—
<ol>
<li>being afforded any such facilities as are mentioned in paragraph 3, or</li>
<li>carrying out an inspection under paragraph 4,</li></ol>
include a person so appointed.</p>
<p><i>Right to inspect documents, &c.</i></p>
<p>3.—(1) The surveyor has a right to require the landlord or any other relevant person—
<ol>
<li>to afford him reasonable facilities for inspecting any documents sight of which is reasonably required by him for the purposes of his functions, and</li>
<li>to afford him reasonable facilities for taking copies of or extracts from any such documents.</li></ol></p>
<p>(2) In sub-paragraph (I) "other relevant person" means a person other than the landlord who is or, in relation to a future service charge, will be—
<ol>
<li>responsible for applying the proceeds of the service charge, or</li>
<li>under an obligation to a tenant who pays the service charge in respect of any matter to which the charge relates.</li></ol></p>
<p>(3) The rights conferred on the surveyor by this paragraph are exercisable by him by notice in writing given by him to the landlord or other person concerned.</p>
<p>Where a notice is given to a person other than the landlord, the surveyor shall give a copy of the notice to the landlord.</p>
<p>(4) The landlord or other person to whom notice is given shall, within the period of one week beginning with the date of the giving of the notice or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, either—
<ol>
<li>afford the surveyor the facilities required by him for inspecting and taking copies or extracts of the documents to which the notice relates, or</li>
<li>give the surveyor a notice stating that he objects to doing so for reasons specified in the notice.</li></ol></p>
<p>(5) Facilities for the inspection of any documents required under sub-paragraph (1)(a) shall be made available free of charge.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the landlord cannot treat as part of his costs of management any costs incurred by him in connection with making the facilities available.</p>
<p>(6) A reasonable charge may be made for facilities for the taking of copies or extracts required under sub-paragraph (1)(b).</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0580">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1029</span>
<p>(7) A notice is duly given under this paragraph to the landlord of a tenant if it is given to a person who receives on behalf of the landlord the rent payable by that tenant.</p>
<p>A person to whom such a notice is so given shall forward it as soon as may be to the landlord.</p>
<p><i>Right to inspect premises</i></p>
<p>4.—(1) The surveyor also has the right to inspect any common parts comprised in relevant premises or any appurtenant property.</p>
<p>(2) In sub-paragraph (1)—
<br><blockquote><p>"common parts", in relation to a building or part of a building, includes the structure and exterior of the building or part and any common facilities within it;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"relevant premises" means so much of—
<ol>
<li>the building or buildings containing the dwellings let to members of the tenants' association, and</li>
<li>any other building or buildings,</li></ol></p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>as constitute premises in relation to which management functions are discharged in respect of the costs of which service charges are payable by members of the association; and</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"appurtenant property" means so much of any property not contained in relevant premises as constitutes property in relation to which any such management functions are discharged.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>For the purposes of the above definitions "management functions" includes functions with respect to the provision of services, or the repair, maintenance or insurance of property.</p>
<p>(3) On being requested to do so, the landlord shall afford the surveyor reasonable access for the purposes of carrying out an inspection under this paragraph.</p>
<p>(4) Such reasonable access shall be afforded to the surveyor free of charge.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the landlord cannot treat as part of his costs of management any costs incurred by him in connection with affording reasonable access to the surveyor.</p>
<p>(5) A request is duly made under this paragraph to the landlord of a tenant if it is made to a person appointed by the landlord to deal with such requests or, if no such person has been appointed, to a person who receives on behalf of the landlord the rent payable by that tenant.</p>
<p>A person to whom such a request is made shall notify the landlord of the request as soon as may be.</p>
<p><i>Enforcement of rights by the court</i></p>
<p><ol>
<li>5.—If the landlord or other person to whom notice was given under paragraph 3 has not, by the end of the period of one month beginning with the date on which notice was given, complied with the notice, the court may, on the application of the surveyor, make an order requiring him to do so within such period as is specified in the order.</li>
<li>If the landlord does not, within a reasonable period after the making of a request under paragraph 4, afford the surveyor reason able access for the purposes of carrying out an inspection under that paragraph, the court may, on the application of the surveyor, make an order requiring the landlord to do so on such date as is specified in the order.</li>
<li>An application for an order under this paragraph must be made before the end of the period of four months beginning with the date on which notice was given under paragraph 3 or the request was made under paragraph 4.</li>
<li>An order under this paragraph may be made in general terms or may require the landlord or other person to do specific things, as the court thinks fit.</li></ol></p>
<p><i>Documents held by superior landlord</i></p>
<p><ol>
<li>6.—Where a landlord is required by a notice under paragraph 3 to afford the surveyor facilities for inspection or taking copies or extracts in respect of any document which is in the custody or under the control of a superior landlord—</li>
<ol>
<li>the landlord shall on receiving the notice inform the surveyor as soon as may be of that fact and of the name and address of the superior landlord, and</li>
<li>the surveyor may then give the superior landlord notice in writing requiring him to afford the facilities in question in respect of the document.</li></ol>
<li>Paragraphs 3 and 5(1) and (3) have effect, with any necessary modifications, in relation to a notice given to a superior landlord under this paragraph.</li></ol></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1030</span>
<p><i>Effect of disposal by landlord</i></p>
<p><ol>
<li>7.—Where a notice under paragraph 3 has been given or a request under paragraph 4 has been made to a landlord, and at a time when any obligations arising out of the notice or request remain to be discharged by him—
<ol>
<li>he disposes of the whole or part of his interest as landlord of any member of the tenants' association, and</li>
<li>the person acquiring that interest ("the transferee") is in a position to discharge any of those obligations to any extent,</li></ol>
that person shall be responsible for discharging those obligations to that extent, as if he had been given the notice under paragraph 3 or had received the request under paragraph 4.</li>
<li>If the landlord is, despite the disposal, still in a position to discharge those obligations, he remains responsible for doing so.<br><br>
Otherwise, the transferee is responsible for discharging them to the exclusion of the landlord.</li>
<li>In connection with the discharge of such obligations by the transferee, paragraphs 3 to 6 apply with the substitution for any reference to the date on which notice was given under paragraph 3 or the request was made under paragraph 4 of a reference to the date of the disposal.</li>
<li>In this paragraph "disposal" means a disposal whether by the creation or transfer of an estate or interest, and includes the surrender of a tenancy; and references to the transferee shall be construed accordingly.</li></ol></p>
<p><i>Effect of person ceasing to be a relevant person</i></p>
<p>8. Where a notice under paragraph 3 has been given to a person other than the landlord and, at a time when any obligations arising out of the notice remain to be discharged by him, he ceases to be such a person as is mentioned in paragraph 3(2), then, if he is still in a position to discharge those obligations to any extent he remains responsible for discharging those obligations, and the provisions of this Schedule continue to apply to him, to that extent.".—[<i>Mr. Curry.</i>]</p>

<p>No. 602, a new schedule-<i>Assessment of the Relative Value of the Landlord's Interests in the Premises and of the Qualifying Tenants Interests in the Premises</i>—
<ol>
<li>.—The following provisions shall have effect for the purpose of determining whether the Landlord's interest in the premises satisfies the valuable reversion condition set out in this Schedule and referred to in subsection 24A ("the valuable reversion condition").</li>
<li>In the event that the valuable reversion test is satisfied, the premises shall be premises to which this Part does not apply.</li>
<li>The valuable reversion condition is satisfied if the present value, as assessed in accordance with this Schedule, of the Landlord's interest or interests (taken together) in the premises is equal to or greater than one fifth of the aggregate present values, as assessed in accordance with this Schedule, of each of the qualifying tenant's leaseholds.</li>
<li>For the purposes of this Schedule the present value of the Landlord's interests in the premises shall be assessed as the sum of the present values of the Landlord's interest in the reversion of each leasehold comprised in the premises together with the sum of the Landlord's other interests (if any) in the premises, the present values of which shall be assessed in accordance with paragraph 6 of this Schedule.</li>
<li>The present value of the Landlord's interest in the reversion of each leasehold comprised in the premises shall be assessed as follows:

<ul>
<li>(a) the value of each such reversionary interest shall be assessed as the sum of R + I# where—</li>
<li>R = the present value of the right to re-entry on the expiry of the term of years of the lease.</li>
<li>I# = the present value of the right to receive for the term of years of the lease the rent reserved by the lease.</li>
<li>R shall be assessed in accordance with the formula (100-x)/100*f where</li>
<li>x = the percentage figure for the unexpired term of years of the lease taken from the table at Schedule 8 to the Taxation of Capital Gains Act 1992 or such other curved line amortisation table for wasting assets as may be prescribed by the Secretary of State.</li>
<li>f = the open market value of the leasehold at the relevant date valued on the assumption that the leasehold has an unexpired term of 999 years and that all other terms, including the rent reserved, were unchanged.</li>
<li>I# shall be assessed by applying such arithmetic formula for the calculation of the present value of a known future stream of income as may be prescribed by the Secretary of State. If no formula is prescribed, I# shall be assessed by applying any recognised formula.</li>
<li>In applying the relevant formula, the 30 year Treasury Bond yield at the relevant date, or such other long term interest rate as may be prescribed by the Secretary of State, shall be adopted as the relevant internal rate of return.</li></ul></li>
<li>All of the landlord's other interests (if any) in the premises assessed at their ordinary open market value.</li>
<li>The present value of each qualifying tenant's leasehold interests shall be assessed in accordance with the formula (x)/100<div class='sup'><span class='label label-warning'>sup</span>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I moved new clauses earlier in our deliberations, I discussed the main reasons behind amendments Nos. 548 to 550. I shall not go over those again. Suffice it to say that when the Minister replied to new clauses 85 and 86—the amendments are in much the same vein—he did not address the problem that I was trying to get at, namely, that tenants without secure tenancies are unable to get repairs done or ensure successions. Many people will know that sometimes suspended possession orders are in place for quite a long time. They are a way to ensure that, eventually, people come up with the rent, but they can go on for a long time. Those of us who have served on local authorities will know that well—it is one way to keep rent arrears down. However, some people, who could be in families and have children, are placed in a difficult situation. That is especially true if people die; what happens to the widow and the succession? I raised those issues earlier.<br><br>
Amendment No. 599 is intended to bring up to date a provision which goes back to the early part of the cen-

tury. Under section 8 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, it is a term of a residual tenancy that the dwelling be fit for human habitation at letting and for the duration of the tenancy. I have already made a proposal about houses being fit for habitation.<br><br>
Section 8 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 applies only where the rent is £80 or less a year. That figure has not been increased since 1957 and at present where the tenancy is outside the rent limit, the local housing authority can serve a notice under the Housing Act 1985. The landlord normally lodges an appeal and works often start more than a year after the date on which notice is served by the authority; that might be months after the tenant has contacted the council.<br><br>
Amendment No. 599 is in line with clause 69 of the Bill, which places a duty on the landlord to keep premises fit for the number of occupants. It is also in line with the Government's philosophy of self-help. In common with clause 69, section 8 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 enables the tenant to take matters into his or her hands if necessary to get a court order compelling the landlord to do the necessary works.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Lady said, her comments relate to an earlier discussion. It might assist her if I tell her that on the basis of what we have already discussed, my Department and I are willing carefully to consider amendment No. 599 with the Lord Chancellor's Department as part of the Law Commission's report, which I have already dealt with. I hope that that assists the hon. Lady.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister and I can probably save us all time by not carrying on with my explanation. I hope that he will give serious considerations to this matter.<br><br>
Amendment No. 600 is fairly simple. It would save an awful lot of time, because it would require the landlord to supply a rent book. At the moment, landlords have to do so only if the rent is paid weekly, but I believe that everyone should have a rent book. Problems are caused between landlords and tenants because nothing is written down. It is a nightmare. This proposal is simple and would make it clear that people must have rent books. The courts have to deal with all sorts of arguments, so this would make life much easier. I am sure that people will argue that it is easy to forge a rent book, but it is another obstacle and the amendment does have merit.<br><br>

Amendment No. 616 relates to part IV of the Housing Act 1985, which states that council tenants and housing association tenants are secure tenants. Schedule 1 to the 1985 Act sets out the circumstances in which they would not be secure tenants. Paragraph 6 of schedule 1 provides the exemption that is used to enable accommodation to be leased from the private sector for temporary accommodation. That paragraph has been extensively used to enable homeless families to be housed in temporary accommodation rather than in bed and breakfast, especially in London and our other big cities. To prevent councils from using that paragraph to avoid giving security of tenure to normal tenants, sub-paragraph (c) provides that the lessor must not be a body that is capable of granting secure tenancies.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1034</span>
Private sector leasing become more sophisticated in the latter part of the 1980s. Arrangements can be made to enable local authorities to lease from the private sector. Housing associations have occasionally bought property and let it to the council. Those arrangements are convoluted. As housing associations were capable of granting a secure tenancy and fell outside paragraph 6 of schedule 1 to the Housing Act 1985, they had to set up subsidiaries to do the work.<br><br>
In 1988, housing associations ceased to grant secure tenancies: there were exceptions—primarily transfers. Because of those limited exceptions, they remained capable of granting secure tenancies and so unable to use paragraph 6 of schedule 1 to the Housing Act 1985. The amendment would enable housing associations to use paragraph 6 without the expense of using subsidiaries. The change brought about by the 1988 Act removed the need for housing associations to be excluded so as to deal with avoidance, but the appropriate amendment was not made at the time. I, therefore, propose this amendment and hope that the Minister will see the sense of it and accept it, even if he is not minded to accept some of the others.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have already considered amendment No. 550 at some length under new clauses 85 and 86. The hon. Lady raised further concerns. I take her argument to be an expression of concern about what happens in respect of certain rights, such as repairs and succession, when a possession order has taken effect and the tenancy has come to an end. There must be a point at which a tenancy comes to an end when a possession order takes effect or a suspended order is breached. It is incumbent on the tenant who has the rights under the tenancy to ensure that he does not put himself in danger of losing his rights through the possession order taking effect or the suspended possession order being breached.<br><br>
I invite the hon. Lady to reflect on the fact that before a possession order is made there has been a court hearing at which those issues have been ventilated. It is at that stage of the proceedings that the tenant should concentrate his mind on his position and endeavour to put his house in order so as to avoid those consequences. I cannot add anything more to what I said on new clauses 85 and 86, and I cannot accept amendment No. 550.<br><br>
I have already dealt with amendment No. 599 in my intervention. Amendment No. 600 would require the landlord of any tenancy of up to seven years to provide a rent book. I understand the hon. Lady's concern that tenants should be entitled to certain basic information about their tenancy agreement with the landlord. The Committee will recall that we discussed this earlier under clause 75 and we agreed that any sensible landlord would want a written agreement with the tenant. However, for the minority of tenants without a written agreement, I agreed to consider making it a requirement for landlords to give their tenants, on request, a statement covering the main details of the oral agreement between them.<br><br>
I have given this matter further thought and I propose to table an amendment on Report that will require the landlord, where there is no written agreement or statement
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0583">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1035</span>
and an assured or assured shorthold tenant requests it, to confirm in writing the main details of the agreement between them. I propose that the statement should record what they have agreed about the amount and frequency of rent payments, any rent review arrangements, the commencement date of the tenancy and the length of the tenancy. I intend that it should be an offence to fail to provide that information within a set time scale.<br><br>
I hope that that goes a considerable way towards dealing with the hon. Lady's concerns. Unlike her amendment, it would not impose the onerous requirement of providing a rent book on all landlords, including the majority who already provide a perfectly adequate tenancy agreement. I suggest that amendment No. 600 is unnecessary and I invite the hon. Lady to withdraw it on the basis of what I have said.<br><br>
Amendment No. 616 relates to a matter that is not straightforward and involves detailed interpretation of statute. It sets out and adds to the list of bodies in paragraph 6 of schedule 1 to the Housing Act 1985. That paragraph deals with short-term letting arrangements and provides that the tenancy is not secure if, among other criteria, the landlord is not a body that is capable of granting secure tenancies. If the lessor is such a body, the tenancy will be secure. The proposed new sub-paragraph (c)(i) to (iii) covers the landlords that are within that category already. Sub-paragraph (c)(iv) adds to that list registered social landlords that in certain circumstances would be required to grant secure tenancies, but otherwise would be exempt. Given that registered social landlords will be making lettings on assured tenancies and have access to shorthold tenancies that do not give security of tenure, the amendment is not necessary.<br><br>
However, I can tell the hon. Lady that I am considering what consequential amendments are needed as a result of the creation of registered social landlords. If it should transpire that such an amendment is required, I shall introduce one.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 548 and 549 are consequential on the acceptance of the miscellaneous amendments that we have just discussed. They are, therefore, not needed. I hope that that disposes of the hon. Lady's amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure in which order I should take the amendments: I shall go backwards, because I can probably remember them better. I hope that the Minister will reconsider amendment No. 616, because it would enable empty properties to be brought back into use so that social landlords could let them to families. The legal advice that I have received suggests that there is some merit in considering that area.<br><br>
I cannot agree that it is onerous for a landlord to be required to provide his tenant with a rent book. It is much simpler than the Minister's proposal for a landlord to provide various pieces of written material. However, I am pleased that he recognises the problem. When he comes to draw up his amendment, he may consider the fact that a rent book is a simple way of dealing with the matter.<br><br>
I have taken on board what the Minister said about amendment No. 599. I have already commented on the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1036</span>
principle behind amendments Nos. 480 to 550.</span></p>
<p>I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration (Mr. David Curry)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 617, in page 133, line 27, at end insert—</span></p>
<p><i>'Consultation with respect to housing management</i></p>
<p>.—(1) Part II of the Housing Act 1985 (provision of housing accommodation) is amended as follows.</p>
<p>(2) After section 27B insert—</p>
<p><i>"Consultation with respect to housing management</i></p>
<p>Consultation with respect to management.</p>
<p><ol>
<li>27BA.—The Secretary of State may make regulations for imposing requirements on a local housing authority to consult tenants or to consider representations made to them by tenants, with respect to the exercise of their management functions (including proposals as to the exercise of those functions), in relation to any of the authority's houses or other land held for a related purpose.</li>
<li>The regulations may include provision requiring a local housing authority to consult tenants, or consider representations made by tenants, with respect to—</li>

<p>(5) In section 27AB (management agreements with tenant management organisations), in subsection (7)(b)(i), for the words from "section 27A" to the end substitute "regulations under section 27BA (consultation with respect to management)".'.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 618.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The schedule contains a number of provisions. When one starts looking into legislation, one discovers many nooks and crannies that one did not realise existed and occasionally some spring cleaning is required. One or two of these clauses fall into that category.<br><br>
It may help members of the Committee if I run through briefly the provisions of schedule 11. Paragraph 1 will repeal legislation that provides for tenants' choice. We are repealing it because it does not work and because since its introduction in 1989, it has been overtaken by newer and more effective initiatives to diversify ownership and management. Here is a Minister being brutally honest and saying that it is daft to leave in the Bill something that does not work and is therefore redundant, so we will get shot of it. The hon. Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford) will no doubt concede to my blunt reasoning.<br><br>
Paragraph 2 gives local authorities the power to make payments to assist or encourage council tenants to move to other accommodation that is owned by the authority. We all know that local authorities wish to use the best of their stock. It is helpful if people will move from accommodation that is too large for them, but it is equally reasonable that they should receive some assistance with the necessary cost of doing so. The measure puts beyond doubt the ability of local authorities to make such payments and thus assists moves to tackle what is known in the jargon as under-occupation.<br><br>
There are three housing revenue account provisions. The first will allow the Secretary of State to give authorities more discretion about how they account for expenditure and income that is associated with council leaseholders; The second will allow the Secretary of State to clarify the basis on which authorities account for competitively tendered works within the housing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1038</span>
revenue account and the housing repairs account. It also permits the Secretary of State to allow authorities to choose whether to transfer surpluses from that work to the housing revenue account.<br><br>
The third provision requires the Secretary of State to make final decisions on the amount of housing revenue account subsidy that is payable to a local housing authority for each financial year. That addresses a problem with the existing subsidy system, in that subsidy claims can be reopened many years after the amount of the subsidy payment has been agreed between the authority and the Department.<br><br>
Paragraph 5 will abolish the Secretary of State's contributions to local authorities to cover the cost of the annual grant payments that are made to owners of certain agricultural dwellings. The maximum amount is £10 per property and the administrative costs of processing the grant claims are far in excess of any amount that is disbursed. The provision has therefore become an anachronism, and we will get rid of it.<br><br>
Paragraph 6 repeals section 16 of the Housing Act 1985, which requires London housing authorities to seek the Secretary of State's consent before providing housing accommodation, commercial buildings or facilities that are connected with housing outside the Greater London area. I can see no further justification for that restriction and I therefore propose to abolish it.<br><br>
Paragraph 7 widens the Secretary of State's power to give general consent for the resale of land or houses that have been acquired from local authorities. It also clarifies the circumstances in which consultation with tenants can be dispensed with because it would be unnecessary.<br><br>
In paragraph 8, we are repealing several provisions that require my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for the Environment and the Secretary of State for Wales to obtain Treasury consent before making certain grants. Members of the Committee will no doubt want to reflect on the fact that this is one of the rare occasions on which we are getting some freedom from Treasury constraints; they will surely want to adopt the measure with unanimity, in the expectation that it may be a small seedcorn from which greater things will flow.<br><br>
Paragraph 9 is a procedural provision which removes the requirement on local authorities to consult tenants formally when they acquire properties compulsorily for onward disposal. Paragraph 10 is a technical provision which clarifies section 17 of the Housing Act 1985 when it comes to compulsory purchase and the powers of local housing authorities to acquire land for housing purposes.<br><br>
All those provisions will be welcomed by local housing authorities. The trend of them all is the attempt to provide some deregulation and relaxation. In the expectation that the hon. Member for Greenwich will be unlikely to resist a few words on the subject of tenants' choice, I commend the amendments to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Raynsford <span class='memberconstituency'>(Greenwich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister rightly forecast, I could hardly let this moment pass without a few choice words on the passing of part IV of the Housing Act 1988. I preface my remarks with the biblical observation that there is more joy in heaven over sinners who repent than over all the just people.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once again, I am corrected by the right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster. South.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Sedentary interventions are not to be encouraged. I thought that the right hon. Gentleman said "wanton", not one sinner.</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I stand corrected, as on many other occasions, in the face of the erudition of the right hon. Gentleman in respect of biblical and historical research. I hope that we shall have one or two further opportunities to hear his welcome contributions before the Committee ends.<br><br>
However, the right hon. Gentleman's intervention reminds me of a curious feature of part IV of the 1988 Act. Fewer than 1,000 tenants in the whole country have availed themselves of the provision since it was first introduced. Of those, more than 900 were within the borough of Westminster, which tells us a great deal about the attitude of tenants to Westminster city council. They voted with their feet to get away, and good luck to them. Otherwise, this was a miserable, misconceived scheme which caused immense anxiety to tenants all over the country. It wasted public money and it will not be mourned. We welcome its repeal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Government are changing their policy now simply to avoid the possibility of the rest of Westminster tenancies escaping their landlords, too?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to speculate about the Government's policy towards Westminster city council. However, in the week following revelations about Westminster's asbestos problem, tenants there have every reason to be deeply worried about how they have been treated by the council in the past. I hope that the council will be taking a more serious view of its responsibilities in future.<br><br>
The amendments appear to replace provisions in the 1993 Act for consultation with tenants over compulsory competitive tendering. We are pleased that the Government are admitting the failure of their previous provisions. However, we are troubled that the rewrite seems to have come out of the blue. No notice of the new clauses has been given either to representatives of local authorities or to tenant representatives. It is ironic that the provisions deal with consultation, yet they have been introduced with no prior consultation whatever. That does not bode well for the future of groups that will be affected.<br><br>
Given the history of clauses 41 to 48, to which we shall shortly turn, it is unfortunate that the Government have not consulted more thoroughly before presenting detailed amendments. I would welcome the Minister's observations about them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not have risen to the jocular pleasantry with which the hon. Member for Greenwich larded his speech with reference to Westminster, but he did refer to asbestos which is a serious matter. The hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1040</span>
Gentleman will be aware of the Barratt report, which was commissioned by the present leadership of the Westminster city council. It runs to 642 pages—not on the scale of the Scott report—and council officers have made it clear that it must be read as a whole. In particular, chapter 2 to around chapters 9 or 11 must be read as a comprehensive narrative. In that respect, it resembles the Scott report, which did not contain conclusions or a concise summary.<br><br>
Debate on the report will take place on 4 April, when the council's committee will have to address the issues. Details of the report will be quoted by both sides and it is wrong for conclusions or lines to be drawn until after the debate has taken place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Greenwich, I cannot allow the demise of tenants' choice to pass in silence. I remember from when I was a councillor how much time and energy was expended on that. It is interesting that it has been demonstrated over several years that tenants have given a vote of confidence to local authorities as landlords. I hope that the Government get that message. I am not hung up about who provides social housing, but in many areas—although not every area—of the country, local authority landlords have been a safe choice for many people.<br><br>
One of the debacles surrounding the issue occurred as recently as last year when tenants in Torbay were balloted by a group that had been set up. That was a great waste of money and I am not surprised that the Minister does not want such cases to happen any more. Perhaps he will comment on that. So I say goodbye to tenants' choice; I do not think that it will be mourned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Greenwich asked me about amendments Nos. 617 and 618. I can assist him. The amendment widens the power of the Secretary of State to make regulations governing local authorities' arrangements to consult their tenants on the voluntary delegation of housing management and on the process of compulsory competitive tendering. Many authorities already have extensive consultation arrangements and follow the guidance that was issued two years ago and which flowed from consultation with, among others, the local authority associations, local authorities, private sector contractors, the Chartered Institute of Housing and tenant advice agencies. It sets out the principles that we would expect authorities to follow when setting up their own local consultation arrangements. We are keeping that guidance under review, but do not believe that we need to make regulations.<br><br>
However, when we were reviewing the powers to make regulations, we noticed a defect that we think should be corrected; the present powers in sections 27A and 27AA of the Housing Act 1985 allow regulations to be made in cases where management is delegated, voluntarily or under compulsory competitive tendering, but they do not enable us to make regulations for cases where a local authority undertakes the management. As tenant consultation is a key factor, it is right that the level of consultation should be the same whether or not the authority proposes to delegate its management functions. The new section 27BA makes provision that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0586">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1041</span>
covers the same ground as the existing sections and extends the power to the case that I have just described.<br><br>
Members of the Committee have had fun on tenants' choice, but a serious question is involved. It would have been easy to leave it in place and thereby avoid a difficult 10 minutes. However, I took the view that tenants' choice is silly, ineffective, adversarial, lengthy and costly because the Housing Corporation has to set aside funds that become dead money and which could be much better used. It has been overtaken by a range of other mechanisms; we agree that housing companies should be one of those mechanisms and tenant organisations and even housing management compulsory competitive tendering are others. I felt that leaving a piece of redundant and potentially damaging legislation was unjustified and decided to undergo the 10 minutes of entertainment in Committee so that we could get rid of it.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 619, in page 134, line 27, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(5) In the case of work carried out in accordance with Part I of the Local Government Act 1988, references in this section to the amount of an authority's bid for work are, where the bid includes provision for any amount to vary with changes in circumstances, references to the amount calculated having regard to such changes in circumstances as are relevant.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(6) In the case of work carried out in accordance with Part III of the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980, references in this section to the amount of an authority's bid for work are references to the appropriate amount which the authority is entitled to credit to any relevant DLO revenue account under section 12 (contents or accounts relating to construction or maintenance work) of that Act.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment relates to the provision in part II of schedule 11 on housing finance and in particular to the way in which the costs incurred through repair works and CCT are charged to the housing revenue account.<br><br>
We understand the situation that the Government face. When a private contractor wins work under the current requirement, the value of the bid—the cost of the work in the tender—is the amount that is charged. The contractor's profits or losses are his own responsibility. Under the Bill, however, if an in-house organisation wins the work, it might be necessary to charge the eventual cost of the works, not the price that the contractor tendered to the revenue account.<br><br>
We understand and support the Government's intention to ensure that the bid price, not the cost, is charged to the revenue account. We support the idea that the housing revenue account and any direct service organisation accounts are kept separate. The direct service organisation should have to account properly for its losses and, I hope, its profits. No automatic charge should be made on the account that tenants fund through their rent.<br><br>
The amendment would tackle a potential problem with the schedule's wording. We are concerned that the use of the word "bid" in the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"the amount of the authority's successful bid"</p></blockquote>
in subsection (2)(a) could lead to a rigid situation. The amount of money at the time of the bid could remain the same irrespective of any change in circumstances. We are particularly concerned about repair work, because
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1042</span>
circumstances often change and emergencies arise. A bid might be made for work on a property's foundations, but investigations might reveal that much more work that was initially tendered for is needed. In the case of housing repair work, the number of properties varies, particularly when people act on their right to buy. Most repair work is, furthermore, tendered for on a schedule of rates basis, and there may only be a general figure for the volume of work. The volume of day-today repairs is a product of the number of requests that tenants make and of several other factors. While the schedule of rates might be fixed, the number of orders that are placed on it can vary according to circumstance.<br><br>
[MR. WILLIAM O'BRIEN <i>in the Chair</i>]<br><br>
Although we sympathise with the intention behind the Government's changes, their wording could be too restrictive. Although the eventual cost to the tenant will relate to the successful contractor's bid, we want to ensure that variations that result from changes in circumstances, in the volume of work that is ordered and in the number of properties that are covered by the contract can be taken into account when the charge is made to the housing revenue account. The amendment does that, and I hope that it will be examined sympathetically.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's amendment provides for the amount that is debited to the housing revenue account to include variations that are specified in an authority's bid. The Government have no objection to that in so far as such variations are permitted under part III of the Local Government Planning and Land Act 1980 or part I of the Local Government Act 1988.<br><br>
The proposals are, however, unnecessary. This is a highly technical matter. New section 78B contains the power to make directions. We shall, as usual, consult local authority associations, the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy and other interested bodies about the directions. We intend to align the provisions for the housing revenue account with those for compulsory competitive tendering, including cases in which there is opportunity for variation. I assure the hon. Gentleman that it is unnecessary to insert further powers to do that, and on that basis I hope that he will not press the amendment.</span></p>
<p>[MR. JOHN MCWILLIAM <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister. He has clearly taken account of the problem that the amendment highlights. Given his assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

Under section 133 of the Housing Act 1988, the purchaser of local authority houses or land must obtain the

consent of the Secretary of State for any resale. The consent requirement was introduced in 1988 to control the resale of housing that might be transferred to the private sector through large-scale voluntary transfers, which were just beginning at the time.<br><br>
The control was never intended to apply to the resale of housing or land that had been sold by local authorities before the Act was passed. The amendment simply makes it clear that section 133 does not apply in such cases. The amendment simply confirms the law to be what it has always been understood to be.</span></p>

Amendments Nos. 593, 592, and 594 are deregulatory measures. They amend the Housing Act 1985 to remove restrictions on the ability of local authorities to assist people in obtaining mortgages. The changes were foreshadowed in the March 1995 consultation paper "Deregulating Local Government—The first steps". It was welcomed by local government, and the amendments are a step towards implementing those deregulatory proposals.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me make it clear that we intend to replace clauses 41 to 48, which still stand on the Amendment Paper, so we shall vote against their standing part of the Bill. I say that with a small twinge of nostalgia in view of what happened in Committee earlier. We shall replace those clauses with 11 new clauses, which have received the general endorsement of a wide range of lenders and other parties. I shall provide the Committee with an outline of the new clauses and respond to specific questions later.<br><br>
We are trying to deal with the circumstances that arise when a housing association finds itself in financial difficulty. At present no housing association has gone bust and the associations have an excellent financial track record, which we all wish them to maintain. Using the new powers will not be a regular occurrence since associations will only rarely get into difficulties.<br><br>
However small the likelihood of insolvency, we agreed earlier in Committee that the Housing Corporation should have suitable powers to protect public funds invested in social housing and to protect the interest of tenants. That is what the new clauses are designed to achieve. We deferred consideration of clause 41 to 48 following concerns expressed building societies and other lenders about their effect. I understood to consider them further in order to achieve a better balance between the Government's interest in protecting public funds, the interests of housing association tenants and the lenders' responsibilities to their shareholders and investors.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0590">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1049</span>
We have therefore conducted extensive discussions with the Council of Mortgage Lenders, the National Federation of Housing Associations, the large insurance companies and city investors. I should particularly like to acknowledge the help of the Bradford and Bingley building society, which suggested that the outline approach that we subsequently built upon. I should also like to thank Mr. Charles Arbuthnot from Hambros bank, Jenny Gubbins from Trowers and Hamlin, Barbara Ainger from the Housing Finance Corporation, Ashley Goldblatt from the Prudential and Peter Williams and his colleagues on the social housing panel of the Council of Mortgage Lenders.<br><br>
Two points came across clearly. First, lenders are worried about any impairment of their ability to protect their investment. Any amendments that failed to meet that central concern would meet with continuing opposition and would undermine the future flow of private finance into the housing association sector.<br><br>
Secondly, lenders wish to enforce their security only as a last resort. They would therefore have no objection to the principle that the Housing Corporation should have statutory powers to address the problems that will confront an insolvent housing association—that will usually be in the lenders' own interests. However, the use of such powers must be founded on the consent of all the association's secured creditors.<br><br>
Those are the twin pillars on which the new clauses have been constructed—lenders' desire to make sure that they can protect their lending, but equally their acknowledgement that there is a role to try to mend any difficult situation which has arisen.<br><br>
Therefore, we have developed an alternative model which replaces the transfer order provisions. The new model addresses lenders' concerns but still gives the corporation a significant statutory role in the handling of an insolvency.<br><br>
The key features of the proposals are as follows: first, lenders would be required to give two sets of notices to the Housing Corporation, one just before and one immediately after they take steps to enforce their security.<br><br>
Secondly, the corporation would have a minimum of 28 days after the second notice to develop a proposal that ensures that the landlord's housing remains in the social rented sector. During that period, lenders would not be able to dispose of any of the landlord's housing. Otherwise, there might be nothing left by the time that the corporation had worked up its proposal. All the landlord's secured creditors must agree to the proposal; if they do not, the corporation bows out and insolvency proceeds without further restraint. If all creditors agree to the proposal, they and the corporation make arrangements to implement it. In other words, the Housing Corporation can act only if mandated to do so by all the secured creditors.<br><br>
Thirdly, the corporation would have powers to appoint a manager under the proposal and to give assistance. Financial assistance would require consent from the Secretary of State. The manager would be equipped with whatever powers were necessary to implement the agreed proposals and the Housing Corporation would spell them out in a statutory order.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1050</span>
Lenders favour the new model because their rights to dispose of land are suspended for a relatively short period and, more importantly, the corporation would have to act with their consent. For the Government, the model represents an improvement on the current situation because existing legislation does not give the corporation any right to intervene. In fact, there is no provision for what happens in the event of a housing association getting into difficulties, nor any powers to assist if a housing association faces insolvency.<br><br>
The model that I outlined provides a statutory role for the corporation to draw up proposals which protect tenants' and taxpayers' funds. It ensures that there is no leakage of social housing out of the sector until the corporation has tried to sort things out and it provides the corporation with statutory powers to appoint a manager to implement the agreed proposals and to provide financial assistance should that be in the public interest.<br><br>
I believe that the model represents an appropriate balance between lenders' and the Government's interests. I invite the Committee to support it. I think that it would be sensible to allow debate at this point and I am willing to outline the details of the individual clauses where appropriate, if that would be for the convenience of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In our earlier debate on the repeal under schedule 11 of part IV of the Housing Act 1988, I referred to the joy over repenting sinners. I think that I should use a similar text as a preface to my remarks on this group of clauses and new clauses. Perhaps to satisfy the concern of the right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South, I should make it clear that in this case, a single sinner is guilty of multiple repentances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman refers to <i>Hansard</i> and our original debate on clause 41, he will find that I advised him to use exactly those words.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am willing to stand as the eponymous sinner.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All I can say in response to that is that we have taken a certain pleasure in the stylish way in which the Minister has come forward in order to dispatch not just his predecessors' but his own mistakes. We note the speed with which they have been consigned to the dustbin.<br><br>
Generally, we welcome the new clauses. They strike a more sensible balance and a more realistic approach than the previous clauses and, crucially, they recognise the need for arrangements to ensure the continuation if humanly possible of the association and, indeed, the protection of its income stream. That is the real value to the lenders, a point that was made very clear to us during the initial consideration of clauses 41 to 48. The moratorium arrangement allowing the corporation to put together a package to secure the continuation of the tenancies and therefore the income stream must in general be the right approach.<br><br>
However, the new clauses have been developed in a hurry. There is no doubt about that. The Government have had to work to a tight deadline. Although there has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0591">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1051</span>
been a general welcome for the new clauses, concerns have been expressed by several commentators and interested parties and I am not sure that they have been entirely taken into account. We have, therefore, tabled several detailed amendments, which are concerned mainly to probe aspects of the proposals and to flag up sections where we suspect that there might be future difficulties. As a preface to outlining the amendments, I should tell the Minister that we suspect that the matter will need to be kept under close review. Further amendments may be needed if elements in the package are identified as not entirely satisfactory.</span></p>
<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. I gave an undertaking that I would bring the amendments back to the Committee, rather than on Report. That undertaking involved a tight schedule, and I have tried to get the amendments as well honed as possible. Of course I accept that some elements may arise that will need further consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for those comments, and the Committee is grateful to him also for tabling the amendments now, rather than on Report. That would have been unsatisfactory, given the large amount of business that we need to cover on Report.<br><br>
New clause 71 appears to contain a possible difficulty. The new clause covers the circumstances of the moratorium to which the Minister referred, and states:
<br><blockquote><p>"During the moratorium the consent of the Corporation under this section is required (except as mentioned below for any disposal of land held by the landlord".</p></blockquote>
We understand that land is the main consideration, but any association in financial difficulty will have other assets. Some of the unsecured creditors may feel that their interests will not be very well protected by the steps being taken by the corporation. They could try to intervene during the moratorium to seize the association's other assets.<br><br>
For example, the association might have substantial assets in office and computer equipment that could have some value. Does the Minister think that the gap represents a potential problem, in that unsecured creditors could seek to take advantage of a moratorium that apparently does not apply to them? In looking after their own interests, such creditors could frustrate the whole purpose of the rescue plan being developed by the Housing Corporation. I look forward to the Minister's response.<br><br>
We have proposed two amendments to new clause 73. They are in the spirit of our earlier amendments to part I of the Bill. That seems a long time ago, but at that time we tabled a number of amendments to rectify modest defects in the Bill.<br><br>
Amendment (a) to new clause 73 would substitute for the words "a registered social landlord" the words
<br><blockquote><p>"one or more other registered social landlords".</p></blockquote>
That would allow the Housing Corporation the flexibility to transfer assets to more than one alternative landlord. That would make sense when the corporation deals with an association with housing stock that is spread around a number of different areas. For such an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1052</span>
association it may be appropriate to transfer some of the assets to one social landlord in one area, and to other landlords in other areas.<br><br>
Amendment (b) specifies that the corporation should have regard to the interests
<br><blockquote><p>"of the landlord and its tenants"</p></blockquote>
as well as of the creditors. We recognise that there is a balance to be struck. The Minister referred to the balance between the interests of the lenders and the interests of the Government. The Minister also mentioned the creditors, but we are concerned about tenants' and landlords' interests. The housing association—if it is an association—or the other social landlord might be technically insolvent, but relatively blameless. It could have got into that situation as a result of a series of events over which it had only limited control. I shall not list instances from the history of housing associations, but they exist. In that situation, however, it would be wrong for the corporation not to have regard to landlords' and tenants' interests. That is why we have added their interests to the list of those about which the Housing Corporation should be concerned.<br><br>
Amendment (c) is unfortunately defective. In our hurry to draft an amendment to the hurried new clauses, we managed to attach it to the wrong part of the Bill, and it does not sit comfortably there. We shall not press the amendment, but I hope that the Minister will take on board the principle behind it. It would require the Housing Corporation to introduce a code of practice for the use of its powers under the Bill. There are several reasons for that. Such a code would ensure that we achieved the correct balance between the interests of lenders, creditors, the landlord, tenants and the public purse. Legislation cannot approach that balance in detail, and there is an obvious case for the Housing Corporation to set out in more detail than is possible in the Bill how it would exercise its powers and duties. The code would be subject to proper consultation, which would ensure that there was much less uncertainty about the Housing Corporation's likely actions. All parties would gain from that. The code would give creditors, who will probably be entirely unfamiliar with customary housing association procedures, guidance about the action that the Housing Corporation would take to resolve matters. There is much merit in producing a code. It would clarify procedures and allow for a degree of certainty about how matters would develop. It would also help to ensure that the delicate balance between conflicting interests is kept in mind.<br><br>
Amendment (b) to new clause 74 deals with the role of committee members. During the period of the moratorium, the committee will still be in place even though the Housing Corporation is appointing a manager. It will still be responsible for the activities of the association or social landlord whose affairs it oversees. Difficulties might arise, however, if committee members, directors or trustees have to act in a way that conflicts with their fiduciary or other obligations. The amendment would ensure that nothing required members, directors or trustees to act in such a manner. It would also give them the right to resign if they wanted to. The amendment is sensible and would help to clarify the position of committee members who will generally be unpaid and who will devote their time to the affairs of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0592">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1053</span>
social housing landlords, but who could be placed in a difficult position.<br><br>
We propose two amendments to new clause 75. Amendment (a) would clarify the manager's role. At present, new clause 75 gives him wide-ranging powers, which do not sit comfortably with the concept that he is there essentially to take over the land of the registered social landlord. As I stressed when I talked about the previous amendments, the committee of the association will still be in place and will still have its responsibilities. We propose that the current phrasing, which refers to the manager taking control of the affairs of the landlord, should be redrafted to read
<br><blockquote><p>"to take charge of all or any part of the land of the registered social landlord".</p></blockquote>
That would clarify the precise functions and responsibilities of the manager.<br><br>
Amendment (b) is similar to an amendment that we tabled several weeks ago with regard to the people who are appointed by the Housing Corporation to oversee the affairs of social housing landlords in difficulty. It would establish that the manager
<br><blockquote><p>"shall not be an employee of the Corporation, nor shall have been within the previous five years."</p></blockquote>
I do not need to elaborate on the reasons for that. It would ensure that there is proper independence in the role of the person who is appointed to deal with those matters.<br><br>
Finally, amendment (a) to new clause 76 would require the manager to
<br><blockquote><p>"consult and inform such tenants as he considers appropriate."</p></blockquote>
There is no need for me to stress the importance of keeping tenants involved through what would inevitably be a worrying period for them. The merits of that amendment are self-evident and I hope that it, along with the others—apart from the one that we are not going to move—will be accepted by the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having heard the Minister today, those who were not here when we originally decided to discuss clauses 41 to 48 under a different part of the Bill would not believe what took place then. The Minister has a way of making everything sound incredibly reasonable, but let us remind him of what actually happened.<br><br>
The Government had not consulted on those clauses and they discovered that the main players in the game would find it difficult to go along with them. I will say for the Minister that he is prepared to admit that he was wrong and to go away and do something about it, although he was a little quieter about that matter than about tenants' choice.<br><br>
I am pleased that there has now been consultation. When we first discussed the matter, I asked the Minister what consultation had taken place, but I did not get much of an answer. Clearly, there has now been extensive consultation and I hope that all parties will be reasonably satisfied with what eventually comes out. I am broadly in agreement with the clauses as they stand, but the Minister may need to take on board any other points that are put to him between now and Report stage. People have not had a lot of time to deal with such
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1054</span>
an important issue. The Minister said that a housing association had not yet got into difficulties, but when that happens it is the tenants who will be affected. We must therefore ensure that we get it right.<br><br>
Having said that, I wonder whether the Minister would clarify a matter that was raised with me by someone from Stroud district council when I attended the Institute of Housing conference in Torquay last Friday. Clauses 41 to 48 would provide a statutory responsibility to transfer assets but to ensure that they remain available for social housing. In the last page of the letter that he circulated to us all, the Minister said that the clauses address the Government's interests because they ensure
<br><blockquote><p>"that there is no leakage of social housing out of the sector until the Corporation has tried to sort things out".</p></blockquote>
It sounds as though there is a possibility that some social housing could eventually be lost. Will the Minister clarify that? People in rural and other areas where there have been section 106 agreements, which attempt to keep social housing in perpetuity, are very concerned. I once again congratulate the Minister on making a classic mess sound as if it was entirely reasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the enthusiasm of the hon. Member for Christchurch. The purpose of this mechanism is to prevent a failure leading to creditors realising their assets and housing passing out of the social sector. That could happen at the moment, because their is no provision. We cannot guarantee that that will not happen, because if creditors were to proceed to liquidation it is inevitable that that could be the consequence, given that they have control over their assets. The purpose of the amendments is to enable housing to be maintained in the social sector. I think that most people would agree with that. The creditors having invested in the social sector, would want to ensure that. That is the honest answer to the hon. Lady's question.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
The hon. Member for Greenwich asked me a series of questions and I shall try to respond to all of them. I accept that there is a case for extending the moratorium that applies to the disposal of land to other assets so as to keep the landlord's business intact and to maximise the corporation's chance of putting together a workable proposal. For example, we do not want to freeze the landlord's bank account nor remove the lender's access to funds specifically set aside for the purpose of redeeming debt. Therefore, I intend to consult lenders and consider this issue further. I may introduce amendments at a later stage to extend the scope of the moratorium to non-land assets. As the hon. Gentleman said, the provision may need fine tuning.<br><br>
Amendment (a) to new clause 73 would be a lawyer's delight. It is designed to ensure that the plural not the singular applies. I have sympathy with it. Under section 6 of the Interpretation Act 1978, the use of the singular in the reference to a registered social landlord includes the plural.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South leaves the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0593">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1055</span>
Committee, I want to say that it is clear that that answer is the solution to the problem that he raised about whether sins or sinners are singular or plural.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman sought is already provided by the legislation.<br><br>
On amendment (b) to new clause 73, the clause already requires the Housing Corporation to consult the landlord and tenants. I am advised that the corporation will have to take their responses into account. If it did not do so, it would not be consulting properly and would be subject to judicial review. Therefore, the purpose of the amendment is already achieved.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Greenwich does not intend to move the amendment which is tabled to the wrong part of the Bill. However, I heard what he said about codes of guidance. We must bear in mind that, although I hope that it never happens, we could be talking about an event that occurs some time ahead. We must be careful to ensure that any code is relevant to the circumstances as they occur. I will reflect upon what the hon. Gentleman said, but I shall try to maintain maximum flexibility for the players.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A long time ago I sat on committees of housing associations—I was appointed by the corporation to try to deal with associations in difficulty and I was a member of an association that was subject to Housing Corporation investigation. The biggest anxiety was the lack of clarity about the procedures and about how the Housing Corporation would act. There is a case for giving greater clarity and certainty to the many players who wonder what is going on. That is the purpose of the code and I think that it would genuinely help.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will ask the Housing Corporation, as the key player, to reflect on the usefulness of producing such a document.<br><br>
I have sympathy with the principle behind amendment (b) to new clause 74. I should like to consider in more detail the duties and rights of members, directors and trustees to ensure that the concern that the hon. Gentleman expressed cannot occur. If it cannot, there is merit in considering an amendment along the lines of that tabled by the hon. Gentleman. I regret that the hon. Gentleman did not move amendment (c) to new clause 74 because I would have got some of my own back on that. The National Federation of Housing Associations suggested two amendments. The hon. Gentleman managed to withdraw only one and we now have the unprecedented prospect of an orphan amendment because the hon. Gentleman had the decency not to seek a fostering arrangement.<br><br>
There is a problem with new clause 75 as it is presently drafted. It implies that if a manager is appointed, he will necessarily take over the management of the whole housing association. That is not how we want the clause to work. The proposals will set out a manager's functions and duties, which may or may not extend to managing the whole business. Amendment (a) is too restrictive because it implies that a manager will always take control of the landlord's land, but I am prepared to reconsider the wording of the legislation so that a manager's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1056</span>
powers are clearly linked to the role set out for him.<br><br>
With amendment (b) to new clause 75, the hon. Gentleman reproduces his earlier concerns by stipulating that the person charged with carrying out the inquiry should not work for the Housing Corporation. However, under the order-making powers, the manager's role is operational: to implement all or part of an agreed proposal. It is not an investigative role—he is not conducting a tentative inquiry into mismanagement or misconduct and is acting with the assistance and support of the corporation to achieve a clearly defined objective. So the argument in that case has not been made. New clause 77 allows the corporation to lend staff to the manager to help him with the task, which does not cause the hon. Gentleman difficulty. A manager does not need to be independent of the corporation because under the provision he acts in a clearly defined way.<br><br>
Amendment (a) to new clause 76 is defective. It gives a manager discretion over which tenants he consults and informs; those whom he chooses not to consult or inform will not be greatly comforted by the knowledge that other people receive that privilege. He may carry out tasks where it would be sensible and right to consult and inform the tenants because to do so would make his job easier. The corporation can direct the manager to ensure that such consultation is carried out in the case of a task in which that is important. There would be no purpose in consulting tenants about a complicated accountancy measure, for example. We want the corporation to make pragmatic judgments so that consultation takes place in circumstances where it is obviously desirable and not in circumstances where it is less desirable.<br><br>
I hope that I have answered the issue raised by the hon. Member for Greenwich and I am grateful to him and the hon. Member for Christchurch for broadly supporting the new clauses. I acknowledge that we may need to return to elements of them later to ensure that they are absolutely right. I commend them to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that helpful response. Bearing in mind the need to make progress and the fact that we will need to return to some of the issues later, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The amendments have not been moved yet. Let me help the Committee. When we come to the amendments on the selection list, it will be sufficient for the hon. Gentleman not to say anything for them to be withdrawn.<br><br>
We shall have a series of close and difficult calls in a moment and I warn hon. Members to keep their eyes on the amendment paper so that they know what they are voting on.</span></p>

THE COMMON COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF LONDON</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a small technical question about the clause. The drafting seems extraordinarily broad. It allows the Common Council of the City of London to
<br><blockquote><p>"appoint a committee, consisting of so many persons as they think fit, for any purposes of this Act which in their opinion may be better regulated and managed by means of a committee."</p></blockquote>
I assume that the Common Council of the City of London has had some influence over the preparation and inclusion of the clause, so why does it feel it to be necessary?<br><br>
I must confess that I have a more light-hearted purpose, too: I want to redress a balance. On so many occasions, I have raised matters concerning the western part of the constituency of the right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South and this clause gives me a unique opportunity to mention the eastern part of his constituency. I hope that I will succeed in eliciting from the right hon. Gentleman one of his characteristic and pithy responses, but I would also genuinely like some enlightenment about why the Common Council believes that it needs to appoint a committee to carry out functions contained in the Bill. I should have thought that it already has substantial committees with well-defined responsibilities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who has resolved a dilemma for me. I am in possession of correspondence between the City Corporation and the Department of the Environment about whether an amendment should be tabled. However, I was advised by the City Corporation at an interim and earlier stage that it believed that the Government would table the amendment. Therefore, I know perfectly well what the correspondence involves, but, having received no instructions from the City Corporation to table an amendment, I have not done so. If it becomes in any way necessary for me to provide an explanation to the hon. Member for Greenwich about the background to the clause, I will do so gladly, but I am confident that my hon. Friend the Minister knows it all already.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my right hon. Friend's intervention, which has enabled me to acquire a rapid education on the subject. The City of London does not have the standard powers of a local authority. Therefore, it has to be endowed with them and we have merely brought forward the provisions as they appear in the 1985 Act.</span></p>

MINOR DEFINITIONS: GENERAL</div> <!-- title -->
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 620, in page 90, line 29, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>' "public body" means for the purposes of section (Disposal of properties by public sector bodies) below a Department of State, an Executive Agency or a non-departmental public body which owns any home, flat or hostel, but does not include a local authority.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take new clause 82—<i>Disposal of properties by public sector bodies</i>—
<ol>
<li>'.—A local authority may via a registered housing association, designated by it for this purpose in areas of housing need, be entitled for a price determined in accordance with subsection (3) below to lease or buy any surplus house, flat or hostel owned by any public sector body.</li>
<li>Where a lease has been purchased in accordance with subsection (1) above, the rent charged shall be comparable with the rent for similar properties let by the local housing authority or the registered housing association.</li>
<li>The sale price for any such disposal shall be decided by the District Valuer.'.</li></ol></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment and new clause cover empty properties owned by Government Departments, especially those owned by the Ministry of Defence.<br><br>
All hon. Members know that there is a serious problem with empty Ministry of Defence properties in this country. There are too many and the numbers have grown remorselessly. At the last count, about 13,000 Ministry of Defence properties were recorded as empty. They represent a high proportion of the Ministry of Defence's total stock, and are a source of real anxiety for people worried about the use of public assets. They also concern homeless people and those in housing need in areas where surplus Ministry of Defence stock stands empty. They constitute an affront, and action must be taken to bring the properties back into use.<br><br>
The Government appointed a task force to look into the question. That task force comprised an independent chairman and other members, and reported just over a year ago with a series of recommendations, among which was the clear suggestion that surplus property should be used to provide for local people in need of housing.<br><br>
The amendment would ensure that the Government do what they said that they would do when they accepted the task force's recommendations. At that time, they implied that they would ensure that empty Ministry of Defence property would be made available to meet local housing needs.<br><br>
Unfortunately, since then the Government have moved in a different direction. They have put up for sale the entire Ministry of Defence married quarters estate, which included many empty properties. There is a real worry that those properties will be lost and will not be available to meet pressing housing needs. The amendment would ensure that such properties are put to the use recommended by the task force and supported by the Government.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1060</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As chairman of the all-party homelessness group, I rise to tell the Committee that the group recently has discussed the issue, as the hon. Member for Greenwich knows. It was resolved that the group would send a deputation to see the appropriate Minister—ideally, the Secretary of State—at the Ministry of Defence.<br><br>
That matter is ongoing and has not yet been consummated. I wait to discover the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the concern over this issue. I acknowledge the work of Antony Fletcher and the Empty Homes Agency. I suspect that they had a small part in framing the amendment.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Greenwich was right in his resume of the history of the problem. The task force did suggest that the Ministry of Defence's accommodation be used in social housing. The trouble is, frankly, that we have not had enough success in meeting that recommendation.<br><br>
We have decided that we should explore different opportunities. The Ministry of Defence wants to dispose of the married quarters estate. My interest as Minister with responsibility for housing is to ensure that such properties are put to effective use as soon as possible. It is of less interest whether they are social or low-cost housing for people who are moving to owner-occupation—my concern is that they are used.<br><br>
I noted the remarks of my right hon. Friend the Member for City of London and Westminster, South about the homelessness group's intention to make representations on the matter, and we do not want to pre-empt those. We shall, however, put the Ministry of Defence houses into effective use more quickly under the Bill than if we followed current procedures. We have done our best to put properties to effective use.<br><br>
The Ministry of Defence has had special problems in recent years in managing its housing stock because of the reduction of the forces and rationalisation under "Options for Change". Last year, 4,000 empty Government homes were brought back into use or sold. We are now building on that progress and have set targets for 1995–96 to reduce the number of empty properties and the length of time that they remain empty. The Ministry of Defence aims to dispose of 4,000 surplus homes by this summer—2,500 as part of the proposed sale of the whole married quarters estate and 1,500 through other, smaller scale sales, which are already in progress.<br><br>
In those circumstances, it would not be right to create a statutory local authority monopoly over the purchase or lease of surplus Government homes. We have duty to the taxpayer to ensure value for money, but we cannot do so if Departments are prevented by statute from considering all the options for disposing of properties. The course of action that is set out in the Bill is more likely to put those homes more rapidly to effective use. I cannot, therefore, accept the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that it was inevitable that we should reach the end of our proceedings without agreeing on this issue. The Minister has once again had to carry the can for the sins of others—in this case, the Ministry of Defence, which is guilty of dragging its feet.<br><br>

I am grateful to the right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South for his intervention, and hope that his proposed delegation to the Secretary of State for Defence or another Minister at the Ministry of Defence will engender a more responsive and positive approach.<br><br>
I understand that the Minister is unable to accept the amendment, which I shall not press to a vote. None the less, empty MOD properties represent a considerable asset and I regret that it continues to be wasted at a time when many people are homeless or badly housed and would dearly love to be given one of those homes. That is a matter of profound regret, and the empty homes agencies are to be congratulated on their continuing campaign to ensure that effective action is taken. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p>Government new clause 67—<i>Directions as to certain charges: supplementary provisions.</i></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The new clauses address the concern about which the Committee heard this morning, that were local authorities receive assistance under specific Government programmes, charges to leaseholders may result. We know from the response to a good practice guide, which we issued last year, that some local authorities are concerned that they have a duty to charge leaseholders for costs that are incurred by the local authority under the terms of the lease, notwithstanding the fact that the funding comes from Government sources through certain programmes. We were asked to consider legislation to clarify the position for the future.<br><br>
We went out to consultation on the matter early this year and we propose to take a power for the Secretary of State to issue directions to local authorities and other landlords. Those directions would enable them to reduce the charges to their leaseholders. They would set out the extent to which they may do that, and they might set out the criteria to be taken into account. The Secretary of State will have the power to require landlords to reduce charges, but only where they are receiving specific additional funding for a scheme, and only for schemes where funding is applied for after the date of the direction.<br><br>
We propose to use those wide-ranging powers to help leaseholders of various social landlords who face charges for various types of repair, maintenance or improvement works. They are funded in a variety of ways. Some of them have already been invoiced, some of them are still under way and some of them have yet to be carried out. We need maximum flexibility so that we can ensure that leaseholders are treated fairly and consistently and that landlords are able to take decisions that will be fair to leaseholders, tenants and others with an interest, including council taxpayers.<br><br>
We intend to issue directions as soon as possible after the primary legislation comes into force. They will give landlords discretion to reduce charges on categories of current and past schemes that have received specific additional assistance from the Government under estate action, city challenge and the single regeneration budget challenge fund. We also intend to issue directions that will require or allow landlords to reduce charges on schemes where specific additional funding is applied for. Again, that will be from the date of the direction and for a variety of schemes. We will also issue directions that will give landlords the freedom to reduce charges on, for instance, particularly high-cost schemes, irrespective of whether they receive specific additional funding.<br><br>
The directions will set out the circumstances in which charges can be reduced. Charges might need to be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0598">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1065</span>
above a certain level, although we would consider applications even where the circumstances are not met. We are also considering setting criteria that landlords should take into account when deciding whether and by how much to reduce charges.<br><br>
The new clauses are designed to assist and to allay the concerns of leaseholders who are worried that they may face higher service charges as a result of their local authority carrying out works under specific Government programmes. I commend them to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak to a couple of amendments that have been tabled in my name. I know that we are anxious to get through this before we have to vote Downstairs.<br><br>
I shall be as brief as I can. I welcome the new clauses, which enable landlords to lessen the charges to lessees. However, there is a discrepancy in regard to housing associations. Local councils are part of government and are probably used to not being completely reimbursed by central Government, but it is iniquitous for housing associations not to be reimbursed for money lost through reducing charges to their tenants. I ask the Secretary of State to examine the amendments carefully and favourably. I know that the Minister is an honourable man and I am sure that he wants the losses of housing associations to be reimbursed, but we all know how the Treasury treats such matters. I hope that the principle can be established on the face of the Bill rather than being left to the discretion of the Treasury.</span></p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Lady. The important point is the one that she made in regard to the date on which the legislation will take effect. The Secretary of State can make a direction requiring a social landlord to waive or reduce charges only where funding is applied for on or after the date of the direction. Prior to that, registered social landlords will have the flexibility and discretion to decide for themselves whether or not to waive or reduce the charges. It is therefore for registered social landlords, who will be fully aware of the situation, to consider how the works are to be funded.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I have an assurance from the Minister that we are talking about something that goes through the housing revenue account of a local authority and that that could in no sense affect the general fund of an authority so that if finds that that money counts towards its capping limit, thereby causing problems?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Gentleman that assurance. The important point is that the provision is designed to avoid a form of double funding whereby the local authority receives assistance under the Government grant schemes while also charging the leaseholders. The concerns of the hon. Member for Christchurch can be allayed by a close reading of the relevant section.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the new clauses. The Minister and I have corresponded about the circumstances that gave rise to them, and I look forward to the directors. I hope that they will ease leaseholders' concerns where works are taking place.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1066</span>
I should like to raise a matter that was recently brought to my attention; it was probably unforeseen, but could be problematical. I am told that some lenders, who have in the past been concerned about other parts of the legislation, have alighted with concern on the reference in the new clause to
<br><blockquote><p>"financial assistance of any kind",</p></blockquote>
including grant, and are wondering whether that may make it possible for the Government to give directions on the use of housing association grant or social housing grant in a way that might undermine lenders' security. I hesitate to raise that when we thought that we had put clauses 41 to 48 and their replacements to bed, but it is a genuine concern and I should be sorry if we concluded the Committee stage of the Bill without that issue being mentioned so that the Minister can look at it in detail before coming back to it on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can put that issue to bed and give it a nightcap. I shall look into it. I believe that I have dealt with the matters that have been raised.</span></p>

Despite what he says, what he thinks happens is not written into the Bill. He may wish to comment on that and he may not. I am in no position to move any of the amendments, but I should be interested to hear his comments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My only comment is that I rely upon my interpretation of new clause 66(2), which, as I read it, would not permit the Secretary of State to require charges to be reduced or waived where

MORATORIUM ON DISPOSAL OF LAND, &C.</div> <!-- title -->
<p><ol>
<li>'.—Where any of the events mentioned in section (<i>Further notice to be given to the Corporation</i>) occurs in relation to a registered social landlord, there is a moratorium on the disposal of land held by the landlord.</li>
<li>During the moratorium the consent of the Corporation under this section is required (except as mentioned below) for any disposal of land held by the landlord, whether by the landlord itself or by a liquidator, an administrator, an administrative receiver or a receiver appointed under any charge whether fixed or floating.</li>
<ul>
<li>Consent under this section may be given in advance and may be given subject to conditions.</li></ul>
<li>Consent is not required under this section for any such disposal as is mentioned in section 9(1) or (2) (lettings and other disposals not requiring consent under section 8).</li>
<li>A disposal made without the consent required by this section is void.</li>
<li>Nothing in this section prevents a liquidator from disclaiming any land held by the landlord as onerous property.</li>
<li>The provisions of this section apply in relation to any existing or future interest of the landlord in rent or other receipts arising from land as they apply to an interest in land.'.—[<i>Mr. Curry.</i>]</li></ol></p>

PERIOD OF MORATORIUM</div> <!-- title -->
<p><ol>
<li>'.—Subject to the following provisions, the moratorium referred to in section (<i>Moratorium on disposal of land, &c.</i>) begins with the occurrence of the event and ends at the end of the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which notice of the event was given to the Corporation under section (<i>Further notice to be given to the Corporation</i>) or, if no such notice was required, with the date on which the event occurred.</li>
<li>The taking of any further step as mentioned in section (<i>Further notice to be given to the Corporation</i>) at a time when a moratorium is already in force does not start a further moratorium or affect the duration of the existing one.</li>
<li>A moratorium may be extended from time to time with the consent of all the landlord's secured creditors.</li>
<ul>
<li>Notice of any such extension shall be given by the Corporation to—</li>
<ol>
<li>the landlord, and</li>
<li>any liquidator, administrative receiver, receiver or administrator appointed in respect of the landlord or any land held by it.</li></ol></ul>
<li>When a moratorium ends the Corporation shall give notice of that fact to the landlord and landlord's secured creditors.</li>
<ul>
<li>The notice shall also inform them of the effect of the following provisions of this section.</li></ul>
<li>If any further step as mentioned in section (<i>Further notice to be given to the Corporation</i>) occurs within the period of three years after the end of the original period of the moratorium, the moratorium may be renewed with the consent of all the landlord's secured creditors (which may be given before or after the step is taken).</li>
<ul>
<li>Notice of any such renewal shall be given by the Corporation to the persons to whom notice of an extension is required to be given under subsection (3).</li></ul>
<li>If a moratorium ends without any proposals being agreed, then, for a period of three years the taking of any further step as mentioned in section (<i>Further notice to be given to the Corporation</i>) does not start a further moratorium except with the consent of the landlord's secured creditors as mentioned in subsection (5) above.'.—[<i>Mr. Curry.</i>]</li></ol></p>

PROPOSALS AS TO OWNERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT OF LANDLORD'S LAND</div> <!-- title -->
<p>'.—(1) During the moratorium (see sections (<i>(Moratorium on disposal of land, &c.</i>) and (<i>Period of moratorium</i>)) the Corporation may make proposals as to the future ownership and management of the land held by the registered social landlord, designed to secure the continued proper management of the landlord's land by a registered social landlord.</p>
<p>(2) In drawing up its proposals the Corporation—
<ol>
<li>shall consult the landlord and, so far as is practicable, its tenants, and</li>
<li>shall have regard to the interests of all the landlord's credi tors, both secured and unsecured.</li></ol></p>
<p>(3) The Corporation shall also consult—
<ol>
<li>where the landlord is an industrial and provident society, the appropriate registrar, and</li>
<li>where the landlord is a registered charity, the Charity Commissioners.</li></ol></p>
<p>(4) No proposals shall be made under which—
<ol>
<li>a preferential debt of the landlord is to be paid otherwise than in priority to debts which are not preferential debts, or</li>
<li>a preferential creditor is to be paid a smaller proportion of his preferential debt than another preferential creditor, except with the concurrence of the creditor concerned.</li></ol>
In this subsection references to preferential debts and preferential creditors have the same meaning as in the Insolvency Act 1986.</p>
<p>(5) Where the landlord is a charity the proposals shall not require the landlord to act outside the terms of its charitable trusts, and any disposal of housing accommodation occupied under a tenancy or licence from the landlord must be to another charity whose objects appear to the Corporation to be, as nearly as practicable, akin to those of the landlord.</p>
<p>(6) The Corporation shall serve a copy of its proposals on—
<ol>
<li>the landlord and its officers,</li>
<li>the secured creditors of the landlord,</li>
<li>any liquidator, administrator, administrative receiver or receiver appointed in respect of the landlord or its land, and</li>
<li>where the landlord is an industrial and provident society or a company registered under the Companies Act 1985, the appropriate registrar or the companies registrar, as the case may be;</li></ol>
and it shall make such arrangements as it considers appropriate to see that the members, tenants and unsecured creditors of the landlord are informed of the proposals.'.—[<i>Mr. Curry.</i>]</p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. We have reached the end of our deliberations and I should like to thank both you and Mrs. Winterton for the efficiency and expedition of your Chairmanship. You have both conducted our proceedings with good humour and discipline.<br><br>
Mrs. Winterton occasionally showed some signs of winsomeness, as she referred to the hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) as handsome and me as cute. I am only grateful, Mr. McWilliam, that the winsomeness was evinced by her and not by you. I do not know whether a Committee can specify its Chairman, but I doubt whether this Committee could have found a more efficient team.<br><br>
Our debate has ranged far and wide, encompassing Canute, Cleopatra and the brothels in old Westminster. There have been frequent references to sinners—both singular and plural—but we have learnt that it does not matter.<br><br>
Mentioning Cleopatra reminds me of the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson), who is not present just now. I am grateful to her for confirming what I had always suspected—that Hampstead intellectuals do not wash. The Committee will recall our earlier debate, in which we discussed the need to unblock drains when premises were converted from intellectual use to social housing use because of a change of habit.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Member for City of London and Westminster, South made marvellous cameo interventions. His knowledge of parliamentary folklore and procedure makes him a veritable "Wisden" of parliamentary activity. I was about to say that the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz) had made cameo appearances, but we are currently experiencing one of his cameo disappearances, so I shall not dwell on the matter.<br><br>
I note a new and sinister phenomenon: the appearance of the brooding shadow of the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) in the doorway. The new Labour thought police were checking up on any Opposition spending commitments. I was able to reassure the hon. Gentleman that not a word had passed the lips of the hon. Member for Greenwich to betray the slightest indication of the behaviour of a Labour Government.<br><br>
The intimate knowledge that we gleaned from my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough (Mr. Sykes) about Scarborough council made it rival "The Archers" in the early stages of our proceedings. I was going to congratulate the hon. Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Walker) on his impeccable record in his approach to the Bill, but I regret to say that he spoilt it today.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1074</span>
The hon. Member for Christchurch had to make a solo performance for her party. She did so with great aplomb. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Greenwich for the courtesy with which we conducted our debates.<br><br>
We have had a serious, good humoured, civilised and honourable exchange. I hope that we have done the House some credit. However, you, Mr. McWilliam, and Mrs. Winterton must take most of the credit for the conduct of our proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I call Mr. Raynsford, further to that dubious point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that traditional point of order, I associate Opposition members of the Committee with the Minister's remarks. Our proceedings have been interesting. They have ranged widely, but have rarely been out of order. For that, we owe a great deal to you, Mr. McWilliam, and to Mrs. Winterton.<br><br>
The scope and variety of housing topics that the Committee tackled is amazing. We covered them thoroughly but expeditiously. We have amended the Bill extensively, sometimes with Government support, at other times, without it. The Committee has been constructive, and has improved a Bill about which we retain considerable reservations. Some of the amendments that have been accepted will have a significant impact on the measure. I hope that they will remain after further discussion of the Bill.<br><br>
While we bring our proceedings in Committee to an end, we look forward to what will happen on Report and in another place. I suspect that the Bill will go through many interesting stages before it reaches the end of the road. We have often looked to literary sources for inspiration. Therefore, I shall delve once again into "Henry IV, Part I", which we have quoted often. Tonight, as we reach the end of long and invigorating Committee proceedings, it seems appropriate to remember the opening words of the play. I hope that they do not apply entirely to us, but they contain an element of truth. I am sure that the Minister and some of his colleagues feel, in the opening words of "Henry IV, Part I",
<br><blockquote><p>"So shaken as we are, so wan with care."</p></blockquote>
Thank you very much, Mr. McWilliam for your exemplary chairmanship. You have been firm, but friendly. Those remarks apply also to Mrs. Winterton, who looked after us in a delightful way. My name begins with "R" and I have not explored the adjectives that might be applied to me—"repulsive" springs to mind, but such a description would never pass Mrs. Winterton's lips.<br><br>
We cannot end our proceedings without thinking a little about some of the education that we have received, especially, from the right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South. Without his many interventions our proceedings would have been less enjoyable and we would have learnt a lot less about interesting phases in the country's history. Although we shall not always see eye to eye with the local authority in his constituency, we greatly appreciate his contribution to the Committee.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1075</span>
I want to thank my hon. Friends and all members of the Committee for what has been an enjoyable and stimulating Committee. There have been divisions and we have disagreed, but we have done so with good humour and with effect. Like the Minister, I believe that, in many ways, the Committee has been a credit to the House and to Parliament. I thank you, Mr. McWilliam, and Mrs. Winterton for all that you have done to enable the Committee to puruse its business expeditiously, effectively and in such good spirit.</span></p>
<p>7.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that spurious point of order,—I believe that that is how it was phrased—Mr. McWilliam. I thank you, Mr. McWilliam, and Mrs. Winterton for the good way in which you have kept us in order and helped us along our way. When I first arrived in the House, the first Committee on which I sat considered the Finance Bill. I learnt a lot from you on that occasion, Mr. McWilliam, and I have learnt a lot during this Committee. I thank both Chairmen for what they have done.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Greenwich spoke of how we have conducted the Committee. When I was launched into the Committee stage of the Finance Bill, I did not think that we conducted our business as well as we have in this Committee. We have been efficient and used our time sensibly and, as the hon. Member for Greenwich said, we hope that that may be an example to others in the House. I hope that those hon. Members who serve on other Committees will take with them the best practice that has been evident here.<br><br>
I thank the Minister and others for their good humour. We have been discussing serious issues and we take them seriously, but the good humour and interesting interventions that we have heard—my knowledge of English literature has improved greatly—have made the Committee a much more pleasant experience than I ever imagined. When we set out in January, I wondered how on earth I would bear being in Committee until April.<br><br>
I thank all the people who have made this Committee a much lighter load than it would otherwise have been. I thank the Minister for his comments about my performance in Committee because it is pretty hard going as a solo act. Everyone has been extremely generous towards me, and particularly generous in accepting some of my amendments. I thank everyone, but particularly the two Chairmen who have served us so well and helped the Committee to be a pleasant experience when it could have been a quite gruelling one.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1076</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I promise to be extremely brief, but Cleopatra should have the last word. The one thing we did not hear about her in Committee was the production in Paris in the last century in which Sarah Bernhardt played her and two Victorian ladies confided to each other in the interval that it was, "so unlike the home life of our own dear Queen".<br><br>
There have been moments when the Opposition must have thought that the Government were being complacent, and there have certainly been moments when Conservative Members thought that the Opposition were exaggerating. However, that is in the spirit of the view of Sarah Bernhardt's performance.<br><br>
The fact that we have had such an amicable Committee is very much due to you, Mr. McWilliam, and to Mrs. Winterton and to the benign, but stern way in which you have ruled us. Had Mrs. Winterton addressed the hon. Member for Greenwich, she might have done so in the phrases that belong in "1066 and all that" in which the cavaliers were described as romantic, but wrong and the roundheads as right, but repulsive. I offer the hon. Member for Greenwich the choice between those two.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is always a pleasure to follow my Member of Parliament.<br><br>
May I thank some other people as well because this Committee does not function solely through hon. Members? An awful lot goes on elsewhere as well. For example, this is the first time that I have been double Clerked, which is testimony to the length and complexity of the Bill. I thank both the Clerks for their valuable contribution, the two <i>Hansard</i> ladies for recording our purple and not-so-purple prose and especially the other <i>Hansard</i> people who transcribe our words and produce copies for the next morning.<br><br>
I thank the doorkeepers and the policemen and, most of all, the members of the Committee, especially the hon. Members for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry), for Greenwich, for Christchurch and the right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South, because without the co-operation of hon. Members, the Committee would not have run so smoothly. Mind you, I have been called some strange things in Committee because of the inadvertent use of the second person, but being described as half pregnant by the Minister was the best I have heard. I thank all of you very much.</span></p>
