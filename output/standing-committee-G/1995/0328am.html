<br><blockquote><p>That during further proceedings on the Housing Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.—[<i>Mr. Brandreth.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously spring is in the air, but we have a lot of business to get through before we rise for the Easter recess and I hope that the Committee will bear that in mind throughout this morning's proceedings.</span></p>

Clause 82</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
VALUATION: COLLECTIVE ENFRANCHISEMENT</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed [26 March],</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hampstead and Highgate)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee will recall the passionate contribution that the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (Mr. Ashby) made during our previous sitting. He was arguing for leaseholders to be released from the homes that they regarded as virtual prisons because of the oppression of freeholders. While making his irrefutable argument, the hon. Gentleman urged his colleagues to be courageous and to consider the amendments favourably. No one inside or outside the Room can doubt the hon. Gentleman's courage.<br><br>
The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire defined the history of how the great estates, many of which are still acting as feudal landlords, obtained their land and he said that land was the priority. I do not share his view about how the great estates came into being. A more accurate definition would be to refer to them as robber barons. If we bear in mind the enclosures, the way in which they increased the size of their land was plain theft. In many instances, they hung on to their estates by acting seditiously and working against the king or the noble lord who was in power at the time.<br><br>
We are discussing people who are living a mere four years from the 21st century, yet who still cannot regard where they live as their home because of the current anomalies in the legal system for leaseholders and their inability to obtain the freehold. Great disappointment was expressed to members of the Committee who discussed the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Bill in 1993. Leaseholders had been led to believe by the Conservative party's manifesto in 1992 that a law
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 868</span>
would be introduced to relieve them from the burdens under which they were living because of iniquitous laws. When they saw how the Government were backtracking on promises, they made clear their despair to members of that Committee. That sense of disappointment cannot be exaggerated.<br><br>
In common with my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford), I pay tribute to Joan South and the Leashold Enfranchisement Association and members of the Campaign Against Residential Leasehold Abuse. They must feel a sense of déjà vu in that, three years down the line, we are attempting to present yet again the same irrefutable arguments. It is leaseholders' money that maintains what the right hon. Member for the City of London and Westminster, South (Mr. Brooke) referred to as the architectural contribution of the great estates to central London. Leaseholders' money pays for repairs and decoration. The great estates pay almost no money out of their pockets to maintain the land.<br><br>
One argument that was put forward by the great estates in 1993 was that they were, in effect, holding those great estates in trust for their families. However, they are denying to their leaseholders the right—I understood that this was the Prime Minister's purpose—to allow people to pass what they own on to their own. The owners can only maintain their great estates. They can pass on that inheritance only because of the financial contribution made year in, year out, by their leaseholders.<br><br>
It is surely inequitable and it should not be accepted by the House that people should be denied the knowledge that the place where they have lived for many years is genuinely their home—the place that they have maintained out of their own pocket, which has been their domicile for a considerable number of years and in which they have raised their children. Indeed, as we heard during debates on the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, grandchildren, too, may have come to regard such places as the family home. If, at the end of the lease, families are unable to raise the necessary funds, or if they have neither the time nor the financial resources to contest the great estate owners in court, they will find their lifetime's commitment to their homes blown away by anomalies in the law.<br><br>
I strongly urge Conservative Members to look favourably on amendments to chapter II. We are talking of liberating people. The Government's failure to keep the promises that they made in 1992, has meant that far too many homes—the family's primary and first place of refuge—are turning into highly expensive prisons.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. James Clappison)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope now, for the first and only time, to perform the feat of facing in both directions at the same time, by seeking to answer the debate on clause 82 while doing justice to the principle of leasehold enfranchisement. The hon. Member for Greenwich set the precedent by painting the picture and setting the general background. The hon. Gentleman is a veteran of this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0494">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 869</span>
genre of legislation, if not a cognoscente. He has made personal judgments on some Conservative Members; in turn, we can say that we have come to know the hon. Gentleman a little better during our consideration of the Bill. We know that the hon. Gentleman has an encyclopaedic knowledge of statutes and law on housing. We have come to know also his impish sense of mischief. From to time he paints with a broad brush; indeed, he painted with rather broad strokes on Tuesday evening. He knows that the Government have progressively built up tenants' rights and put in place some important reforms.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Greenwich spoke about the abuses that have recently come to light. He dealt with them, quite properly, at some length and mentioned specific cases, which, because various newspapers and the media generally have revealed them, are now well known. Abuses inflicted upon tenants have come to light. The Government share the desire to put right such abuses and to give tenants relief.<br><br>
The amendments that we shall propose will be targeted on dealing with such abuses, some of which were highlighted by the hon. Member for Greenwich. Although we shall not go along every avenue that the hon. Gentleman would like us to take, we are intent upon targeting reform on such matters as the abuse of service charges, the use of forfeiture, and how landlords have used the apparatus of the law. I remind the hon. Gentleman that the changes that we wish to make do not yet appear in the Bill; they will be made in amendments. The changes will be practical and, we hope, effective reforms, that will bring redress in many of the areas identified by the hon. Gentleman. We believe that they will bring redress for tenants who have found it necessary to seek to uphold their rights in the face of abuses by landlords. I do not want to go too far down that path, but I assure the Committee that what we propose will represent a significant strengthening of leaseholders' rights to deal, in particular, with bad managers, without placing too great a burden on those many property managers who do a good job and who do not come to public attention in the same way as bad managers do.<br><br>
We have also gone some way down the path of enfranchisement. I think that it will have become clear to the Committee that there are strong feelings about that on both sides of the argument. The Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 was a significant step forward in terms of principle, and conferred a significant right on leaseholders, but any legislative measure on the subject calls for a principled and balanced approach, and great care has been taken to strike the right balance and uphold the right principles in framing the legislation. When we consider the amendments we may revisit the 1993 Act, and no doubt some familiar arguments will come to light. I suggest to the Committee that, although the Act may have had a slow start in some respects, it is now having an effect, and the pace is beginning to increase to enable leaseholders to take advantage of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 870</span>
that important step forward. That is the Government's approach and I believe that clause 82 will help leaseholders, so I commend it to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Raynsford <span class='memberconstituency'>(Greenwich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-secretary of State will have some difficulty. His words were similar to those of his predecessor the right hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) some three years ago, and those of the latter's predecessor, the right hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Mr. Patten) in 1987. We were told on both occasions that the measures introduced by the Government would provide effective leasehold reform and deal with the abuses. It was said that the Opposition were going over the top in complaining that the measures were not effective, and we were told that everything would be all right.<br><br>
We have heard the same from the Under-Secretary this morning. Those of us with long memories—the Under-Secretary kindly acknowledged the fact that I have a long memory in the field—are only too well aware of the failure of those previous measures. As to the 1993 legislation, I have figures that show that, to date, only 22 enfranchisement decisions nationally have gone to leasehold valuation tribunals—that is the total figure since the Act came into force in November 1993. Not all those cases have been completed, as some are subject to appeal, so we are dealing with a very small number of cases, especially in light of the fact that Ministers said at the time that about 750,000 leaseholders stood to benefit from the Act.<br><br>
I am still waiting for an answer on the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987. I asked the Minister on Tuesday, and his predecessor in 1993, how many people had benefited from the provisions of that Act, specifically parts II and III, which were supposed to give redress to leaseholders against landlords' failure to carry out their management functions. To the best of my knowledge, no one has benefited from those provisions, which have been on the statute book for nine years.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary will have to do rather better to convince his hon. Friends, let alone Opposition Members, that existing legislation is satisfactory and that the measures in the Bill will be satisfactory. They come from a stable that does not have a good track record, and we shall seek considerable changes and improvements—I hope that we shall receive wide support—to ensure that leaseholders are given effective remedies this time. They have not benefited to the extent that they were promised, and we owe it to them—as we shall demonstrate in later debates—not to make the same mistake again.</span></p>

COLLECTIVE ENFRANCHISEMENT: MULTIPLE FREEHOLDERS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><ol>
<li>".—In section 3 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 (premises in respect of which the right to collective enfranchisement is exercisable), in subsection (1)(a), the words 'and the freehold of the whole of the building or of that part of the building is owned by the same person' shall be omitted.</li>

<li>Schedule [<i>Section [Collective enfranchisement: multiple freeholders]: consequential amendments</i>] (amendments consequential on this section) shall have effect.".—[<i>Mr. Clappison.</i>]</li></ol></p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, that the clause be read a Second time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take Government amendments Nos. 577 to 579.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: New clause 45 concerns the right of long leasehold owners of flats to acquire the freehold interest of the premises in which they live, which is contained in chapter 1 of part 1 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993. Section 3 of that Act specifies the premises to which the Act applies. It stipulates that for the right of enfranchisement to arise the premises must be a self-contained building or a self-contained part of a building which must be in the freehold ownership of the same person—a significant stipulation. It has become apparent that, in order to deny leaseholders that right, some freeholders have been selling-off the freehold of one or a number of flats within premises. That sale is usually to a company which they control, but it has the effect of creating more than one freehold interest in the relevant premises, and therefore the enfranchisement rights simply fail, because of the stipulation.<br><br>
The new clause and amendments will deal with this practice by allowing long leaseholders to enfranchise where one or more flying freeholds have been created, whether or not deliberately. They are extremely long and somewhat complicated, and I am sure that the Committee would not want me to go through the necessary changes line by line. Instead, I propose to confine my remarks to a simple explanation of the effects of new clause 45 and then to refer to one or two of the principal consequential amendments set out in the proposed new schedule contained in amendment No. 577.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 872</span>
In order to prevent the creation of a flying freehold from defeating an attempt at enfranchisement, the first step is to delete the reference in section 3 of the 1993 Act to the requirement that the relevant premises should be owned by the same person. This is achieved by new clause 45(1).<br><br>
That may give rise to a further difficulty. Leaseholders can purchase the freehold of a self-contained part of a building as a minimum unit of enfranchisement. Once the reference to a single person owning the freehold has been deleted, in cases where there are several self-contained parts of a building owned by different freeholders, one group of leaseholders could buy up all the freehold interests in the whole building. In effect, they could take over other parts of the building with which they had no previous connection, providing that they made up the necessary majority of qualifying leaseholders. This could mean that in a row of terraced houses converted into flats, for example, a large house could take over a smaller one within the same terrace.<br><br>
That would clearly be unacceptable, which is the reason for new clause 45(2) which provides that if a building is made up of several self-contained parts and there is more than one freehold interest within the building, the right of enfranchisement will not apply to the building as a whole. It will, however, apply to an individual self-contained part, even if there is a flying freehold within it.<br><br>
New clause 45(3) refers to additional property, which is not part of the residential premises being acquired, but which may be acquired as part of the enfranchisement process. This must be property that is demised by the lease or property which the tenant is entitled to use under the terms of the lease. For example, it could be a garden or a separate block of garages used by tenants. As presently drafted, the Act allows the freehold of such property to be acquired by the leaseholders only if it is in the same freehold ownership as the flats. There is therefore a further potential device available to the freeholder of selling off this additional property to another person. The leaseholders would not then be able to purchase it, and the enfranchisement package may look less attractive to them. New clause 45(3) would remove that potential device for frustrating enfranchisement by deleting the requirement that the additional property must be in the same freeholder ownership as the flats for it to be included.<br><br>
The proposed new schedule contained in amendment No. 577 will make consequential changes to related sections and schedules of the 1993 Act. The Committee may be pleased to hear that I will not describe them all in detail, but I should like to speak briefly to some of them.<br><br>
In the usual enfranchisement process, where there is a single freehold interest, the freeholder becomes the reversioner—the person with whom the leaseholders deal, and on whom is served all the notices. Where there are two or more freehold interests, it may be less clear who the reversioner
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0496">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 873</span>
should be. Therefore, paragraph 15 of the schedule will insert a new part IA into schedule 1 of the 1993 Act to the effect that the reversioner shall be the freeholder specified in the leaseholders' initial notice. If the freeholders then agree among themselves to a change of reversioner, he can be appointed with the agreement of the court. That will mean that once the initial notice has been served by the leaseholders, the time limits will have begun, which will reduce the scope for the freeholders to delay the enfranchisement process.<br><br>
Paragraph 18 of the schedule sets out the basis for calculating the price to be paid for the freehold and intermediate leasehold interests in a multiple freeholder case. The essential point is that the nominee purchaser acting for the tenants will pay a separate price for each of the freehold interests. Each amount will be calculated in the usual way as for any other enfranchisement purchase. Therefore, it will comprise three elements: the open market value of the freeholder's interest, the freeholder's share of any marriage value and any amount of compensation due.<br><br>
Paragraph 18 also contains detailed provisions as to how the amount payable to any intermediate leasehold interest should be calculated.<br><br>
In summary, the new clause and the related amendments deal with the flying freehold device, which has been used to attempt to frustrate the purpose of the 1993 Act and the wishes of Parliament. Therefore, it is important that the necessary steps are taken to rectify the matter and give leaseholders the right to enfranchise in such cases, both of which the new clause and the related schedule attempt to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We support the new clause because it attemps to close a loophole which allows landowners to prevent leaseholders from enfranchising simply by splitting the freehold interest. It gives me no pleasure to tell the Under-secretary that, during Committee debates on the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, we warned the Government that such a loophole would be exploited to frustrate leaseholders who sought to enfranchise. During one of those debates, I asked the Minister:
<br><blockquote><p>"Would it be possible for a freeholder to construct the freehold interests in a property or group of properties so as to frustrate the purpose of the Bill? What would happen if a landlord decided that the freehold interest was to be sub-divided into various sections to make it impossible for leaseholders to enfranchise?"</p></blockquote>
Our warnings were ignored; our amendments designed to deal with the problem were voted down by the Government, and the then Minister, the hon. Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry), assured the Committee that there would be no such loophole. He blithely claimed that
<br><blockquote><p>"It would not be in the interests of freeholders to divide freeholds to avoid enfranchisement".</p></blockquote>
He further assured us that if freeholders
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 874</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"tried to split the freehold, that would be a disposal under the existing legislation and they would automatically have to offer the leaseholders the right to purchase under the concept of first refusal."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 12 November 1992; c. 47, 49 and 50.]</p></blockquote>
The then Minister was demonstrating a touching faith in the efficacy of the right of first refusal under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987. Later today, we shall debate amendments that would close the gaping loophole in that Act.<br><br>
The truth of the matter is that neither the 1987 Act nor the 1993 Act gave leaseholders the effective rights that they were promised and that the Government rode roughshod over valid and justified warnings. They should be held responsible for all those leaseholders who have fallen foul of the loopholes. I hope that the Under-Secretary will be mindful of the Government's poor track record when we debate the Opposition amendments and amendments tabled by Conservative Members that would close loopholes which will remain even under the changes that the Government now propose. Had our warnings been heeded, many leaseholders would have been spared much anguish and disappointment, and we owe it to them to get it right this time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Ashby <span class='memberconstituency'>(North-West Leicestershire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Despite our philosophical differences, I welcome the new clause which deals with the actions of fly landlords. It might have come a little late, but we are learning from our mistakes, as one must always do. If one jumps in too quickly, one can make mistakes. I believe that we are not born with hindsight. I welcome the new clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (Mr. Ashby) for his support. I am sure that the Committee will support the new clause, as hon. Members have indicated because it deals with the potential frustration of the intention to give leaseholders the opportunity to enfranchise.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I call new clause 41, in the interests of orderly debate and proceedings in the Committee this morning, I am advising Members that I will not call any amendments to new clauses unless I am advised beforehand that the Members concerned wish to move the amendments. Therefore, if those Members catch my eye, which I am sure they will wish to do, they can indicate clearly whether they wish to move their amendment or do otherwise. Is that clearly understood?

<ul>
<li>"(4A) For the purposes of this section, where the landlord is demanding from his tenant in respect of a lease both a service charge and also a further sum or sums of payment under some other provision of the lease then, unless the tenant has otherwise indicated, any payment to the landlord shall be first appropriated to the sum or sums under the other provision of the lease.".</li></ul>
<li>, after subsection (6), add—</li>
<ul>
<li>"(6A) The landlord, on any forfeiture, shall sell the remainder of the lease on the open market, and, after deduction of the service charge, account to the former tenant for the difference.".</li></ul></ol></p>
<p>New clause 42—<i>Determination of reasonableness of service charges</i>—

<li>has been agreed or admitted by the tenant,</li>
<li>under an arbitration agreement to which the tenant is a party is to be referred to arbitration, or</li>
<li>has been the subject of determination by a court or arbitral tribunal.'.</li></ol></p>

<li>an order requiring the landlord to nominate such other insurer as is specified in the order, or</li>
<li>an order requiring him to nominate another insurer who satisfies such requirements in relation to the insurance of the dwelling as are specified in the order.</li></ol>
<li>Any such order of a leasehold valuation tribunal may, with the leave of the court, be enforced in the same way as an order of a county court to the same effect.</li>

<p>Government amendments Nos. 569,573 and 570 to 572.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee is grateful for your guidance on the matter, Mrs. Winterton. We have come to a series of long and complex new clauses. I shall set out our intentions with regard to leasehold reform; then I shall listen to the arguments advanced by those who move further amendments and respond to them in due course, if I may.<br><br>
I turn to the Government's proposals for improving the rights of leaseholders, particularly their right to challenge unreasonable service charges and bad
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0500">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 881</span>
management. That is a matter of concern throughout the Committee, and I have already stated the Government's intention to seek reform.<br><br>
Hon. Members will be familiar with the background to the subject and may have had constituency cases or seen newspaper reports about the difficulties that can arise over the management of blocks of flats. An extensive campaign in the <i>Evening Standard</i> and elsewhere last autumn drew attention to the issues, which seem to have arisen with particular intensity over recent months.<br><br>
It may assist the Committee if I describe the background and general principles. Under the leasehold system, the freeholder or landlord has the responsibility for the repair and maintenance of the property, and recovers his costs of doing so through service charges paid by individual tenants. Because there is a potential imbalance of power, Parliament has from time to time legislated to protect leaseholders from landlords who might be tempted to exploit their power.<br><br>
Last autumn, the <i>Evening Standard</i> drew attention to a new breed of landlords, who seemed to have systematically exploited the scope for levying service charges. I will not go into detail of their techniques and tactics, as I suspect that some hon. Members will have come briefed about individual cases which they will report to the Committee. The Government were convinced that some further strengthening of rights was necessary, and therefore promised to introduce the amendments that we are debating today. We believe that they are important amendments which will substantially strengthen the rights of leaseholders and give them protection from abuses such as those that have come to light. The hon. Members for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock) and for Greenwich have tabled their own alternative packages, which reveal a rather different approach and which we shall debate later.<br><br>
The Government's proposals are designed to tackle bad landlords—those who seek to exploit the system. It is appropriate to point out that such bad landlords are a minority. Many landlords are good, of course, but the minority of bad landlords can cause problems for leaseholders. We have proposed new rights that will limit landlords' recourse to forfeiture; provide easier means of challenging unreasonable service charges; enlarge the grounds for going to court; allow a manager to be appointed when there is proven bad management; and allow surveyors appointed by tenants associations better rights of access to landlords' records relating to specification and buildings.<br><br>
We do not want to impose new obligations and duties on the good landlords—the majority—who act honourably. To do so would only make their job more difficult and would mean ultimately that leaseholders would have to pay more for property management. We are determined to deal with the problems that have been caused by bad landlords. I shall now give details on the substance of the Government's amendments.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 882</span>
11 am<br><br>
First, in future, landlords will not be able to use forfeiture as the first means of enforcing payment of a service charge. Unless the leaseholder agrees that the service charge is due, the landlord will first have to establish that the sum is lawfully due. It will mean that any disputes about service charges will have to be resolved before, rather than after, forfeiture proceedings are initiated. That is a matter to which the hon. Member for Greenwich adverted in our previous sitting. It is quite something for leaseholders to be faced with the prospect of forfeiture.<br><br>
Secondly, we have provided more extensive rights for leaseholders to challenge unreasonable service charges. Leaseholders will be able to challenge proposals before work starts, and landlords will be able to obtain rulings, if they wish, so that they can be sure about the reasonableness. We have given a jurisdiction to leasehold valuation tribunals to make rulings on the application either of a leaseholder or of a landlord either before or after works have been carried out. The Committee will be interested to hear that leasehold valuation tribunals are less formal than court proceedings and, importantly, costs are not awarded. That will make it much more practicable for leaseholders or groups of leaseholders to exercise their right of challenge. We have amplified the ground on which leaseholders may apply to the court for the appointment of a manager. Evidence of excessive charges or unnecessary work will provide grounds for an application.<br><br>
Finally, we have provided that tenants associations may appoint a surveyor who will have a statutory right to see landlords' records relating to service charge expenditure, and the associations will have the right to inspect the common parts of buildings. That could be important, for example, in helping to gather the evidence to challenge a service charge, or to prove a case of bad management. Even when the manager is behaving responsibly, leaseholders may gain some comfort from knowing that there is somebody keeping an eye on service charge spending and ensuring that the landlord is keeping up to the mark.<br><br>
That announces a comprehensive new package of rights that builds on and extends important rights that leaseholders already have.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I make it clear that I wish to move all the amendments that stand in my name in due course? But I welcome the amendments to new clauses 41 and 42 in so far as there is a philosophical difference between the Government and myself. The amendments will do a great deal to help the tenant. They will ensure that his situation is taken into account more fully and will give him greater rights, so I make it absolutely clear that I welcome the new clauses.<br><br>
However, one thing concerns me about the Bill and other legislation that we have enacted. The law is complicated and difficult for a tenant to deal with. Tenants will require a great deal of advice, and a great deal of legal advice. It would be so much easier if we made certain situations clear to tenants through our
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0501">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 883</span>
legislation, rather than requiring them to find out about it from individual court judgments. Landlords do not read them, tenants do not know about them and even lawyers do not always know. One goes to a tribunal and the chairman says, "Wasn't there a judgment some time?" and one takes an enormous amount of trouble for a lot of heartache.<br><br>
We cannot underestimate the effect that litigation has on people. I have been through litigation. It killed two years of my life and it is still killing my life. I have spoken to people who are involved in other areas of litigation and have found that it becomes overwhelming. We should be here to simplify life and make the law clear.<br><br>
The new clause is designed to deal with bad landlords. My first amendment to new clause 41 and some of my amendments to new clause 42 deal with landlords who are making a tremendous amount of money out of holding freeholds. Landlords may have long leaseholds of 99 years all of which have 50 or 60 years to run. In my case, and I hope I have declared my interest sufficiently, I have a 999 year lease that has 960 to run.<br><br>
Let me tell the Committee my experience. My landlord will not give up the freehold. I have made a magnificent offer; I pay £15 a year ground rent and, in company terms, one would normally use a multiplier of seven or eight, but I have offered a magnificent multiplier of 10. I have offered £150, as have all four of us in my small block of purpose-built flats. We feel that that is a proper multiplier.<br><br>
The landlord will not have that. Why not? There is a clause in the lease that says that the landlord shall nominate the insurance company. That is fair enough. It is a good idea to have one insurance company covering the block, because a fire in one flat would probably damage others.<br><br>
But I wonder why I am paying twice as much for my insurance as any quote I have had. That strikes me as extraordinary. I contacted the insurance company and said, "What's the commission that the landlord is earning on that insurance?" But the company said, "We cannot disuss that". I said, "I am paying the insurance, so you must tell me the commission or I am not going to pay". "We will not tell you," said the insurance company.<br><br>
Well, I decided that it was costing me at least 15 per cent., so I deducted that and sent them the balance. I got my cheque back by return of post. "We will not accept a cheque from you," the company said. "It has to come through your landlords," who happen to be insurance brokers.<br><br>
Then, I made further inquiries of my landlord, asking what commission was being earned. "We won't tell you," said they. "You are not entitled to know." I said, "Well, I am not going to pay until you tell me what commission you are earning." We toed and froed until they threatened forfeiture and I paid because it was not worth that for only £340 or so. I was in the middle of a scam.<br><br>
When I had paid, they told me that they were earning 17 per cent. I said, "My contract with you
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 884</span>
specifies only that you shall nominate the insurance company, not that you should effect the insurance and take 17 per cent." There is a great scam taking place between my landlord and the insurance company. They are in it together and he has a fantastic interest in my insurance being twice as expensive as anyone else's because 17 per cent. of £340 is a good deal more than 17 per cent. of £180—which was another quotation that I received. The landlord is doing mightily well.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will say that the problem is being dealt with through changes that allow one to appoint one's own people to manage. Blow me, Mrs. Winterton, why should I have to go through the courts and get managers and all sorts of other people appointed, when there is such a simple way of doing it? My amendments go straight to that point. Amendment (a) to new clause 41 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The landlord shall account to the tenant for any commission earned in respect of the service charge other than what could constitute reasonable administrative charge."</p></blockquote>
I do not want the landlord to have to pay for his own postage or for the cost of the letter, which is £5. I am quite willing to pay for my insurance, plus £5 plus 25p to know what the premium will be for the year, but I do not expect to pay for the landlord's commission.<br><br>
It is not just insurance. Last night, I was speaking to a Member of Parliament—who is in the Room at this very moment—who told me about scams, such as landlords who say that they have to appoint a surveyor to consider the painting of the property. Whose surveyor? The landlord's of course. Who pays for the surveyor who is being employed at a vast sum that one cannot deduct or query? The poor tenant.<br><br>
What is a landlord of a block of flats who is in on the scam and wants to make a lot of money likely to do? He will appoint contractors and have his own company to do all the work. What will he charge the tenants for service? He will be very reasonable and charge the cost of the painting plus 15 or 17 per cent. That is the normal mark-up in the building trade, as he has discovered, and he is prepared to go to the top end as the charge cannot be queried. He is onto a good thing. He then says that he has to administer the process, and adds an administration charge of 15 per cent.—very reasonable. That makes a 30 per cent. mark-up on the service charge.<br><br>
What do we find in new clause 41? I am pleased to see that the service charge will be fought for first, but what about the tenant who has put his life savings into a long lease and has been subject to the recession, not getting the wage increases that he could have expected? He is faced with a magnificent service charge, amounting to £3,000—£1,000 of which is commission and interest. He looks at his bank balance and sees that he has £1,500, and he can borrow another £500. But he cannot afford the great big profit that the landlord can at the moment legitimately take. What is he to do? Can he afford to fight the landlord using new clause 42, knowing that he will not get his costs back? I have also tabled amendments to deal with that problem.<br><br>
The tenant will have a great big battle that will cost him another £1,000. Perhaps he has gone in with all
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0502">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 885</span>
the other tenants, who have all agreed to put in £500. He is still in despair. He goes to his bank and says, "I've got to borrow, because I've paid £84,000 for a long lease. I have a mortgage of £60,000 there and I've already paid the balance. I shall forfeit an awful lot if I do not pay my service charges. The landlord is being exertive because he is properly charging the other parties and making a great big whack out of it but there is nothing that I can do." What do we say to him? He may be sitting in the Gallery and may say, "Mr. Ashby, you are speaking from the heart about precisely the problems that I have."<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
I do not want to do the landlord out of his interest, but what is his interest? It should not be in services charges. It is in his property and the fact that he has a long lease that is subject to a ground rent. I beg my hon. Friend the Minister and everyone else to keep their eye on the ball in this respect. That is the landlord's interest, and everything else is superfluous. I am not sure that I have the wording right, but I hope that the Minister will be able to accept my amendment. I trust that the word "commission" covers profits as well. I hope that my hon. Friend will agree that the landlord is not entitled to profit from this aspect. He is entitled to charge administrative charges. That is fair enough, provided that they are reasonable. But he is not allowed to make profit from the freehold. He is using his contract, and abusing his position. My amendment (a) to new clause 41 covers the problem. I urge the Minister to look at it.<br><br>
What about the poor chap who has to forfeit his lease because he cannot afford the service charge? The landlord gets a substantial advantage out of it, but he should not. Amendment (c) to new clause 41 covers this: it provides that a lease must be sold on at the market rent and accounted for to the tenant. I cannot see anything wrong with either amendment—they are part of our Government's philosophy—or why the Minister should not accept them. They are entirely in keeping with Conservative philosophy, the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1933 and the 1987 Act, and they improve and tighten them. I do not accept that we should go 10 or five years down the line to another housing Bill when my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison), the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, will be Minister of State, if not in the Cabinet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Hanson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Shadow Cabinet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, the Cabinet. I disagree with many of the things that Opposition Members say, and that is one. By that time, my hon. Friend, who will probably be a Cabinet Minister, will say that we have learnt a lesson. I agree that we must go step by step, but I have spoken about this and I do not want to go down that road. I beg my hon. Friend to accept my amendment.<br><br>
On new clause 42, I shall comment later on the way in which I think we should approach the freehold
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 886</span>
issue, so I shall confine myself for the time being to amendments (d), (e), (f) and (g), which I wish to move. I hope, Mrs. Winterton, that I am in order speaking to these amendments. I was not sure, but I have received your note. I hope that I moved correctly the previous two amendments on new clause 41.<br><br>
I have carried through in these amendments precisely the philosophy that I described in respect of new clause 41. My amendment (d) would insert before subsection (2) of new clause 42:
<br><blockquote><p>"(2D) On the consideration of any application by a leasehold valuation tribunal, the tribunal shall disregard all commission which the landord purports to earn other than that which may cover reasonable administrative costs."</p></blockquote>
Amendment (e) would insert in line 38:
<br><blockquote><p>"(3A) The tribunal shall exclude any commission earned by the landlord in respect of any insurance.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(3B) The landlord shall account to the tenant for any commission earned on a contract for insurance."</p></blockquote>
I want to make that perfectly clear and I say that fervently after my own experience. I have the greatest interest in that. I delare it time and again, but I believe that I am right to bring my experiences to the Committee. They cover the experiences of three other people in my block of flats and of hundreds of people up and down the country.<br><br>
The problem that we have is that it is not generally recognised that in some instances these commissions can be and are excluded. The Committee must agree that landlords are not entitled to profit from their position in an improper way. Where there are service charges and work to be done it should go out to tender. The lowest tender must be taken. The work obviously has to be done and that has to be administered. No one doubts that that it the proper thing. But it is wrong for landlords to profit and those two amendments make that absolutely clear.<br><br>
My amendments (f) and (g) to new clause 42 may be a bit ham-handed, but they deal with a fundamental problem that tenants have. Most tenants have very little knowledge of the law and where to go in the first place. But they have to seek advice which is extremely costly. The view that that would be simplified by not allowing costs or by allowing costs to the landlord alone in some cases as is proposed in the Bill is fundamentally flawed. Costs should follow the event in every case. The tenant's reasonable costs where the landlord has acted unreasonably should always be allowed. The tenant should not have to pay for the advice that he has to seek in order to defeat the bad landlord.<br><br>
The good landlord is not a problem. He will come and speak to the tenants and tell them there is a problem and that this and that needs to be done. He may say, "I suggest this surveyor but if you know another good surveyor who is cheaper let us use him." The good landlord would talk to the tenants and see that there was common agreement about what had to be done.<br><br>
The bad landlord, however, looks at every misery and difficulty as an opportunity to make a profit. Anyone who has to take his landlord to a valuation court and a Lands Tribunal is not dealing with a good
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0503">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 887</span>
landlord but a bad landlord. One could almost say that their is a presumption that the tenant should be expected to get reasonable costs. It should be within the power of the adjudicating body to see that the tenant's reasonable costs are taken into account.<br><br>
On the subject of enfranchisement, I had to seek the advice of a surveyor, but my landlord has managed to delay everything by saying that he wants his own surveyor, who could say only "this is a 950-year lease at £15 a year." However, my landlord wants his own man; he insists that I pay the cost and he seems to have the power to do that. That is an example of the attitude of bad landlords.<br><br>
Freeholds have been bought up right, left and centre by people who have seen loopholes and opportunities to profit from tenants. There have always been bad landlords, but they often just sat and did nothing. But in the past 10 or 15 years, they have realised that they can do something positive, with a vengeance, and make a nice bit of money out of the tenants. That is improper; it is a scam. I beg, and expect, the Minister to accept my amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Diana Maddock <span class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with much of what the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire said. Previous housing legislation has resulted in all sorts of problems that have been, and will continue to be, widely publicised in the Committee and outside the House.<br><br>
Service charges for leaseholders have caused more problems to more people than many other aspects of the legislation. As the law stands, a clever landlord can exploit others for his own ends. We want to ensure that people do not have to go to court because the Bill will make matters clearer and therefore easier to resolve.<br><br>
I am happy to speak to my series of amendments in this part of the Bill now, if that would make the proceedings easier, Mrs. Winterton. I notice that you are nodding, so I shall continue.<br><br>
My first amendment relates to tenants who owe their landlords service charges and other debts. As hon. Members who are lawyers know, the problem is that in the case of someone who owes money on two separate items, the recipient can choose to which claim any payment is allocated, unless that is stated.<br><br>
Landlords who are knowledgeable and well-advised, which, as we have heard in Committee, many are, will be able to avoid the terms of the clause by appropriating the entire payment to the service charge and none to the ground rent, for example. The ground rent will therefore be unpaid and a landlord could issue forfeiture proceedings. The amendment is designed to show the Government the problems that are likely as a result of the clause. The wording is not perfect, but I hope that the Minister will consider the possibility that what I outlined might occur, and ensure that he carefully considers what is in the clause.<br><br>
On new clause 42, again I seek clarification. The proposal outlines rules for taking a landlord to a leasehold valuation tribunal, which I welcome. But it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 888</span>
excludes cases about which a court has already ruled, and instances where matters have
<br><blockquote><p>"been agreed or admitted by the tenant".</p></blockquote>
That is unsatisfactory. How is an agreement or an admission defined? A landlord's word would not be adequate. Tenants who take a landlord to a leasehold valuation tribunal challenge the service charge, and would, therefore, deny any agreement. We need clarification about what constitutes an agreement or an admission.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
There may be cases in which a tenant claims that he signed under duress, or was misled about what he was signing. I am advised by lawyers that such a case could be a legal minefield. I hope that the Minister will consider that, and ensure that the provisions are adequate. Amendments (a) and (b) to new clause 42 are similar, but they apply to different subsections of the new clause. Amendment (b) is based on the same principle as amendment (a); therefore, I shall say no more about amendment (b).<br><br>
New clause 42 describes in detail the new responsibilities of leasehold valuation tribunals. Its purpose is to make it easier for tenants legally to challenge service charges by reducing bureaucracy and costs through providing alternatives to the courts. I welcome that. However, lines 46 to 48 state:
<br><blockquote><p>"Any such order to a leasehold valuation tribunal may, with the leave of the court, be enforced in the same way as an order of a county court to the same effect."</p></blockquote>
They undermine the new clause's aim in two ways. First, they require decisions to go to a court. I accept that ratification would take far less court time than a full hearing, but it is unusual for tribunal decisions to be required to go to court.<br><br>
Secondly, the use of the word "may" rather than "shall" means that the court has the option of rejecting the decision, although the procedure for that is not set out. Surely a court would not be able to decide not to ratify a decision without going through the evidence again. That would undermine the new clause. I hope that the Minister will re-examine the provision, and perhaps take more legal advice. I am simply trying to obtain clarification and identify potential problems.<br><br>
Amendment (a) to new clause 44 is fairly simple. It deals with qualified surveyors. The new clause provides that qualified surveyors can act for tenants. Some people are not happy about that because using a qualified surveyor will incur costs. In a block of flats, one of the tenants might be a qualified surveyor. Could such a person act as a qualified surveyor for the purposes of new clause 44? It would save tenants a lot of money in fees.<br><br>
New clause 64 deals with setting management costs. I do not pretend that it is perfect. I have tabled it to highlight the problem of giving tenants some teeth against unreasonable landlords who hike up costs. I am happy for the Government to set other figures, but it is important to place a limit on management costs. The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire spoke about about tenants' problems with landlords who were involved in insurance scams.

It is difficult for tenants to fight against landlords. Many Conservative Members do not support regulation, but if we can put into the Bill provisions to put the law on the side of the little people—the people who find it hard to fight the big boys—we shall have done a lot. A great deal has happened since the last time the Government considered legislating on the issue. If the matters that I am concerned about had been taken into account on that occasion, we should not be in the mess that we are in.<br><br>
I do not have much personal experience of the matter that we are dealing with, but I do know of some elderly constituents of mine, who live in a sheltered private scheme. They took the decision to live there because they thought that somebody would look after them as they got older. Nothing could have been further from the truth. Many such people are in their 80s. Trying to get together to fight a landlord is difficult. Anything that can be included in the Bill to stop such problems is important. That is the reasoning behind new clause 64. It is not perfect. Like other hon. Members, I am grateful for the advice and knowledge that have been passed on to me by Joan South. I know that her organisation is concerned about the topic and would welcome a limit specified in the Bill. I hope that the Minister will take the new clause in that spirit. I look forward to his assistance. If he gave it, he would do an awful lot for a great many people and—although I do not know who will be in the Government in future—he might not have to put up with people coming to tell him, "I told you so". I think that that possibility was the main tenor of the remarks of the hon. Member for Greenwich.<br><br>
If the Minister is not willing to accept the new clause, I hope that he will deal with the matter in some other way, or reassure me on the matters that I have raised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cirencester and Tewkesbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that we are intended to deal with new clauses 41 and 42 together, which means that my speech will be a little longer than it would have been if they had been considered separately.<br><br>
The new clauses are intended to deal with a small number of rogue landlords who have been mentioned in Committee. An <i>Evening Standard</i> campaign has highlighted their activities. Broadly speaking, responsible landlords will welcome new clause 41, which is entitled:
<br><blockquote><p>"Restriction on termination of tenancy for failure to pay service charges"</p></blockquote>
and new clause 42, which is entitled:
<br><blockquote><p>"Determination of reasonableness of service charge".</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the Government could examine one or two technical difficulties that I have identified in the new clauses, to ascertain whether they cover all practical difficulties. New clause 41 is intended to prevent a court from making an order for possession following the service of forfeiture proceedings by the landlord for service charge arrears until the amount of the service charge has either been agreed or admitted by the tenant or has been subject to a determination by a leasehold valuation tribunal.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 890</span>
Subsection (1) of new clause 41 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"A landlord may not … exercise a right of re-entry or forfeiture for failure to pay a service charge".</p></blockquote>
That might be an incorrect interpretation of the law. The right to forfeiture is exercised following the issue and service of forfeiture proceedings. Moreover, an anomaly arises between the provision that I have quoted and the proposal that disputed forfeiture proceedings may be referred to a leasehold valuation tribunal. However, altering the wording to commence—and this is just a suggestion—
<br><blockquote><p>"No order for possession may be made following forfeiture proceedings"</p></blockquote>
would avoid technical difficulty, consistently with the policy behind the new clause, and provide greater clarity.<br><br>
Subsection (1)(a) of new clause 41 provides that a landlord would be able to pursue forfeiture proceedings if the amount of the service charge had been
<br><blockquote><p>"agreed or admitted by the tenant".</p></blockquote>
However, there is no stipulation as to how the tenant might signal his agreement or admission. Presumably, if the tenant did not respond, or the response was ambiguous, that could not be taken as agreement or admission. More fundamentally, what would happen if there were a recognised tenants association, which the landlord had closely consulted and with which he had negotiated? Should a tenant benefit from the leasehold valuation tribunal procedure when the scope and cost of the work had already been agreed between the landlord and tenants association? The Minister's comments on that would be greatly appreciated.<br><br>
There are one of two problems with new clause 42 that I should like to discuss. The new clause would amend the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 to give power to a leasehold valuation tribunal to determine the reasonableness of service charges. It would give both tenants and landlords the right to apply to the LVT, either before or after costs have been incurred, for a determination of the reasonableness of a service charge.<br><br>
A number of issues arise from the new clause, and it would be helpful to hear the Minister's comments on them. The new clause is silent on the consequences of a determination by the LVT. Is that an oversight? Presumably, it is intended that a determination, particularly under section 19(2B) should be binding on both landlords and tenants.<br><br>
In addition, the question of variations is not covered by the clause. Quite often, when a landlord starts work on a property, he discovers in the course of the original work that further work is necessary. For example, dry rot may be discovered which could not possibly have been detected when the original schedule of works was drawn up. In those circumstances, it is intended that a landlord will have to refer back to the LVT for a further determination as to the scope and costs of the new work that has been discovered and is deemed necessary. If so, surely a single building surveyor sitting as an LVT could deal swiftly with variations. However, a three-person tribunal—the word "tribunal" implies three—is the norm and that may be less flexible and more costly.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0505">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 891</span>
Moreover, will it be possible for the LVT to receive written submissions?<br><br>
It is surely reasonable that responsible landlords should be no worse off as a consequnce of the measures that the Government have had to consider because of the activities of a very small number of unscrupulous landlords. New clause 42 would give landlords no right to recover costs involved in the legitimate recovery of service charges through LVTs following an award. Previously in forfeiture proceedings, the court would have been able to make an award for costs. Under the new clause, tenants—who may not pay their service charges for no better reason than a disinclination—might spuriously invoke the LVT procedure. The landlord would incur costs in defending the action, but would not be able to recover them. It is right that a landlord who has acted reasonably should be able to recover such costs incurred. If the court retains a power to award costs, spurious service charge disputes will be prevented and only those tenants who have a serious and genuine grievance will proceed to the LVT. I should welcome the Minister's comments on that.<br><br>
Section 31A(2) of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 allows a court to transfer disputes over service charges to an LVT for determination. The new clause is intended to provide a less costly mechanism for determining service charge disputes, and, as I said, that is warmly welcomed by responsible landlords. However, service charge disputes often concern a small proportion of the amount of the charge. For example, a landlord may issue a service charge bill of £1,000 for all legitimate aspects of that charge, but in cold weather over the Christmas period the central boiler for his block of flats may break down. In that case, a tenant may want to withhold £150 from his bill of £1,000 because of the extra electricity costs incurred by using electric fires when there was no central heating. Would it be reasonable for that tenant to withhold the entire £1,000 for the sake of just the £150 in dispute?<br><br>
In such circumstances, it is reasonable that a court, before transferring a service charge dispute to the LVT, should have the discretion to require the tenant to pay to the landlord the undisputed part of the charge. In the example I gave, £850 would be paid before the case went to the LVT. That would have the advantage of deterring spurious service charge disputes, and easing landlords' fear that the procedure will be used for spurious disputes simply to delay the payment of a service charge. Again, the Minister's view on that would be warmly welcomed.<br><br>
If the Minister is unable to express a view on those technical matters today, I should be grateful if he would consider them carefully before Report stage, as they are the result of serious consideration by the property industry.</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I propose to speak only to new clause 41 and new clause 81, which relates closely to it, and the relevant amendments. I hope, Mrs. Winterton, that you will be kind and allow me to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 892</span>
return to other matters relating to new clause 42 and other new clauses as the debate develops.<br><br>
The Minister concentrated on new clause 41 in opening the debate, and there are so many other detailed issues that we will need to cover in relation to other new clauses that it would be helpful if we could proceed in that way.<br><br>
We support in principle new clause 41, but believe that it should go further, which is why we have tabled new clause 81. It may help the Committee if I explain briefly the three differences between new clauses 41 and 81, which are identical in other respects. We have adopted the wording of new clause 41 and propose to amend it in three significant ways.<br><br>
The first is to extend the definition of service charges to cover all charges other than ground rent. That may not be necessary. The wording of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 rightly takes a broad definition of service charges. Section 18 defines service charges as
<br><blockquote><p>"an amount payable … in addition to the rent … which is payable, directly or indirectly, for services, repairs, maintenance or insurance or the landlord's costs of management."</p></blockquote>
That is a broad definition which should cover most eventualities. However, we have learnt about the ability of large landowners and others to find loopholes, so it seemed wise to take an even more wide-ranging definition of service charges to cover every charge except for ground rent. If an ingenious landlord manages to devise, under some curious form of covenant, a means of charging a leaseholder a charge which would not fall within the existing definition of service charge, but which is not part of the ground rent, that would fall within the proposed definition. That is the purpose of the first change.<br><br>
The second change is designed to give powers to the Secretary of State, and I should have thought that the Minister would welcome that. It will allow the Secretary of State to prescribe by regulations the content of the information to be given to tenants under the provisions of the legislation. There is a simple reason for that change. Although legislation may contain requirements for landlords to provide information, often they are not complied with in the spirit of the legislation. Indeed, they are often treated with contempt.<br><br>
As evidence of that, I shall quote to the Minister a report on the working of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987, commissioned and published by the Department of the Environment. The report was carried out by Social and Community Planning Research and was completed in May 1991. The report referred to the comments of a solicitor on the 1987 Act, who said:
<br><blockquote><p>"There is no statutory form of notice, and there is no plain English form of notice so we just trot out what is in the section. You need to wrap a cold towel round your head to understand it and any tenant receiving it would not know what was going on … if anybody needed a standard form or a prescripted form, we need one for Section 18 … there are commercial forms available, all they do really is they follow the Act and they're incomprehensible".</p></blockquote>
There we have a solicitor commenting on how those acting in the landlord's interests simply comply with the letter of the law, but completely destroy its
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0506">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 893</span>
purpose by not presenting information in a coherent and accessible way. That is why we propose that there should be guidance from the Secretary of State on the way in which the information is presented.<br><br>
The third change that we want to make is to include reference to leasehold valuation tribunals in the new clause. The Government refer to a matter which
<br><blockquote><p>"has been the subject of determination by a court or by an arbitral tribunal",</p></blockquote>
but do not mention leasehold valuation tribunals which, of course, will be involved. That is an omission. Our change is helpful and would make the Bill more logical and correct.<br><br>
I have outlined the purposes behind new clause 81, which we regard as preferable to new clause 41, and we hope that the Minister will accept it. We shall not press it to a vote, because doing so would make it impossible to support amendments to new clause 41. We will be supporting amendments (a) and (c), which have been tabled by the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire. Amendment (a) requires a landlord to account for commission earned on insurance. The hon. Gentleman has made a sound case as to why there should be disclosure of such commission. Let me add to it.<br><br>
I refer to a brochure which is currently being circulated by an organisation called The Ground Rent Brokers, which claims to be the leading brokerage for ground rents in the United Kingdom. It states that, as a result of its work,
<br><blockquote><p>"an increasing number of our clients, large and small, coordinated by ourselves, are joining together to maximise their buying power for insurance purposes. Their total premium payments to an old established insurance broker are very large indeed and growing.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>This is generating increasing advantages in which all participants share".</p></blockquote>
When we get to the fine print, we will see that it is only The Ground Rent Brokers, the insurance company and the freeholders who share. The leaseholders do not share—they pay—but The Ground Rent Brokers claim that all participants share.<br><br>
The brochure goes on to state that The Ground Rent Brokers are offering
<br><blockquote><p>"Custom built policies for freeholders and property managers issued by a leading UK insurance company, a total administration service at no extra cost, rapid settlement of claims, credit facilities, immediate cover for new risks, all documentation issued at premium level paid by tenant and"—</p></blockquote>
in bold type—
<br><blockquote><p>"exceptionally high commissions to freeholders and property managers".</p></blockquote>
The brochure states in another, italicised section:
<br><blockquote><p>"We guarantee that the increase in your income will be substantial."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire understated his case. Those are disgraceful scams which are being perpetrated at the expense of leaseholders all over the country by people who, frankly, are sharks. They are making great deals of money for freeholders and for themselves off the backs of the leaseholders, who have no choice but to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 894</span>
pay the demand for insurance which those people create. They are deliberately forcing the price up. It is a scam and we must stop it. That it why we strongly support the hon. Gentleman's amendments.<br><br>
The perpetrators have also been in touch with members of the Committee in a different context. I have received many letters—I suspect that other hon. Members have too—from people claiming to be responsible agents and landlords who are appalled that we are interfering with their right of contract and that we would in any way prevent them from pursuing service and other charges through the threat of forfeiture.<br><br>
One of those people is Mr. Richard Irving from The Ground Rent Brokers. He writes:
<br><blockquote><p>"This company specialises in the sale of reversionary interests. A substantial number of our clients large and small have expressed concern over the proposal that Section 146 (forfeiture) notices be removed from all service charge debt recovery proceedings. … It is requested that you reconsider the proposal to totally remove the sanction of forfeiture proceedings on all arrears of maintenance. … To protect all tenants in a building from an unreasonable Landlord or one or a few unreasonable tenants it is suggested that forfeiture proceedings still remain for annual service charge payments, insurance premiums, minor repairs, cleaning etc. up to a level of say £1,000 or £2,000. Otherwise there is a substantial probability of lessees losing faith in the efficacy of the proposed changes."</p></blockquote>
Mr. Irving is clearly concerned that there will be a loss in his earnings and in those of some of the freeholders who benefit from his nefarious activities. I hope that that disclosure will enable the Committee to treat the representations that we have received from many people of the like of Mr. Irving with the contempt that they deserve.<br><br>
The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire attacks the issue by requiring disclosure. That is right. There is no case for concealment. We support the hon. Gentleman and hope that he will press the amendment to a vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall begin on this complex group of new clauses and amendments by dealing with the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire. I listened to him with great interest. He spoke with great passion and assisted the Committee with the benefit of some of his experiences.<br><br>
I agree with what my hon. Friend said about litigation, which always weighs heavily on the minds of those involved in it. The Committee has been considering tenants faced with litigation, and I invite my hon. Friend to consider that much of what the Government are proposing will assist tenants in that position. My hon. Friend will be aware that tenants are concerned not only about litigation but about its consequences. I hope that he will welcome our separation of service charges from forfeiture so that forfeiture is not the first result of a dispute.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend recognise that my amendment covers what happens after forfeiture and after a tenant has failed to pay a service charge? I envisage that it would apply only where a tenant was not able to pay a service charge. Why should a lease be entirely forfeit? Why should not the landlord
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0507">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 895</span>
recover just his service charge and, as with any mortgage, account to the owner for the balance of the property?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that. We have agreed that that is a separate point from how the litigation appears to the tenant in the first place when he receives a forfeiture notice as a result of a service charges dispute. It is at that stage that a tenant is confronted with serious consequences.<br><br>
I shall deal in more detail later with my hon. Friend's other amendments, and with the situation that he has just outlined, but first, I shall deal with his point about insurance commissions. My hon. Friend's suggestions would mean that a landlord would have to pass on to his tenants any commissions earned as part of a service charge. A leasehold valuation tribunal considering a service charge dispute would have to disregard any commissions earned by the landlord. But the landlord is ultimately responsible for satisfactory upkeep of the property. It is therefore reasonable that he should choose the insurer. I cannot accept that he should be deprived of that, so I cannot accept my hon. Friend's amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest respect, my hon. Friend has not been properly instructed by his officials. Lands tribunals make decisions that exclude commission or say that it must be excluded from valuations. I am trying to spell that out in legislation. The Government's failure to accept my amendment means that they are not accepting existing legal decisions which I want to put into law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is on a different point. He made his point very forcefully about insurance commissions, but if we are to spell out every relationship between landlords and tenants in legislation, we shall have to go into great detail. I have to be concerned about the practicality of the course that my hon. Friend recommends. He referred to the existing position of lands tribunals. I accept that insurance cover on properties can sometimes be high, and I invite my hon. Friend to consider carefully the remedies, which currently exist and which will exist as a result of the Bill, for tenants who find themselves in such a position. We have included in our new proposals a provision for leasehold valuation tribunals to examine insurance of a property as part of considering what is reasonable for service charge payments.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
What most leaseholders are concerned about on insurance is that their premiums are too high. Under existing legislation—with which my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Greenwich are no doubt familiar—leaseholders already have the right to challenge a landlord's choice of insurer on the grounds either that the cover is unsatisfactory in some way or that the premiums that they pay are excessive.<br><br>
Leaseholders also have the right to a summary of insurance cover, to inspect the policy and to take
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 896</span>
copies of it. That provides the information that leaseholders would need to know if they want to challenge the insurance of their property.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to understand what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary proposes, as I so desperately want to support the Government as far as I can. Will he state categorically that a landlord is entitled to a commission on the services, in addition to the administrative charge that he makes? I should like that to be spelt out, as that is what he seems to be saying.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can be of some assistance to my hon. Friend in his desperation. I am saying that we have given tenant leaseholders the right to challenge insurance charges and service charges—my hon. Friend has already referred to that—and we want to take that further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether it would help my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire if I refer him to new clause 42(2), which will amend paragraph 8 of the schedule to the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 as follows:
<br><blockquote><p>"(2) The tenant or landlord may apply to a county court or leasehold valuation tribunal for a determination whether—
<ol>
<li>the insurance which is available from the nominated insurer for insuring the tenant's dwelling is unsatisfactory in any respect, or</li>
<li>the premiums payable in respect of any such insurance are excessive."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
In other words, if a tenant, in circumstances such as my hon. Friend described, believes that the commission earned is unsatisfactory, he will be able to refer the matter to the LVT, which will be able to take a view on whether the charge is excessive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That illustrates the point that I was making, and I invite my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire to consider existing provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Under-Secretary reflect on what was just said? The hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Clifton-Brown), who was trying to help the Under-Secretary, quoted from the new clause, which did not mention the word "commission". Will the Under-Secretary accept that premiums are not commissions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury and which the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) should take on board, was that the provision about what can be challenged in the courts is wide, and will be of assistance to tenants. Tenants have strong feelings on the matter, and the reforms build on existing measures to give tenants the right to have courts determine on reasonableness.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend saying that I would be able to take the matter to the tribunal and say not only that I have found a premium for £ 180 rather than £380, for example—the policies cover the same points, so it would be unreasonable to have to pay the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0508">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 897</span>
£380 premium—but that the commission on the £180 policy is also unreasonable? If so, why will he not spell it out? If not, will he please spell it out, so that we understand? Will he please relate his explanation to those matters that I mentioned, such as surveyors?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the provisions speak for themselves. They will give tenants the right to challenge unreasonable charges, which is what my hon. Friend is concerned about. The courts will be able to consider such matters under the powers that they will have to determine reasonableness.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary will know from what we have already said that we are dealing with this proposed legislation because previous attempts in 1985, 1987 and 1993 failed and left loopholes. Does he not recognise that the issue of commission is an absolutely glaring loophole which the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire has highlighted? We have shown how it is being exploited by freeholders to earn a lot of money. Exceptionally high commissions are paid and freeholders are told, "We guarantee the increase in your income will be substantial." That money is taken from leaseholders and, unless the Under-Secretary can give a clear answer that commission will be covered, he has no basis for rejecting the amendment tabled by his hon. Friend the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the hon. Member for Greenwich, I think that he is painting with his broad brush again. We are giving tenants the right to challenge unreasonably high premiums. That is the important point. If a landlord tries to rip off a tenant with an unreasonably high premium the matter can be taken to court and determined under the provisions in new clause 42. It will give protection to tenants and I am sure that the hon. Member for Greenwich would not want to mislead the Committee by suggesting anything other than that it will assist tenants who want to challenge excessive premiums being charged by landlords. My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire will have the benefit of those provisions, as will every other tenant.<br><br>
Amendment (c) relates to the fate of the lease following forfeiture. I can sympathise with the reasoning behind the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend. He has painted a customary vivid picture of unscrupulous landlords extorting service charges from intimidated leaseholders until the breaking point is reached and the lease is forfeited. The landlord then walks off with the remaining equity in the flat, leaving the leaseholder homeless and still possibly owing a large sum of money to his mortgage lender.<br><br>
Even in today's climate—my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire may be familiar with this—there are very few completed forfeitures. I have already explained how new clause 41 will separate forfeiture frorm service charge disputes. Leaseholders will still retain their ability to apply to the court for relief from forfeiture, which is very often granted, as my hon. Friend will know from his experience in these
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 898</span>
matters. However, if the writing is on the wall, the lease can always be sold.<br><br>
Under the new system, forfeitures will be very rare and are likely to be deserved. I remind the Committee that there can be bad tenants as well as bad landlords.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary is saying and I sympathise with much of it, but I do not understand the word "deserved". Surely he means penalised. Does he mean that that word should be substituted and that bad tenants or those who cannot pay should be penalised? My hon. Friend should be honest about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can assist my hon. Friend. I know that he has strong feelings on this subject. He will be familiar with the general proposition that it is possible to have bad tenants as well as bad landlords. He will know that tenants who do not comply with the covenants and conditions of their lease may find themselves facing forfeiture. Earlier in our proceedings, we discussed some of the situations that can arise. When a tenant's conduct or failure has been such that the question of forfeiture arises under section 146 of the Law of Property Act 1925, with an appropriate notice served, the word "deserved" is not too strong. If a tenant has tried to take advantage in some way, he should forfeit the lease. I understand my hon. Friend's point, but if he reflects on it, he will accept, in the fair way in which he approaches these matters, that it is possible to have bad tenants as well as bad landlords.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to highlight a problem that is being experienced increasingly in my constituency where leaseholders are outliving the financial resources they have available to maintain their lives. Year on year, service charges rise way above people's ability to pay for them. The Under-Secretary's point that they could get themselves out of that situation by selling the lease is irrelevant in those instances. The leases are not worth anything because the tenants have lived there for such a considerable time. The Under-secretary should consider that without that division, elderly and, in many instances, vulnerable people, who, over the years of their lease, have kept absolute faith with the conditions, would find themselves homeless. I am not overstating the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not want the hon. Lady to be at cross purposes with what is proposed. I accept that some leaseholders may find themselves in a difficult position. However, we are talking about leaseholders who have failed in their obligations, whose conduct is such that one or more of the grounds for forfeiture could be made. We are not talking about the innocent leaseholders described by the hon. Lady; we are trying to protect them. I hope that the hon. Lady will support our proposals, especially those on service charges. I am sure that the hon. Lady, with her customary fairness, will accept that not all tenants are perfect. Although we have rightly focused on the well-documented cases of landlords who set out to systematically abuse the system, we must not lose sight of the fact that we need to ensure a balance.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0509">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 899</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I absolutely agree with the Minister that there are bad tenants. However, the Bill still leaves power in the hands of unscrupulous landlords who will, as has happened in my constituency, define those who are elderly and who are outliving their financial means as bad tenants and will attempt to remove them. That is why the division is so necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Lady gains satisfaction from the fact that we are separating forfeiture and the determination of service charges, and that she will support the change. Under that proposal, tenants who are alleged to owe service charges—possibly unreasonable charges—will not, in the first instance, face forfeiture; instead, a determination will be made by a leasehold valuation tribunal. As for tenants who may face forfeiture on other grounds under section 146, a court order will have to be made. My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire with his legal experience, is probably aware that courts make few forfeiture orders. The hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate referred to selling, but even in those rare cases, it is open to the tenant to make the necessary arrangements to sell or dispose of his interest in the lease before forfeiture takes place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the force behind the amendment proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire. I paraphrase what he proposes. He believes that it is disproportionate that a lessee should lose a valuable lease for a comparatively small sum of money. However, my hon. Friend should consider the practical effect of the amendment, which provides that, on forfeiture, the landlord
<br><blockquote><p>"shall sell the remainder of the lease".</p></blockquote>
In practice, many leases would come onto the market because of a disputed procedure. Fewer responsible landlords would buy those leases, and the leases would become cheaper; more landlords would become less responsible and less likely to carry out proper maintenance.<br><br>
While all those leases were being sold, the properties would not be properly maintained because of the uncertainty. Finally, if a block of flats was managed by a company on behalf of the lessees, other lessees would be disadvantaged by the one lessee who refused to pay and on whom forfeiture proceedings were instituted. They, too, would be disadvantaged and would not want such an amendment to be made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an interesting analysis of what might arise in such a situation. I remind my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire, who feels strongly about the matter, that the Law Commission recently considered the law of forfeiture in its report on the termination of tenancies; that report followed extensive consultation. I am sure that he will take account of the fact that the Law Commission did not recommend the changes that he is advocating.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend say how that would equate with the position of someone who had a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 900</span>
mortgage that they were unable to pay? The interest on a mortgage would be unpaid, which would result in repossession.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a different legal interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, there is not. I have never heard such nonsense. Someone may pay £ 150,000 for the lease of a flat, but as they get older, they may not be able to pay the service charge. How is that different from the inability to pay the interest on a mortgage? Why should not such a person be in the same position as someone who is unable to pay the mortgage, is subject to repossession and gets his money back on the mortgage after deduction of the service charge? It is so simple.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an interesting legal analysis. Unfortunately, he does not entirely take account of the practicalities. I have already described how the law of forfeiture operates only rarely and the steps that tenants can take to realise their interest before the forfeiture takes effect.<br><br>
There may be disputes between my hon. Friends the Members for Cirencester and Tewkesbury and for North-West Leicestershire and between the latter and the Law Commission, but I believe that I have answered the points about the amendments.<br><br>
The next series of amendments concerns costs. I sympathise with much of what my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire said, but I have to be concerned about some of the practicalities. It is clearly unfortunate in cases in which landlords behave totally unreasonably that tenants should have to incur costs to enforce their rights, but one of the principal reasons for transferring disputes about service charges to be heard by a leasehold valuation tribunal is that it will be more straightforward and less expensive for tenants to undertake such proceedings. I hope that that will find favour with the Committee.<br><br>
At the moment, one of the principal reasons for tenants not pursuing their rights through the county court procedure is the fear that if they lose, the court may award costs against them. We have already heard about the experience of litigation and there is always the worry that such costs could be substantial.<br><br>
We believe that the advantage of going to a leasehold valuation tribunal, as we propose, is that the costs will be much more certain and often much lower than for full court proceedings. The tenants will have to pay the application fee and their own costs of representation. In many cases, they could be represented by the surveyor appointed under the provisions of new clause 44. The proposals of my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire would reverse that position and the treatment of costs at a leasehold valuation tribunal would be as they are at county courts now, so tenants would be back at square one.<br><br>
I also remind the Committee that new clause 42 contains further safeguards that may help tenants in certain cases. It gives the Secretary of State an order
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0510">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 901</span>
making power that will allow the leasehold valuation tribunal to require either party to reimburse the other with an amount equal to the application fee for the proceedings. It also provides that the fee may be waived with reference to the financial resources of the applicant.<br><br>
There is also a provision in subsection (5) to allow that on the application of the tenant the leasehold valuation tribunal may make an order to the effect that the landlord cannot recharge the tenants through the service charge for his costs of the proceedings. That, I think, will be of interest to the Committee.<br><br>
Those are useful and important safeguards against unreasonable behaviour of landlords and are intended to ensure that the new procedures are a simple and as cheap as possible for the tenants to use, so as to remove their anxieties and give them greater confidence. At the same time, taking a balanced approach, they are intended to be fair and reasonable to all parties, irrespective of the outcome of the proceedings. I do not think that the amendments would assist in the achievement of that and I therefore have to resist them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall comment briefly on new clause 42 and the amendments to it. We support the principle of the new clause and we support the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire in relation to the landlord's commission—amendments (d) and (e)—for reasons that we have already spelt out.<br><br>
Amendment (h) is a technical amendment to include arbitration proceedings in the list of proceedings to which no costs shall apply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hate to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but I thought that I was giving way to him on the point that we wanted to raise about what I had said. I had not finished, as I wanted to respond to the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock) and to take things in the order in which hon. Members have contributed to the Committee. I shall give way to him if he wants to continue on this point, but I shall return to points that were made by the hon. Lady, and to his earlier contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What I propose, Mrs. Winterton, if it is acceptable to you and to the Minister, is to complete my comments on new clause 42 and our amendments. We shall then happily listen to the Minister's observations on our previous amendments to new clause 41, on our amendments to new clause 42 and on the hon. Lady's amendments.<br><br>
Amendment (h) is a technical amendment to include arbitration proceedings along with leasehold valuation tribunal proceedings among those for which no costs are applicable, in accordance with the Government's provisions. That is right because there will clearly be arbitration proceedings and the principle should apply equally to them. I hope the Government will accept that amendment.<br><br>
Amendment (i) is a more substantial amendment which is equally prompted by a concern for achieving
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 902</span>
affordable justice. The threat of appeals and the costs associated with them are used frequently by landlords to deter leaseholders from pursuing their rights. We believe that it is right to place limitations on the scope for such appeals which are prompted solely by the desire to wear down or intimidate the leaseholder. Therefore we propose that the right of appeal should be restricted to two circumstances: to points of law—clearly it is right and proper for there to be a right of appeal on all matters of law—or to questions of fact where the leasehold valuation tribunal allows an appeal.<br><br>
There will be matters of fact which are finely balanced, where the LVT will reach a decision one way, but will accept that there is a perfectly legitimate interpretation that could produce another view. In those circumstances it would clearly be reasonable to allow an appeal.<br><br>
Those are the limitations and they are designed, as I have said, to ensure that leaseholders are able to pursue their case without being exposed to the risk of serious additional costs by landowners who are much better off than they are and who are able to deploy large resources and expensive lawyers and intimidate leaseholders with the fear of the consequent costs.<br><br>
We understand why the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire proposes his amendments on costs, but we believe that our amendment is a better way of achieving it. I only ask him to consider whether, in view of the fact that the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury specifically advocated scope for costs in relation to a number of these proceedings, it is not better to accept the framework that the Government have set forward and which we intend to reinforce by restricting rights of appeal to matters of law and those difficult cases of fact. That is why we are not supporting those amendments, although we are supporting his other amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the leasehold valuation tribunal is a lay body and it would be contrary to the rules of natural justice to have no right of appeal to the court?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman clearly was not listening to what I was saying. We are offering a right of appeal in relation to any point of law and to points of fact where the leasehold valuation tribunal grants that right of appeal. I have made the point that there will be matters of fact where there is an element of doubt and it would be perfectly right and proper for those to be subject to appeal. However, and I hope that he will agree, we do not support having a completely open-ended scope for pursuing appeals solely in order to intimidate or wear down leaseholders. Some landowners make it clear from the outset that once a leaseholder pursues any of his rights under the existing legislation, and they will undoubtedly take the same view of the new legislation, they will fight it through every possible stage in order to drive the leaseholder either to bankruptcy or to abandoning his case. That is not justice. It is an outrage and we need to stop it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond to the points that the hon. Member for Greenwich has just made and then
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0511">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 903</span>
return to his earlier contribution on a different subject. He has just made an interesting speech. I shall deal with matters in reverse order and start with amendment (i) to new clause 42. This amendment seeks to limit the right of appeal from a decision of a leasehold valuation tribunal on a service charge dispute. The parties would be able to appeal only on a point of law or on a question of fact only with the leave of the Lands Tribunal.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman presented his case in terms of the fear that many leaseholders may have that, although they may take a case to the leasehold valuation tribunal without significant legal expense or the risk of having to meet the other side's costs if they are unsuccessful and all the anxiety that that can cause, the landlord will appeal to the lands tribunal where legal representation is more common and where costs are awarded. I have sympathy with that argument. As I hope I made clear earlier, the point of giving a jurisdiction to the leasehold valuation tribunal is to settle service charge disputes to avoid the cost and formality of a dispute in the county court. It is possible that those advantages would be lost if an appeal to the lands tribunal became the norm.<br><br>
But would it be right to limit the rights of appeal? I have several points to make about that. The approach set out in the amendment would be a fundamental change in the way in which the lands tribunal operates. Although the legislation refers to an appeal, in practice the procedure followed by the lands tribunal is not what most people might assume that means. When an appeal is made, the lands tribunal hears the case de novo—in other words, from scratch. The lands tribunal hears the evidence itself and reaches its own decision, rather than just inquiring whether the leasehold valuation tribunal has made a mistake.<br><br>
Currently, the lands tribunal has no experience of, or procedures for, operating a system of appeal by leave or for inquiring into whether the original tribunal might have made some error of law or fact in the way in which the amendment contemplates. The hon. Gentleman is suggesting a fairly significant change in the way in which the lands tribunal operates. I am not saying that change is not possible, but the hon. Member for Greenwich should realise that the amendment is more than just a matter of detail. It raises important issues to be considered.<br><br>
There is then the matter of whether it would be right in principle to limit appeal rights. It is a fairly general feature of our court and tribunal system that decisions are subject to review. I believe that it was Lord Denning who said that the job of a court of first instance was to be quick, courteous and wrong so that superior courts could have the privilege of being right.<br><br>
I hope that leasehold valuation tribunals will not often be wrong, but they are composed of men and women who are mortal. Judgments are always fallible and all of us sometimes make mistakes. Is it right that we should accept that leasehold valuation tribunals may make an occasional mistake that may go uncorrected, in the interests of having an accessible system? Or are the amounts at stake of such significance that the risk of injustice arising through having no right of appeal is unacceptable? Such considerations are important.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 904</span>
Although many service charge disputes may concern relatively small amounts, service charges on large blocks can be substantial. In some cases, they run to more than £1 million a year. When a major refurbishment project is under way, significant amounts of money may be at stake. The implications of an adverse judgment can be serious if a landlord is prevented from recovering sums of that magnitude. A leasehold valuation tribunal may be more knowledgeable about building matters than some county court judges, but they are essentially laymen in the judicial process. For example, they sit only occasionally—perhaps once a month. However, the hon. Member for Greenwich raised an important issue that I wish to discuss with my right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor, who has responsibility for the lands tribunal. As I have said, I am sympathetic to the hon. Gentleman's aim, which is consistent with our objectives under the new clause. I hope that he will withdraw the amendment, so that the practicalities and principles involved can be explored further.<br><br>
Amendment (h) adds to the express provision in new clause 42 that a leasehold valuation tribunal cannot award costs to either party to the effect that that prohibition would also apply to any arbitration proceedings held to settle a service charge dispute. The amendment provides that, if a dispute about service charges is settled by arbitration rather than by reference to a leasehold valuation tribunal, the arbitration tribunal would be unable to award costs to either party. That would then be a parallel position to the treatment of costs by a leasehold valuation tribunal.<br><br>
I am not convinced that we need to make such a change to arbitration proceedings. The provisions for seeking a judgment from a leasehold valuation tribunal will be available to tenants if they wish to make use of them. An alternative will be for both parties to agree to go to arbitration and, in that case, they—the tenants and landord—can also agree the specific treatment of costs.<br><br>
The other case will be when the lease provides for disputes to be settled by arbitration. The lease will specifiy how costs are to be dealt with or, in default, the arbitration tribunal has a general power to decide how costs should be awarded. A lease is a private contract entered into voluntarily by both parties, and I see no good reason to alter the arrangements. I therefore oppose amendment (h).<br><br>
Having disposed of the two amendments tabled by my hon. Friend—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not the Minister's hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg the hon. Gentleman's pardon. I do not want to be the victim of his impish sense of humour.<br><br>
I turn to the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Christchurch, starting with amendment (b) to new clause 41, which would insert a new subsection that deals with cases where payments are demanded from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0512">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 905</span>
the tenant for both service charges and some other issue within the terms of the lease.<br><br>
I can understand the purpose behind the amendment, but I cannot see the justification for legislating to provide for such an unlikely case. If amounts are being demanded fom the landlord for—say—ground rent and service charge payments, and the tenant wishes to dispute the service charge element, all that is required is for the tenant to give reasons why he is withholding a certain sum. The tenant has the initiative here and providing he gives such simple reasons it would not be possible for the landlord to misappropriate the payment to a different account.<br><br>
I hope that that sets the hon. Lady's mind at rest. I do not think that the amendment adds anything useful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be easier if we take it in stages. I hear what the Minister says, and I hope that he will be proved right. We have had problems with previous legislation. Tenants tend not to go into legislation in the detail that landlords do. The amendment was an attempt to give tenants a little more clout. But I accept what the Minister said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Lady's objective, and I hope that she has been reassured by what I have told her.<br><br>
I now turn to amendments (a), (b) and (c) to new clause 42, by which the hon. Member for Christchurch sought clarification on whether there might be an agreement between the parties.<br><br>
As drafted, the new clause would not allow a leaseholder to go to the leasehold valuation tribunal if he had previously agreed the reasonableness of a service charge. We provided for this in the interests of efficiency and fairness. We want to prevent the situation arising where, for example, a leaseholder agrees that work needs doing or that an estimate is reasonable, the landlord carries out the work on that basis and spends the money, and the leaseholder then seeks a ruling about whether the work was really necessary. Clearly, where one party has acted on a decision which another party has made, there should not be scope for the other party to change his mind.<br><br>
However, I accept that there is a risk that the effect could be that a leaseholder would inadvertently lose the right to challenge a service charge before a leasehold valuation tribunal, by some action which could be construed as agreement of which the leaseholder did not appreciate the significance.<br><br>
It may be possible to approach the situation in a better way. We could remove the bar on going to the leasehold valuation tribunal, but allow instead the tribunal to draw inferences from what people had previously done. If a leaseholder had written a letter, for example, agreeing that work was necessary, the tribunal would weigh that in account and draw the appropriate inference to decide the issue. I will explore with the parliamentary draftsmen whether we can achieve that effect, taking account of the points that the hon. Lady made.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 906</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that other members of the Committee were also concerned about the drafting. It is not often that the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Clifton-Brown) and I are batting on the same wicket. I am grateful to the Minister, because what he has said is very helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady. I am afraid that I cannot be so helpful about amendment (c) to new clause 42, which raises the question of the effect of decisions of the leasehold valuation tribunal. If leaseholders get a favourable decision at such a tribunal, they will not need to go to court, they will simply be relieved of having to pay the charge. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Lady on amendment (c).<br><br>
On amendment (a) to new clause 44, I may make the hon. Lady slightly happier again. The amendment relates to the question of surveyors who are residents in the blocks in question. The new right for residents' associations to appoint their own surveyors to assess proposed works currently excludes those who are resident in the property from acting on behalf of their association. We have included this measure so that tenants may have an independent assessment of what the landlord proposes. The amendment would allow tenants who were also professionally qualified to act for their residents association. We have sounded out the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and I understand that no reasons of professional etiquette prevent a resident surveyor from acting in this way.<br><br>
One disadvantage of the proposal is that it would mean allowing one resident to see private correspondence between another private resident and the landlord. However, overlooking that, there is merit in the hon. Lady's amendment. I hope that I offer her some satisfaction by accepting it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I am a little more used to this than I was last week. Some colleagues read <i>Hansard</i> the previous time amendments of mine were accepted and said, "I can imagine her saying this." However, I feel slightly more controlled this morning. I am getting used to it. I hope that the amendment will prove helpful to tenants and surveyors alike.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems to be an up and down morning for the hon. Lady. I am afraid that the next reply will be down. New clause 64 relates to limiting management costs. The hon. Lady spoke about this, referring to various leaseholders organisations.<br><br>
The new clause seeks to introduce a new limit on the level of management costs that a landlord may pass on to tenants as part of their service charge liability by amending section 19 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985. At present section 19 limits the amount of service charge payable by a leaseholder, including charges relating to management costs, to what is considered reasonable. If a leaseholder receives a service charge bill, including one relating to management costs, and believes it to be excessively high, he has the right to ask a court to decide whether the charge is reasonable. This is an important right.<br><br>
The Government take the view that introducing a new limit either as a fixed amount or as an annual
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0513">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 907</span>
percentage would cause more problems than it would solve. It is extremely difficult to quantify the level of management involved in the running of a property and, consequently, costs can vary tremendously. Therefore it would be impractical to introduce a rigid set of rules along the lines suggested. Indeed, doing so might lead to landlords, instead of charging separately for their management costs, simply including them as part of other service charge items without identifying them.<br><br>
Consideration of how to calculate management fees to be recharged has always presented a problem. This has led various organsiations representing management associations, including the Association of Retirement Housing Managers, to issue guidelines to members on what may be considered best practice. All believe that a straight percentage should not be adopted unless, of course, the lease provides for this approach. I find it difficult to see how introducing a new limit on the level of rechargeable management costs would reduce the overall burden on leaseholders. As I have said, it might even increase the burden when landlords include their management costs elsewhere—in which case the leaseholder would have to revert to his existing right by contesting the amount as unreasonable in court. Unhappily for the hon. Lady, I have to reject her amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully and I understand what the Minister is saying. I hope that he is right in saying that the guidance to be given to landlords will be of help. This is a problem, although I do not intend to press the matter to a Division. I hope that we shall not have to return to this in a few years' time. It is clear that the Minister understands the difficulty, and it would be helpful if it could be reasonably dealt with in some way. My worry is that it will arise again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. Lady says.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Greenwich dealt with new clause 81 earlier. It extends the principle behind Government new clause 41 to cover almost all actions for forfeiture rather than just those concerning service charges. Residential leases often contain a number of convenants that restrict a leaseholder's activities. For example, they may prohibit commercial or immoral activities, and the Committee will be familiar with such prohibitions following our debates on social housing tenancies. Conditions on tenants can even prevent them from hanging out washing on Sundays. Where the original freeholder had strong views on the subject, some leases prevent brewing.<br><br>
Many of the covenants are for the benefit of other leaseholders in the block as well as for the benefit of the landlord. If a leaseholder is in breach of one of the covenants, it is open to the landlord to enforce the covenant by seeking forfeiture. We have heard a little about forfeiture this morning and I do not propose to revisit that ground because the Committee explored it with some interest. However, I should explain that a leaseholder can apply for relief from forfeiture in the way outlined earlier.<br><br>
The Government thought it right that forfeiture should not be used as the first resort in resolving
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 908</span>
disputes about service charges for several reasons. There is often a genuine dispute about the reasonableness of what is demanded. It is right that there should be an opportunity to resolve that dispute by negotiation, arbitration or a ruling from a judicial body before the full process of forfeiture is set in motion. That is particularly important because it has unfortunately been the practice of some building societies to pay up any disputed service charges over the leaseholder's head at the first sign that a forfeiture application is under way. As I have pointed out, forfeiture is quite a weapon to wield. Although one can see why the building societies do that, it does undermine a leaseholder's position considerably.<br><br>
The same considerations do not apply in the case of other breaches of covenant. It is less necessary to have two sets of legal proceedings to determine whether, for example, a flat is being used for immoral purposes. There is already a provision that a landlord must serve a notice before proceedings can take place. I heard what the hon. Member for Greenwich said about notices under section 146 of the Law of Property Act 1925, and I give him an assurance that we shall consider his comments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister realises that I am concerned about cases in which there is a bad tenant and a good landlord. Forfeiture has a confiscatory nature and it means that a bad tenant will not only lose his home, but will be punished further in respect of the capital value of his home. Will my hon. Friend undertake to reconsider that to ensure that the element of confiscation is removed and that long leaseholders are put in the same position as freeholders when their premises are entered by a mortgagor?<br><br>
If there were equality in that sense, I would not have any qualms. I agree with the points that my hon. Friend the Minister is making and with what he is trying to do. However, I do not like provisions for confiscation and punishment. That should not be the role of such legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is revisiting an interesting point, which arose earlier. I think that he will agree that, in this context, we are concerned with forfeiture as a way of dealing with the relationships between landlords and tenants who have gone off the rails. I am sure that he will accept that that may affect other tenants as well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A tenant may be schizophrenic or may have mental difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that. As I said earlier, matters must come to court before a forfeiture order can be made. Forfeiture is subject to a court order and safeguards are in place. I invite my hon. Friend's attention to the importance of forfeiture, in these circumstances.<br><br>
New clause 81 would confer a jurisdiction on the leasehold valuation tribunal to deal with such disputes. I am not sure that that is appropriate. Disputes about whether a covenant is being observed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0514">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 909</span>
are more properly dealt with in a court setting than before a tribunal that is more expert in the management and valuation of property. The proposal of the hon. Member for Greenwich would begin to turn the leasehold valuation tribunal into a housing court, and I am not sure that that would be appropriate.<br><br>
I accept that forfeiture has been used oppressively. Last Tuesday, the hon. Member for Greenwich drew attention to that matter, which is of wide concern. We are targeting this reform specifically on that aspect, and we do not think it appropriate to go wider, so I cannot accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary will notice that I explained that there were three differences between new clause 81 and Government new clause 41, which specifically deals with disputes over service charges. Earlier, he said that it was entirely reasonable and proper for a leasehold valuation tribunal to consider such matters. I find it difficult to understand why he wants to avoid including leasehold valuation tribunals within the definitions because they are not included in the definitions in Government new clause 41, as currently drafted, and one of the reasons for the proposal is that it rectifies an obvious omission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We will certainly consider any definitional issues to give effect to our intention. However, our intention remains the same—to confine the operation of the leasehold valuation tribunals to service charge and forefeiture matters. As the hon. Member for Greenwich will know, the definition of service charges is already wide. It would be inappropriate to extend the definition further. I hope that that deals with the points made by the hon. Member for Greenwich and with all other points relating to the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not forgotten my hon. Friend. I was about to deal with the questions that he asked. I dealt with the amendments first because I wanted to get them out of the way. I shall now deal with my hon. Friend's helpful observations, in which he brought to bear his experience of such matters. My hon. Friend suggested that Government new clause 41 might be incorrectly drafted. We are certainly prepared to consider and take account of that matter. On the point that my hon. Friend made about the leasehold valuation tribunal, it can sit with a single member if parties involved agree. My hon. Friend will see that, under subsection (5) of Government new clause 42, a tenant can make an application for a court order to ensure that costs will not be taken into account when determining the amount of service charges. I hope that my hon. Friend will study that carefully. However, I have listened carefully to what he has said, and I will reflect on the important points that have been made about definitions.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 910</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I make it clear that I will press amendments (a) and (c) to Government new clause 41 to a Division because I have not received assurances that the Government will reconsider confiscatory nature of forfeiture? May I make it clear also that I will not press amendments (f), (g) and (j), which relate to costs, because I am satisfied with the Minister's arguments on such matters?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we vote, can we deal with the other new clauses in the group? They have not been referred to in detail; some of them have not been referred to at all. It would be wrong not to mention them briefly. So I shall simply explain the reasons for the new clauses for which we are responsible and give our views on the other Government new clauses.<br><br>
We support the extension of the grounds in the 1987 Act under Government new clause 43. Tenants should have such a remedy, but we have some reservations about the likely effectiveness of that route. As I said earlier, there is no evidence of any successful cases in the nine years since the Act was passed. Costs are a major deterrent. Although the new clause is a welcome extension of the remedies that are theoretically available to leaseholders, it is unlikely to provide the expected help in practice.<br><br>
The Government make a great song and dance about new clause 44, which, with its associated huge schedule, is enormously long. It grants the right to have a surveyor, which is understandable, but has little value in practice because anyone can appoint a surveyor under current law. No statute debars a leaseholder from hiring a surveyor. Clarification of that right, and the leaseholder's right to information from the freeholder is welcome, but hardly a major step forward. We are worried about the potential proliferation of costs in the tendency towards professionalising the whole process.<br><br>
New clause 80 is a technical amendment to provisions on services charges. Under section 20B of the 1985 Act, which is amended by schedule 2 of the 1987 Act, tenants are not liable for service charges if the costs have been incurred more than 18 months before the demand for payment is served. Ambiguity exists about the date that applies to that provision. There is also ambiguity about other dates, which we shall discuss this afternoon. When a rolling programme of works is in progress, a landlord may not know the full cost before 18 months have elapsed from the start of the work. There is usually a 12-month retention period before the final payment is settled. If the phased programme lasts more than six months, as happens with some estate action schemes and projects, a local authority would be in the curious position of having to issue notice before knowing the final costs. It would be administratively cumbersome and expensive to make a series of demands and could result in the leaseholder being charged too much because the local authority has made the claim before knowing the final figures.<br><br>
I do not often say polite things about the City of Westminster, but the case of Westminister <i>v.</i> Hammond highlighted the problem. Local
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0515">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 911</span>
authorities believe that it would be helpful if the date on which the service charge applies is that on which the works are completed. That removes the need for interim demands to cover stage payments, and the risk of local authorities being unable to cover costs because 18 months has elapsed since the start of the works. In the Westminister <i>v.</i> Hammond case, it was implied that the start of works constituted the trigger date. I hope that the Government will treat new clause 80 sympathetically, because it will help to clarify an area of law that is currently unclear and unhelpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman said, new clause 80 is a technical amendment. A great deal depends on when the 18 months begins—from the start of works or from the time when payment was made. I understood that it was the latter. That might make a difference to hon. Members' analysis. I appreciate that the new clause has been tabled on behalf of Westminster council, but the Association of Council Leaseholders strongly opposes it. I appreciate that it deals with a technical matter, which involves legal judgments, and I would like an opportunity to reflect on it further. However, I cannot give the hon Gentleman any guarantee, and my position is coloured by the strong opposition of the Association of Council Leaseholders to the proposal.</span></p>
