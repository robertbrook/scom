<div class='debates'><span class='label label-warning'>debates</span>

<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Housing Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Raynsford <span class='memberconstituency'>(Greenwich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Winterton. On Tuesday, we discussed the respective consultations on the licensing of houses in multiple occupation in England and Wales. The Under-secretary of State for Wales, the hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Jones) said that, although a consultation paper had not been issued, he and the then Secretary of State for Wales, the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood),
<br><blockquote><p>"were no less concerned about the need to take action and to consult properly. If anything, there was more effective consultation in Wales than there was elsewhere."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee G,</i> 20 February 1996; c. 208.]</p></blockquote>
I carried out a little research and found a copy of the consultation paper which was issued by the Secretary of State of Wales. It covers two not fully typed sides of A4 paper, in contrast with a document comprising 24 closely typed pages of well-supported arguments setting out the cases for and against licensing in England. The presentation of the two-sided—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that, as a seasoned and experienced hon. Member, you will be aware that that is not a point of order for me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I defer to your ruling, Mrs. Winterton. I was hoping to receive an explanation from the Under-Secretary of State for Wales about the other documents that might have been made available for consultation. Clearly, the document to which I referred does not satisfy his explanation that there was full consultation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that there will be further opportunities later in our proceedings for such matters to be raised in a proper manner.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Winterton. I wish to draw your attention to the <i>Hansard</i> report of our proceedings on Tuesday morning when we were discussing houses in multiple occupation. I quoted a letter from a solicitor in Blackpool, which stated that tenants were paying only £100 per week, which was why the repairs to the property were not being carried out. The record of our proceedings stated that:
<br><blockquote><p>"the tenants are only paying £100,000 per week".—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee G,</i> 20 February 1996; c. 225.]</p></blockquote>
I do not want to be misquoted. I was trying to put a strong case in favour of the amendment. I ask that the record be put straight, Mrs. Winterton.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Member's point has been taken and that the record of our proceedings will be corrected in due course.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 278</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Winterton. I refer to the consultation document on Wales and the mechanics of the issue. On Tuesday, the Under-Secretary of State for Wales said that he would circulate to the Committee copies of the document to which he was referring, which is normal practice. As I have not yet received a copy of the document, I wonder whether the Department is having problems with its photocopying facilities. It is obviously under great strain if it cannot produce copies of a one-and-a-half page document.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is for the Minister to make available copies of the document which, no doubt, will be made available though the usual channels. May I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that he checks his post.</span></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Orders of the Committee [6th and 15th February] be amended with the following effect:-</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Bill be further considered in the following Order: Clauses 62 to 74, new Clauses and new Schedules relating to Part 11, Clauses 91 to 106, Schedule 8, Clauses 107 to 121, new Clauses and new Schedules relating to Part V, Clause 75, Schedule 4, clauses 76 to 81, Schedule 5, new Clauses and new Schedules relating to Chapter I of Part III, Clauses 87 and 88, Schedule 6, Clauses 89 and 90, Schedule 7, new Clauses and new Schedules relating to Part IV, Clauses 122 to 134, Schedule 9, Clause 135, new Clauses and new Schedules relating to Part VI, Clauses 136 to 167, Schedule 10, Clauses 168 and 169, new Clauses and new Schedules relating to Part VII, Clauses 82 to 86, remaining new Clauses and remaining new Schedules relating to Part III, Clause 170, Schedule 11, Clauses 41 to 48, Clauses 171 to 175, Schedule 12, Clauses 176 to 181, remaining new Clauses, remaining new Schedules, [<i>Mr. Curry.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Government new clause 7—<i>Registration schemes: special control provisions</i>
<br><blockquote><p>'.—(1) In Part XI of the Housing Act 1985 (houses in multiple occupation), after section 348A (inserted by section 63 above) insert—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"Special control provisions.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><br><blockquote><p>348B.—(1) A registration scheme which contains control provisions may also contain special control provisions, that is, provisions for preventing houses in multiple occupation, by reason of their existence or the behaviour of their residents, from adversely affecting the amenity or character of the area in which they are situated.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2) Special control provisions may provide for the refusal or revocation of registration, for reducing the number of households or persons for which a house is registered and for imposing conditions of registration.</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0163">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 279</span>
<br><blockquote><p>(3) The conditions of registration may include conditions relating to the management of the house or the behaviour of its occupants.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(4) Special control provisions may authorise the revocation of registration in the case of—
<ol>
<li>occupation of the house by more households or persons than the registration permits, or</li>
<li>a breach of any condition imposed in pursuance of the special control provisions.</li></ol>
which is due to a relevant management failure.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(5) Special control provisions shall not authorise the refusal of—
<ol>
<li>an application for first registration of a house which has been in operation as a house in multiple occupation since before the introduction by the local housing authority of a registration scheme with special control provisions, or</li>
<li>any application for renewal of registration of a house previously registered under such a scheme.</li></ol>
unless there has been a relevant management failure.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(6) Special control provisions may provide that in any other case where an application is made for first registration of a house the local housing authority may take into account the number of houses in multiple occupation in the vicinity in deciding whether to permit or refuse registration</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Special control provisions: general provisions as to decisions and appeals.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><br><blockquote><p>348C.—(1) Special control provisions shall provide that the local housing authority shall give a written statement of their reasons to the applicant where they refuse to grant his application for first registration, or for a renewal or variation of a registration, or impose conditions of registration on such an application.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2) Special control provisions shall provide that the authority shall give written notice to the person having control of the house and the person managing it of any decision by the authority—
<ol>
<li>to vary the conditions of registration (otherwise than on an application to which subsection (1) applies), or</li>
<li>to revoke the registration of the house,</li></ol>
and at the same time give them a written statement of the authority's reasons.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(3) Where in accordance with special control provisions the local housing authority—
<ol>
<li>notify an applicant that they refuse to grant his application for first registration or for the renewal or variation of a registration.</li>
<li>notify such an applicant of the imposition of conditions of registration, or</li>
<li>give notice to the person having control or the person managing the house of any such decision as is mentioned in subsection (2),</li></ol>
that person may, within 21 days of being so notified, or such longer period as the authority may in writing allow, appeal to the county court.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(4) If on appeal it appears to the court—
<ol>
<li>that there has been any informality, defect or error in, or in connection with, the authority's decision, or</li>
<li>that the authority acted unreasonably.</li></ol>
the court may reverse or vary the decision of the authority.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(5) In so far as an appeal is based on the ground mentioned in subsection (4)(a), the court shall dismiss the appeal if it is satisfied that the informality, defect or error was not a material one.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(6) Where the decision of the authority was a refusal—
<ol>
<li>to grant an application for first registration of a house, or</li>
<li>for the renewal or variation of the registration,</li></ol>
the court may direct the authority to grant the application as made or as varied in such manner as the court may direct.</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 280</span>
<br><blockquote><p>Special control provisions: occupancy directions.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><br><blockquote><p>348D.—(1) Special control provisions may provide that where the local housing authority decide that the registration of a house should be revoked the authority may direct that the level of occupation of the house be reduced, within such period of not less than 28 days as they may direct, to a level such that (in accordance with section 346(2)) the registration scheme does not apply.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Such a direction is referred to in this Part as an "occupancy direction".</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2) Special control provisions shall provide that the authority shall only make an occupancy direction if it appears to the authority that there has been a relevant management failure resulting in a serious adverse effect on the amenity or character of the area in which the house is situated.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(3) In considering whether to make an occupancy direction the authority shall take into account the interests of the occupants of the house and the person having control of the house as well as the interests of local residents and businesses.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(4) Special control provisions may require the person having control of the house, and the person managing it, to take all reasonably practicable steps to comply with an occupancy direction.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(5) Nothing in the Rent Act of Part I of the Housing Act 1988 prevents possession being obtained by any person in order to comply with an occupancy direction.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(6) Nothing in this section affects any liability in respect of any other contravention or failure to comply with control provisions or special control provisions.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Special control provisions: decisions and appeals relating to occupancy directions.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><br><blockquote><p>348E.—(1) Special control provisions shall provide that where the local housing authority make an occupancy direction in respect of a house they shall give written notice of the direction to the person having control of the house and the person managing it and at the same time give them a written statement of the authority's reasons.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2) A person aggrieved by an occupancy direction may, within 21 days after the date of the service of notice as mentioned in subsection (1), appeal to the county court.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(3) If on appeal it appears to the court—
<ol>
<li>that there has been any informality, defect or error in, or in connection with, the authority's decision, or</li>
<li>that the authority acted unreasonably,</li></ol>
the court may make such order either confirming, quashing or varying the notice as it thinks fit.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(4) In so far as an appeal is based on the ground mentioned in subsection (3)(a), the court shall dismiss the appeal if it is satisfied that the informality, defect or error was not a material one.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(5) If an appeal is brought the direction does not become operative until—
<ol>
<li>a decision on the appeal confirming the direction (with or without variation) is given and the period within which an appeal to the Court of Appeal may be brought expires without any such appeal having been brought, or</li>
<li>if a further appeal to the Court of Appeal is brought, a decision on that appeal is given confirming the direction (with or without variation).</li></ol></p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(6) For this purpose the withdrawal of an appeal has the same effect as a decision confirming the direction or decision appealed against.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Special control provisions: "relevant management failure".</p></blockquote></p>
<p><br><blockquote><p>348F. A "relevant management failure" for the purposes of sections 348B to 348E (special control provisions) means a failure on the part of the person having control of, or the person managing, a house in multiple occupation to take such steps as are reasonably practicable to prevent the existence of the house or the behaviour of its residents from adversely affecting the amenity or character of the area in which the house is situated, or to reduce any such adverse effect.".'.</p></blockquote></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We heard a great deal on Second Reading and in Committee about the problems faced by some towns—seaside towns are often mentioned, but the problem is not confined to them—caused by the proliferation of what have become known as benefit hostels. My right hon. friend the Secretary of state made a commitment on Second Reading to introduce measures that would enhance the powers of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 282</span>
local authorities to tackle such abuses. Our amendments fulfil that commitment, and I shall invite the Committee to accept them.<br><br>
I shall not rehearse the substantive arguments about the nature of the problem; my hon. Friends have done that persuasively and eloquently. There is virtual consensus in the Committee that such problems need to be dealt with. I shall confine my remarks to our proposed remedy. We propose making special control provisions available to local authorities. I shall outline what is special about them.<br><br>
If a local authority adopts a registration scheme that includes special control provisions, it will have four main powers. First, it will be able to refuse the registration of an existing HMO, or refuse to renew its registration, if there has been a management failure. Management failure is defined in new section 348F. It is the failure by the manager of the HMO to take whatever steps are
<br><blockquote><p>"reasonably practicable to prevent the existence of the house or the behaviour of its residents adversely affecting the amenity or character of the area".</p></blockquote>
When I speak of management failure, it is to that definition that I refer. In such a case, the number of residents in an HMO will have to be reduced by natural wastage, to the point at which the property no longer has to be registered. It will be a criminal offence to allow new people to move into such an HMO.<br><br>
Secondly, a local authority will be able to refuse to register a new HMO after a registration scheme has been introduced if the authority believes that there are already enough HMOs in the area and that the presence of another will have an adverse effect.<br><br>
Thirdly, it will be able to revoke a registration if there has been a breach of conditions, or over-occupation due to a management failure.<br><br>
Fourthly, it will be able to impose an occupancy direction when the registration of an HMO is revoked. An occupancy direction would enable a local authority to speed up the reduction in the number of residents; the reduction would be faster than would have occurred by natural wastage. It will provide that the number of people living in the house should be reduced to a level that was not registrable, giving at least 28 days' notice. That is tougher than simply revoking registration, which prevents new people moving in, but allows existing tenants to remain. An occupancy direction may be imposed only if it appears to the authority that a relevant management failure has caused a serious adverse effect on the amenity or character of the area. Once again, the key to the exercise of those powers is management failure.<br><br>
Before making an occupancy direction, the local housing authority must take into account the interests of the occupants of the house and of the person who has control, as well as those of local businesses and residents. That is an important safeguard, which will ensure that the authority looks at both sides of the problem.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0165">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 283</span>
The local authority can use special control provisions to require landlords and managers to take all reasonable steps to comply with an occupancy direction. That will have a similar effect to a closure order, which can be made when a house is unfit. Sufficient residents will have to leave, and statutory regimes of security of tenure will be suspended to allow the owner to obtain possession. People whose applications for registration are refused or varied, or have conditions imposed, or who receive an occupancy direction, must be given a written statement of reasons by the local housing authority. The usual rights of appeal to the county court will also apply in those cases. An appeal will, however, suspend the operation of an occupancy direction until it is finally determined by the county court or the Court of Appeal. The courts will have the power to confirm, reject or vary any notice or direction subject to appeal. We hope that the new powers will encourage owners and managers to impose an active management regime on their premises—we suspect that many of the worst HMO hostels are, frankly, not managed at all. For example, often one of the residents is appointed to hold a key, and everyone else is left to fend for themselves. When neighbours complain about anti-social behaviour, we want owners and managers to co-operate with the police and local authorities to try to deal with it.<br><br>
The provisions are powerful weapons, and we want to ensure that they are used only when necessary. Although the Secretary of State will have the power to include them in model registration schemes, we do not intend to use that power. That means that any local housing authority that believes that it needs to use special control provisions will have to apply to the Secretary of State in order to have them in its armoury. The authority would have to demonstrate a genuine need for using the provisions before consent would be given.<br><br>
We believe that special control provisions will enable those authorities with the worst problems to tackle them effectively. Targeted wisely, they may serve to inspire—or frighten—the next owner in line to clean up his act and help to reverse the spiral of decline that has occurred in some seaside resorts and elsewhere. I commend the amendment to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The first point that must be made about the Government new clause and related amendments is that, yet again, they represent a clear admission by the Government that the Bill as drafted was not adequate to tackle the problems in many areas. We welcome that admission and the moves to create a tougher regulatory regime to deal with serious problems, but we do not believe that the proposals provide a satisfactory alternative to the national licensing scheme that we advocate.<br><br>
While the provisions of the new clause and amendments will allow more effective control of some properties, they will not apply to many other properties with which there are demonstrable problems. On
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 284</span>
Tuesday, we debated at length a series of exclusions from the registration arrangements, such as properties containing four or fewer people and self-contained properties, which, if they remain in the Bill—I accept that the Minister agreed to consider the matter further—will exclude substantial numbers of HMOs in which the very problems that Conservative members of the Committee have highlighted can be found.<br><br>
So we are concerned that the proposals are an inadequate response to a serious problem. We are also troubled by the drafting, which is why we have tabled a series of amendments. With your permission, Mrs. Winterton, I should like to speak in a little more detail about the drafting issues. The new clause as drafted refers to problems that can be attributed to the existence of the property and the behaviour of residents, but it does not refer to failure of management—when moving the amendment, the Minister made the point that many such properties are not managed—or to particular risks, such as the risk of fire, which we know to be one of the most serious risks. Fire caused an appalling tragedy in the constituency of the hon. Member for Scarborough (Mr. Sykes), who has a particular interest in the subject.<br><br>
There might also be conflict between the new clause as drafted and local authority planning powers, which can be used to restrict the number of HMOs created, and which were referred to several times during Tuesday's debate. New clause 7 will allow special control provisions to apply with a view to
<br><blockquote><p>"preventing houses in multiple occupation, by reason of their existence, or the behaviour of their tenants, from adversely affecting the amenity … of the area".</p></blockquote>
If a local authority has specifically allowed an HMO to exist under planning legislation, could it not find difficulty in arguing that the HMO's existence is adversely affecting the amenity or character of the area? At least, that would imply that the left hand of the local authority did not altogether agree with the right hand.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
Indeed, if we take that argument a little further, would not a loophole be produced which could enable an aggrieved proprietor of an HMO to challenge the application of the special control provisions? Such a proprietor could argue that the existence of an HMO was sanctioned under planning powers and, therefore, it was inappropriate for the authority to deem that the HMO's existence was adversely affecting the amenity of the area.<br><br>
The second strand of the argument is the definition of the behaviour of the residents. The Opposition have no doubt that anti-social behaviour, by whomever it is perpetrated, is completely unacceptable and that action must be taken against it, but anti-social behaviour is not only the preserve of the occupants of HMOs or, indeed, tenants. Anti-social behaviour can be committed by anyone.<br><br>
Many years ago when I lived in a certain area of London, the owner-occupiers in the house next door
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0166">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 285</span>
had an extremely flamboyant lifestyle, involving a large consumption of alcohol and behaviour that was extremely disturbing to everyone else in the street. That anti-social behaviour was not attributable to people living in a multi-occupied house.<br><br>
Let us consider a hypothetical situation in which there are two houses—either side by side, or in the same neighbourhood—one of which is owner-occupied, the other an HMO. Let us assume that the occupants of both houses are prone either to hold loud, noisy parties where much alcohol is consumed, or to allow their premises to be used for drug abuse. In such circumstances, might not an aggrieved HMO landlord attempt to challenge the local authority's use of the powers under the special control provisions on the grounds that nothing intrinsically more deleterious to the amenity or character of the area is attributable to the HMO's occupants than is attributable to those in the owner-occupied house?<br><br>
I put those points because we are genuinely worried that the Minister's proposal might make it difficult for effective action to be taken against the genuinely antisocial behaviour of people in inadequately managed HMOs. Such people are a serious problem for their area. Therefore, we have tabled amendment (e) and the associated amendments to Government new clause 7.<br><br>
Amendment (e) would delete the words
<br><blockquote><p>"their existence or the behaviour of their residents"</p></blockquote>
and insert the words
<br><blockquote><p>"the way in which the houses are managed".</p></blockquote>
That comes to the nub of the problem. HMOs in which the occupants are allowed to behave anti-socially, or which are badly managed or not managed—as the Minister highlighted in his remarks—would fall four square within those terms. The owner of the property could not dispute the fact that special control provisions applied. The Minister should consider amendment (e) carefully and give his response to it. Amendment (e) would provide a more accurate and more appropriate definition of the reason for the problem and, therefore, a more effective response to it.<br><br>
On Second Reading and in Tuesday's sittings, we were given distressing examples of the outrageous behaviour of some unscrupulous HMO landlords who deliberately packed their properties with people on social security, neglected the duties associated with running multi-occupied houses and, therefore, allowed an area or, in some cases, a whole resort to suffer. That is the root of the problem and the special control provisions must address it. They should deal with the failure of certain HMO landlords to manage their properties properly and with those who let them be used for inappropriate purposes.<br><br>
I should highlight two more amendments. Amendment (g) to new clause 7 seeks to substitute the period of 56 days for 28 days in new section 348D as the minimum period within which a local authority may require a reduction in the occupation level. The reason for that is simple. If numbers are to be reduced,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 286</span>
occupants will have to be removed; the question is to where. Those who are removed will not necessarily be the guilty parties. We are talking not about evicting people for anti-social behaviour, but about a landlord being required to reduce the numbers of tenants in a house to comply with control provisions. The landlord could simply pick on one or more innocent occupants and terminate their occupancy.<br><br>
Allowing such people a little more time to find alternative accommodation is a necessary provision to minimise the possibility of their ending up homeless on the streets because of a lack of alternative accommodation. That would not mean neighbours' having to put up with anti-social conduct for another 28 days. That would be unacceptable. Where there has been a relevant management failure, we should expect the local authority to impose and enforce conditions. Some of our later amendments highlight the need for a duty of care that can be enforced against the managers or owners of HMOs who fail to keep their properties in order. We are not talking about allowing the problem to continue for a further 28 days. We seek a humane provision to ensure that someone, who may be an entirely innocent party, who loses his or her home is allowed slightly longer to find accommodation.<br><br>
Amendment (h) is related to amendment (g), in that lines 93 to 95 of new clause 7 would allow normal security of tenure provisions to be overriden when an occupancy direction was made to reduce the numbers in a property. We fear that there is clear scope for abuse in that. For example, one might find an HMO in which one secure tenant lives in part of the property and pays a fair rent set by the rent officer which is substantially lower than the rents paid by the other occupants of the HMO. It would be an obvious temptation to a landlord who was subject to a direction on numbers to get rid of the tenant paying the fair rent. That tenant might be an innocent party who had lived in the property for many years, but would be made the victim of the mismanagement of the rest of the property and the behaviour of others who lived there. That would be a clear abuse, but it would be possible under lines 93 to 95 of new clause 7, which would allow the Rent Acts to be overriden by the application of a direction. I hope that the Minister will consider that serious point.<br><br>
We do not want to hamper the ability of local authorities to take effective enforcement action against people who abuse the social security system and act irresponsibly by letting out slum properties, charging extortionate sums and letting them become places of anti-social behaviour. We want effective action, but we do not want to create innocent victims of a proper regulatory framework. We want to make sure that potential loopholes, such as the one that I have discussed, are plugged.<br><br>
The amendments are sensible and necessary. The Government's new clause does not go so far as we would like, but it does something to tackle certain problems. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendments in the spirit in which they were tabled.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 287</span>
We want to ensure that the special control provisions bear down on crooks and the irresponsible without penalising innocent parties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the next speaker, let me say that it would be helpful to me if those who want to catch my eye stand up smartly at the end of each speech. There was a moment's hesitation before I called Mr. Raynsford and, if I had been very sharp, I could have put the question then and proceeded to put the question without debate. I knew that that was not the wish of the Committee, but those who want to catch my eye should, in military fashion, stand up sharply and not get only half way there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Sykes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Scarborough)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: You, Mrs. Winterton, and the Committee, will no doubt be disappointed to hear that the hon. Member for City of Chester (Mr. Brandreth) has asked me to confine my remarks this morning to the bare minimum.<br><br>
At our sitting on Tuesday, it was suggested that Ministers had argued that Scarborough borough council was not in favour of a national licensing scheme. I make it clear now that my council supports a national licensing scheme, and that my remarks and those of Ministers were not intended to suggest otherwise. The council supports the proposals. In a letter to me, it states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The proposed Special Control Provision to regulate those HMOs which by virtue of poor management have an adverse effect on the neighbourhood in which they are situated, accord with the controls in this area which the Borough Council has been seeking and which you have successfully pursued."</p></blockquote>
The amendments have been tabled to ensure that both sides have an interest in the matter being dealt with by the courts as quickly as possible. If a landlord knows that when a tenant leaves he will not be able to replace that tenant until the court has determined his appeal, he will be in a rush to obtain a hearing as quickly as possible, because, as every month passes, he will lose tenants who move out and will not be able to replace them. The town, and individual neighbourhoods, will have just cause to be grateful to the Minister if the amendments are accepted.<br><br>
We want to remove the adjective "serious" in line 83 of the new clause unless the Minister can define how serious the adverse effect will have to be before it becomes a matter for the council to issue an occupancy direction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Elletson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Blackpool, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on new clause 7, which, at last, seriously tackles the problem of HMOs and DSS hostels. He is right to go not for a mandatory national scheme, but for a voluntary opt-in scheme of the type proposed, because that is what the tourist industry wants, as its representations confirm. The response of the British Resorts Association to the consultation paper on improving standards in houses in multiple occupancy states:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 288</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"We have some sympathy with your assessment that a compulsory scheme could lead to excessive cost and increased bureaucracy, and it was precisely for these reasons that we identified the requirement for an adoptive licensing scheme rather than a mandatory one."</p></blockquote>
The Minister is right to go for the scheme proposed because it is a licensing scheme in all but name. The registration and special control provisions in new clause 7 will help substantially to deal with the problems faced by my constituents, those of my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and by people in seaside resorts throughout the country.<br><br>
The new clause could be toughened up, as proposed in the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend. My hon. Friend and I have tabled amendments to clause 63 to tackle the problems involved in ensuring adequate management so that local authorities can take evidence on whether a person is fit and proper to manage a house in multiple occupation. I hope that the Minister will take those amendments seriously, as they will meet many of the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Diana Maddock <span class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an extremely important issue, as hon. Members from all parties recognise. It affects the quality of life of anyone who lives near a property that is causing problems. Among those who have pressed the Government are hon. Members in whose constituency there are many hotels. Residents also suffer when properties cause problems.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
Bournemouth adjoins my constituency, so I am well aware of what has happened there. I also know from experience that it is not only in seaside towns that there are problems with hostels. Problems often occur in areas where there are many students, and in areas with small hotels similar difficulties arise when Department of Social Security hostels open. Not only do they cause disturbance but they can also affect an area's economy, whether it be a seaside resort or any other town. From discussions about Bournemouth and other ordinary larger towns I know that two problems have been identified. If they were dealt with, HMOs would cause less trouble in neighbourhoods. The first is the need for clarification of what constitutes a hostel and what constitutes a hotel. That was originally a problem in Bournemouth. Planning law was not helpful to the local authority when it tried to tackle it. In 1994, an amendment order gave local authorities extra powers to differentiate between a hotel and a hostel. The Bournemouth authority welcomed that, because this is a matter on which the law can be extremely helpful.<br><br>
Management of properties comes under housing law. It is difficult to deal with because housing and planning laws must work properly together. This is why we have some anxiety about new clause 7. We all accept that the Government have tried to solve the problems, but we are still a little concerned.<br><br>
If the Government had taken on board the comments made in earlier debates about a mandatory scheme, they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0168">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 289</span>
would have gone a long way towards answering the queries of councils everywhere. Streamlining of planning law to enable action to be taken more quickly would be helpful. This was clear in Bournemouth, where the authority felt that existing regulations were cumbersome and difficult to put into operation.<br><br>
The drafting of the new clause also causes me concern. I am not a lawyer and many hon. Members are aware of my opinion about the number of lawyers who are Members of the House of Commons. Yet we are here to make laws and it is important that we get it right. One does not have to be in the House for long—especially as a member of a Housing Bill Committee—to realise how important wording is. I know from discussions with lawyers that some words cause problems. I have piloted a private Member's Bill through the House. The first response of the Committee Clerks is usually, "You understand, Mrs. Maddock, that this is a difficult word legally."<br><br>
People have expressed concern about particular words, one of which is "behavior", which is used in the new clause. The other is "vicinity." Defining these words can be difficult. I can envisage lawyers having a bit of a field day. I hope that the Minister will come back on those points and assure us that these terms will not cause problems. We are attempting to enable local authorities to act quickly and if we get into legal wrangles we shall fail to do that.<br><br>
It seems that an authority can adopt special control provisions only within the model scheme prescribed by the Secretary of State—not one designed by themselves. I hope that the Minister will clarify that. Will a local authority have to apply to the Department of the Environment? If so, what representations and documentary evidence will the Secretary of State require should the authorities try to convince them of their need for those powers?<br><br>
There is another matter that slightly concerns me—the hon. Member for Greenwich has touched on it too. Some innocent tenants may have problems finding other housing if the hostels are regulated and turned down. Will the Minister say what research his Department has done on the consequences of that? How many hostels does he anticipate will be affected by the legislation? People are worried that if hostels are closed in an area the former tenants could end up living on the streets. The number of people sleeping out in Bournemouth and Christchurch has increased tremendously in recent years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sykes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way because it gives me the opportunity to mention Scarborough borough council again in this important debate. Its survey suggests that the council would have no difficulty in finding housing for those tenants and that it would not be necessary for people to live on the streets. I refer to the Richmond fire of Thursday 5 May 1994. The borough council very quickly rehoused every tenant within 12 hours of that incident.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, but I know that there is a particular
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 290</span>
problem in my area. It was so dire in the summer that homeless people were accommodated in a holiday camp.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will address the questions that I have asked. In principle, I agree that we must do something. I am concerned that the wording of the clause is a problem; we must ensure that we get it right and do not create something that is cumbersome and takes time to enforce. We should be trying to remedy the present position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I feel as if I am the only member of the Committee who has not mentioned the borough of Scarborough. I should say that it anticipates that it would have to use the most severe form of the powers in no more than five instances in the present range of establishments in the borough. That gives some indication of the context, which is useful.<br><br>
I shall not accept the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Greenwich, but I shall study his remarks in the <i>Official Report.</i> There is consensus in the Committee that we do not want innocent people to suffer. If, after studying his remarks, I can find a way of amending the Bill without losing any of its force I shall not hesitate to table amendments.<br><br>
I am reminded of "Antony and Cleopatra". I think that Enobarbus said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt".</p></blockquote>
It is difficult to ensure when applying the measures that we are discussing that goodwill will reign—if goodwill reigned, we might not have had to introduce these measures in the first place. I give the hon. Member for Greenwich that commitment. I shall explain why I cannot accept the amendments as drafted, and I shall also explain why I invite my hon. Friends the Members for Scarborough and for Blackpool, North (Mr. Elletson) to withdraw their amendments.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock) asked me two questions, the first of which concerned the propensities of lawyers. I hesitate to reply too robustly, in the knowledge that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, who will be dealing with the next group of amendments, is a lawyer, and I would not wish to add the chastisement of my colleagues to that which I receive from my civil servants for appearing to denigrate their powers.<br><br>
With reference to behaviour and vicinity, there is no statutory definition—which is why we have lawyers, I suppose. The natural and ordinary meaning of the words must, therefore, be used, but meaning must be construed in the context of legislation. That probably only restates the hon. Lady's problem, but I cannot take it further for her. I can, however, help her on the other matter that concerned her.<br><br>
The Department will offer model schemes for the special control powers, but it will be available to a local authority to devise its own form of controls and to offer those to the Secretary of State. It is sensible for us to draw up plans to meet the needs of local
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0169">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 291</span>
authorities, but if they want to draw up their own plans, subject to the Secretary of State's approval, we do not propose to exclude that option. That is the sensible way forward.<br><br>
Planning is a difficult area. I used to deal with planning, but I have given up that function in the Department. Planning in our system is not a prescriptive process; it is an indicative process—a way of putting down the landing lights, as it were, without saying where everyone must end up. We have not adopted the American zoning system, whereby an area is cleared for a certain type of development and, once that has been designated, few controls apply, as long as the activities conform with the character of the zoning arrangement. The area is still subject to individual planning decisions, but decisions at appeal bear strongly on the local, county or regional plan, and the indications that have been given. The land use planning arrangements are particularly pertinent in such a case.<br><br>
With regard to the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Greenwich, I want to emphasise what we are trying to achieve through the special control provisions. We aim to prevent a proliferation of HMOs from causing a serious problem to the locality. We have two objectives. Where an existing HMO is generating such problems, and providing that the local authority can demonstrate that there has been a management failure, it will be possible for registration to be withdrawn or refused.<br><br>
I have already described what I mean by management failure; it is carefully defined in the amendment. It includes a requirement for the manager to take whatever steps he can to deal with the behaviour of residents that may be causing problems. The Opposition amendment refers only to the way in which the house is managed. That could seriously weaken the force of the provisions and might not adequately address the problems that we have discussed.<br><br>
There is another weakness in the amendment. The provisions will allow registration to be refused where it is proposed that a new HMO should begin operation in an area. In that case, the local authority may have regard to the number of HMOs in the vicinity when deciding whether to grant registration. In other words, the provisions will allow a local authority, having regard to the number of existing HMOs and any adverse effects that they might produce, to say, "Enough is enough". The amendments relate only to the way in which the house is managed and would make it unclear whether local authorities would continue to have that additional weapon in their armoury.<br><br>
As for amendment (g) to new clause 7, I emphasise that the occupancy direction is for exceptional circumstances, and the provisions restrict its use to cases where the property is causing a serious problem. Several examples have been clearly described to the Committee.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 292</span>
It will be for the local authority to decide what is serious, and there is a right of appeal for the affected parties. In those circumstances, we want the close-down to be as fast as possible, and the 28-day minimum is reasonable. The landlord will have to take positive steps to start the process of ending tenancies—for example, by issuing notices at the earliest possible date.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Greenwich explained his concerns, which I appreciate. The authorities will have to take account of such matters when making the closure direction, but 28 days is a minimum period and local authorities will be at liberty to choose a longer period. The clause specifically requires them to take account of the interests of the occupant and owner of a house, or its manager, as well as those of local residents and businesses. Again, we have tried to strike a balance and we think that we have it about right.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
Amendment (h) relates to statutory security of tenure which will usually be indefinite. The removal of statutory security opens the way for landlords to give tenants notice to quit and to begin possession proceedings against them if necessary. I assure the Committee that this provision to override tenants' rights to security of tenure is precedented by parallel provisions to secure the immediate closure of, for example, slum properties. In both cases exceptional circumstances that call for immediate action are involved. We have already discussed the safeguards in the provisions and in occupancy directions which will ensure that they are used only rarely.<br><br>
However, I have promised the hon. Member for Greenwich that I shall study his comments. We are at one in wishing to narrow opportunities for abuse to the most meagre margin possible. I shall try to find a way of narrowing it even further. I hope that I have reassured my hon. Friends the Members for Scarborough and for Blackpool, North that the drafting as it stands delivers the security that they seek.<br><br>
If a local authority decides to refuse or to revoke registration of an HMO, it will be a criminal offence to allow any new person to move into the house, until the number of occupants has fallen below what the local authority may have specified, or below the number that would make the property subject to registration: the control provisions allow for a phased rundown. Existing tenants can remain, but the landlord cannot allow a new tenant into the property to fill vacancies or replace existing tenants as they leave.<br><br>
The proposed new section 348D relating to special control provisions, goes further than this, by allowing the local authority to issue occupancy directions. These allow the authority to require faster action to close down an HMO, and a landlord must take active steps to reduce the number of residents, including giving some residents notice to quite, and seeking possession orders in court, if necessary.<br><br>
The new provision will clearly have a much more serious effect on landlords, and on tenants. In many cases, tenants will no doubt have brought the problem
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0170">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 293</span>
on themselves, but in any HMO there will be tenants who have not committed any offence. Because this action to issue occupancy directions is more draconian than simply revoking registration, it may be invoked only if there is serious damage to the amenity or character of an area—the issue to which amendment (b) relates.<br><br>
If a local authority decides that it is justified in issuing an occupancy direction, it will, of necessity, also be entitled to refuse or revoke registration. So in addition to the effects provided by the new clause all existing controls relating to registration schemes are likely to apply. Even though 28 days may elapse before the landlord becomes obliged to take active steps to reduce the number of residents, it will be a criminal offence from the date on which the landlord is told that registration has been refused or revoked, to allow new tenants to move in. I hope that that will satisfy my hon. Friends that amendment (a) is unnecessary.<br><br>
Amendments (c) and (d) deal with appeals. New clause 7 provides that if there is an appeal against an occupancy direction, the direction is suspended while the appeal goes through the county court or the Court of Appeal. It would be unfair on both landlords and tenants if they could effectively challenge an occupancy direction only some time after it has been put into effect, because by then an appeal would be entirely academic, and the economic and social damage of an unjustified occupancy direction would have been done.<br><br>
The position with a phased run down made under a control order is different. There is no relevant provision in the Housing Act 1985 or in the new clauses, which provides for the effect of a notice under a control provision to be suspended pending an appeal. Therefore, although a landlord may appeal, it remains an offence for him to admit new tenants until the appeal has been determined. In practice, a local authority may be somewhat reluctant to prosecute in such circumstances, but the legal position is as I have described, and amendment (d) adds nothing to that.<br><br>
Amendment (b) relates to the circumstances in which an occupancy direction may be used. The new clause provides that a local authority may issue a direction if an HMO subject to special control provisions is being managed in a way that results in a
<br><blockquote><p>"serious adverse effect on the amenity or character of the area".</p></blockquote>
I understand and share my hon. Friend's concerns about the problems of badly run hostels in their constituencies. The new provisions are powerful new weapons, which will deal with those problems; the occupancy directions, especially, are designed to cope with exceptional circumstances. We must strike the right balance; reasonable safeguards are needed to ensure that the new powers are not abused. Clearly, an occupancy direction is likely to put a landlord out of business—my hon. Friends may say that that may be richly deserved, which I accept—and it is a very serious step. Similarly, people living in the HMO are likely to lose their homes. In certain cases, that might be justified, but some tenants who lose their homes
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 294</span>
may not be guilty of anti-social behaviour. It is therefore reasonable to require a higher test for an occupancy direction than applies to removing the registration.<br><br>
I apologise for having taken time to explain these matters, but they are most important to all members of the Committee. I have tried to achieve a reasonable balance between allaying my hon. Friends' concerns and incorporating as many safeguards against abuse as possible. As I said earlier, if improvements can be made, I shall examine the matter and reflect on what has been said in our debates. I commend my amendment to the Committee and advise hon. Members against accepting the hon. Gentleman's amendment. I hope that my hon. Friends will withdraw their amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with care to the Minister's comments, but I am not convinced. His reply repeatedly highlighted the management failures of HMOs that are run in a way that threatens the lives and well being of the occupants and causes a serious nuisance to people living in the surrounding areas. Thus we do not understand why the Minister wants to reject amendments that emphasise that the primary concern in deciding whether to impose special control provisions should be how the property is managed. It is ultimately a management provision; the Minister is confusing it with planning powers when he says that it is necessary to have regard to the existence of the property. That should properly be a matter for planning provisions.<br><br>
While we hear what the Minister says about reflecting further on the consequences of amendment (h), we are very worried that he proposes to override existing Rent Acts security and expose people to the risk of homelessness. Unless he can give the Committee an absolute guarantee that people who are displaced from secure lettings as a result of the measure will be rehoused by the local authority in a secure letting, I shall invite my hon. Friends to vote for amendments (e) and (h), as the thrust of parts VI and VII will make it impossible for local authorities to do that, as they can now.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 187, in page 35, leave out lines 33 and 34.<br><br>
As drafted, the Bill will give the Secretary of State power to prepare model registration schemes. I emphasise that the word is schemes, not scheme. The clause states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Different model schemes may be prepared for different descriptions of authorities and for different areas."</p></blockquote>
The amendment would remove that provision. As is clear from previous debates, Labour Members want a national licensing registration scheme. Even though we may disagree about that, we hope that there will be a consensus on having simple and consistent rules for the registration of HMOs. We are using the amendment to explore that issue. The Bill will leave
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0171">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 295</span>
the way open for a great deal of inconsistency as between different sorts of area. Nothing said so far has justified that inconsistency.<br><br>
The inconsistency might be not only between the different model schemes that the Department introduces but between one or more of the model schemes and other orders that the Department is considering. Presumably, the model scheme or schemes could add further exclusions to the range of exclusions under the Bill.<br><br>
Ministers have announced their intention to effect a new means of escape order under section 365(2) of the Housing Act 1985. Such orders require local housing authorities to ensure that the categories of housing encompassed by the order are provided with adequate means of escape in case of fire. I hope that the Minister can clarify that matter, even though I gave notice that I intended to raise it via the private office of the wrong Minister. I understand that the categories of house under the new registration scheme or schemes—in other words, under the Bill—and the categories of house to which new, revised means of escape orders apply might not be the same. At the least, that would be a source of confusion for owners, tenants and local authorities. It seems illogical that houses deemed in need of supervision under a registration scheme should be included also in orders dealing with adequate means of escape in case of fire. Those houses deemed to have a sufficient risk of fire should be included in a registration scheme. In other words—this is especially relevant to the amendment—the two schemes should be harmonised.<br><br>
I am not saying that whenever one proposal applies the other must apply also. Obviously, there could be exceptions, but the two schemes should be harmonised. I hope that the Minister will say whether the registration schemes under the Bill and the proposed new means of escape orders will be harmonised.<br><br>
This part of the Bill exposes another contradiction in the Government's thinking. Whenever the Opposition proposes a national registration scheme, the Government say that we want to centralise and that they want to trust local authorities. Given their attitudes towards local authorities, we find that rather rich.<br><br>
The Government say that they want to trust local authorities. If so, why do they need more than one model scheme? The Bill should include a provision stating that, if a local authority wanted to introduce a registration scheme different from the national scheme, it could apply to the Minister who would consider whether the scheme was right or wrong and whether it was compatible. As the Government do not accept the amendment, they appear to saying that the Minister would decide centrally what should apply to different areas before local authorities approached the Government. That contradicts what the Government have said about wanting to trust local authorities.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 296</span>
Given what was said in Tuesday's debates and given what was alluded to in this sitting, I wonder what sort of scheme the Government might impose on Wales. If a consultation paper in England is rather different from one in Wales—a two-sided sheet of A4 paper seems to equate to a multiple-page consultation document—and when a consultation document called "The Case for Licensing" is quite acceptable in England but not in Wales, I wonder how a model scheme for registration for Wales would differ from one for England. Would a Welsh scheme say, "Houses in multiple occupation must be registered", but not oblige certain standards to be imposed because the Secretary of State for Wales had a hang-up about regulation?<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
I hope that Minister will say why they want the power to impose different registration schemes in different areas, but how will they ensure the necessary consistency? Of course, they could avoid those problems if there was a national mandatory licensing scheme. It is not our fault that they decided against one. The problem is of their own making. They must now explain how they will ensure the consistency in standards that is necessary to protect not only the responsible landlord but the vulnerable tenant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. James Clappison)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's explanation. I felt that we were going over old ground, particularly on local government and over-centralisation. It is generally sensible to retain a degree of flexibility. My hon. Friend the Minister of State told the Committee of the proposal to allow local authorities to devise their own schemes for approval. That is welcome. It is also sensible that if local authorities can adopt a scheme without the Secretary of State's approval, they should be able to choose from a variety of schemes; flexibility in the model scheme will enable local authorities to reflect local circumstances. The amendment would take away from local authorities a significant degree of flexibility and choice.<br><br>
As for the fire escape order, we suggest that it applies to HMOs that are registrable, but only for properties of three or more storeys. That is not inconsistent, because fire safety checks will be made when houses are registered. The fire escape safety scheme will still apply in places without a registration scheme to ensure that all high-risk properties are safe. I do not want to go over old ground again about centralisation and trusting local authorities. It is a sensible provision of flexibility. I urge the Committee to resist the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Hanson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to speak on this amendment, but having heard the Under-Secretary's response, I remain dissatisfied with the answer to the questions raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Burden) on the effect of such schemes in Wales.<br><br>
Future Secretaries of State—from whatever party—will operate different model registration schemes based
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0172">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 297</span>
on different levels of consultation for various parts of the country. The Minister of State did not say whether the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales, would introduce a different model registration scheme in Wales. I shall give a clear example of how important that difference might be in my locality. The hon. Member for City of Chester represents a constituency that I can reach in 15 minutes from my constituency. He represents a seat in England; I represent a seat in Wales. I can open my bedroom window in the morning and see England and the spires of Liverpool, yet I live in Wales. The two countries are close together.<br><br>
It is unacceptable that the Under-Secretary may introduce regulations more detrimental to my constituents than those introduced in England by the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, the hon. Member for Hertsmere. The level of flexibility that appears to be provided by the Bill—given that different model schemes may be prepared—is unacceptable. I want to receive a clear answer today about whether it is the Welsh Office's intention to introduce a different model scheme from that of the Department of the Environment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend probably should not want to give way to me. I ask mischievously: surely the Welsh scheme ought to be in Welsh? It is not much use issuing a scheme in Welsh in parts of England.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may be wrong, Mrs. Winterton, but I think that you chaired the Committee which considered the Welsh Language Bill, on which I and the Under-Secretary of State for Wales served—oh, I am told that you did not. Certainly, we in Wales want regulations schemes to be issued in Welsh—that is a requirement placed upon the Government by the Welsh Language Act 1993. But that does not undermine the argument about the content of different model schemes. Model schemes can be the same in different languages. We do not need different model schemes.<br><br>
Even in my part of the world, there is a need for uniformity of treatment, although I would not want Welsh local authorities or individuals to have a lack of freedom to express their own will. Perhaps if we had a Welsh Assembly, it would be appropriate for it to determine the model schemes, but at present it is incumbent on the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment to tell us whether, given the difference in consultation, there will be different schemes in Wales.<br><br>
I can see the Under-Secretary itching to get in, but just before he does, may I also say that we have not had sufficient explanation of how different model schemes would operate. I can think of a number of local authorities in my area that have a mix of seaside and large urban conurbation, or others which have a rural area and large urban conurbation, or seaside and rural areas. My constituency contains seaside resorts
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 298</span>
similar to Scarborough, but it has an industrial belt greatly different from the seaside part of the same borough. The flexibility that appears to exist and the different model schemes that could be prepared will create confusion between neighbouring authorities and countries, and will lead to the sort of situation that my hon. Friend the Member for Northfield described, in which different standards will be applied in different parts of the country, and perhaps in neighbouring authorities. I would certainly welcome a clearer definition of what is meant by "different model schemes" and why the amendment should be rejected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to criticise the hon. Gentleman for standing up for Welshness, the distinctive nature of Wales, and so forth, but I think that if he reflects a little more carefully—I appreciate that his speech was an immediate reaction—he will appreciate that many of the points that he made support the existence of a flexible scheme. He should bear it in mind that local authorities will choose the scheme. It will be up to them to choose the scheme that suits them. The hon. Gentleman looks unhappy about that, but I think that he would be the first to accept that many local authorities in Wales are often concerned that their local circumstances are met in legislation and schemes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that it would be fore local authorities to decide on a scheme, but under the Bill, if the local authority scheme does not match the model set by the Secretary of State, it will be rejected. Proposed new section 346B states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may prepare model registration schemes… A registration scheme which conforms to a model scheme… does not require confirmation".</p></blockquote>
The implication is that if it does not conform, it will require the Secretary of State's approval.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should bear in mind the difference between the ordinary registration and the special control legislation. It has been established that local authorities can devise their own schemes and seek confirmation from the Secretary of State. The schemes before the Committee are flexible. A local authority can choose a particular model scheme without needing to seek the Secretary of State's confirmation. It is desirable that there should be such flexibility in the scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may wish to return to the matter after the Under-Secretary has clarified the point that I am about to put to him. Will he elaborate on the means of escape order? Does he envisage that a property that could be subject to a means of escape order could also be subject to an exclusion under the Bill? That is different from saying that everything that is subject to one order must be registered. Could a property be excluded? The Minister may wish to take advice on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman said earlier about notifying the wrong
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0173">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 299</span>
Minister's private office. It was fair of him to say that. I understand that he seeks accurate information and wants a considered and careful response, so I shall write to him and set out the position precisely.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Under-Secretary's response. I hope that that will clarify matters with respect to the means of escape order. Sadly, however, it will not clarify the position with respect to the amendment. There is still a major contradiction in the Government's argument. They have said consistently that they want to trust local authorities. If the amendment were accepted, local authorities could apply to the Minister for an exemption from the model scheme. That could be agreed. In other words, the initiative would come from local authorities, if they thought that the model scheme did not apply in their area.<br><br>
Without the amendment, Ministers are reserving themselves the right to say to local authorities, "We know better then you what is right for your area. We do not want just one model scheme. We want different model schemes, because we know the position in every corner of the country." That is a centralising attitude that is likely to lead to inconsistency and confusion. We recognise that there may be different numbers of applications for registration around the country, but there should be no part of the country where there are different standards of protection for tenants and responsible landlords. For that reason we wish to press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to have his wires crossed. On Tuesday the Opposition moved an amendment that would impose a single scheme across the country, but with an exemption that would allow an authority to opt out entirely from it. There is inconsistency in their position. I invite my hon. Friends to resist the amendment.</span></p>

<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 189, in page 36, line 33, after 'is' insert
<br><blockquote><p>'considered by the local housing authority to be'.</p></blockquote>
Our amendment is intended to help the Government ensure that what we believe to be their intention is put into practice. As drafted, the clause could be open to misinterpretation as allowing wider appeal to the courts against the decision of a local authority. We believe that the Government intended that the local authority decide whether a person who controls or manages a house of multiple occupation is a fit and proper person. The difficulty with the clause as drafted is that a person who thought that local authority had decided wrongly could challenge the decision in the courts simply on the ground that the local authority's view of who was a fit and proper person ought to be set aside and the court's view substituted. We doubt that that is what the Government intended. Our amendment would narrow the possibilities of such a challenge in the courts. The phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"considered by the local housing authority to be"</p></blockquote>
would, if included in the clause, confirm that the decision as to who was a fit and proper person was made by the local authority and that the only possible challenge in a court could be as to whether the local housing authority had reached an unreasonable decision. The onus would not be on the court to substitute its view for that of the local authority but on an individual to ask the court to determine whether the authority had acted unreasonably in reaching that decision. The only challenge would therefore be through judicial review—a challenge under the Wednesbury test as to whether the local housing authority had acted, and decided, in a reasonable manner rather than as to whether the court should decide differently about a person's being fit and proper.<br><br>
The amendment tabled by the hon. Members for Blackpool, North and for Scarborough causes us little difficulty. Its implication is clear. It is the local housing authority that will be entitled to take account of any matter when it is deciding: therefore, the authority decides about whether a person is fit and proper.<br><br>
The third amendment is simple and reasonable. It would provide that a local housing authority would be entitled to obtain from interested persons, including those living in a property, information that was necessary or reasonably required by it. Under present
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0174">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 301</span>
legislation, a local authority can require people to provide information about whether a house or building is liable for registration. It can also require information on the particulars to be entered in the register, but not about an individual to decide whether he is a "fit and proper" person. If a local authority is to take a decision that stands the Wednesbury test of reasonableness, it must have all the necessary information. For that, it will require powers to ensure that individuals provide the appropriate information. We hope that the Government will accept this helpful amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Elletson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I draw the Committee's attention to the important amendment No. 249.<br><br>
In my constituency there have been five drug-related deaths and one murder in the past year or so in a house in multiple occupation. It is staggering that the landlord is still conducting his business and, when the house is shut down, he may move somewhere else—perhaps to the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough. Such people should not be allowed to run HMOs; at the very least, a local authority should be able to beg whatever evidence it can from local people, from residents of hostels and from the police and thus take a decision on a informed basis. The purpose of the amendment is to draw the Minister's attention to the problem of identifying a landlord as a certain individual, as the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) suggested. The drafting of the amendment may not be ideal, but I hope that the Minister will take it, and the rest of the group, extremely seriously, and table an appropriate amendment on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sykes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North.<br><br>
I endorse the views of Scarborough borough council, which has worked closely with me on the Bill. It must be explicit in deciding the "fit and proper person" issue that the housing authority can consider a person's previous track record on the management of HMOs which have caused disturbance in a neighbourhood. I hope that the Minister will consider carefully what I ask, because there would be not point, for example, in a hostel in Scarborough being taken over by someone from Manchester with just as bad a record as the previous owner.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I add my support to amendment No. 249. We are all anxious that the Bill should enable local authorities to deal with matters once and for all. The last thing we want is for the problem merely to be moved somewhere else.<br><br>
I support the amendment, too, because it would involve the local authority. We have discussed the role of local authorities many times and hon. Members seem to change their minds on the subject. I was disappointed by the Government's view in that respect on the definition of housing needs and the right to buy.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 302</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Gwilym Jones)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I broadly support the purpose of the amendments. I would expect local authorities to consider all the available information about an HMO manager in deciding whether he is fit and proper to run such a property. Local authorities are usually good at establishing networks to exchange information and to report widely evidence of unsuitability. Local authorities are usually the prosecuting authorities in HMO cases, and they are best placed to organise that exchange.<br><br>
In practice, as "fit and proper" is not defined, refusal of an application for registration on that ground will always be a matter for the local housing authority's consideration. I appreciate the substance of the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and endorsed by my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough. A local authority's judgment must be backed up by a written statement of reasons and the decision is subject to appeal through the county court. It would clearly be helpful for a local authority to ask the people who know for information and amendment No. 190 is intended to facilitate that. I am, therefore, prepared to consider whether the obligation to provide information should be extended to owners and managers but not to residents of the HMO who would be placed in an invidious position by such a responsibility. The Committee will appreciate that there is room for apprehensions that there might be reprisals by the worst HMO landlords.<br><br>
Without disagreeing with the substance of the case argued by my hon. Friends on amendment No. 249, I do not believe that the amendment is necessary—nor is amendment No. 189—as such exchanges of information between authorities are clearly possible under the Bill's provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not clear at the start of the Under-Secretary's remarks whether he was agreeing to accept amendment No. 189. From what he said, he seemed to be agreeing with it, but he did not say that he would accept it. On the question of providing information, I am sympathetic to concerns about pressures that individuals might face, but if a local authority is trying to find out whether someone is fit and proper to manage a house in multiple occupation, much of that evidence will come from residents of the properties. If they cannot say what they think, the local authority will be in an almost impossible position. Under section 350 of the Housing Act 1985, there is a requirement for people living in a property to give information to the local authority when it is trying to ascertain whether that property is fit to be registered. Individuals living in such a property can be forced to provide information that is contrary to the interests of a rogue landlord, but the Under-Secretary says that it would not be fair to force individuals to provide information about landlords of such properties because it might put them in an invidious position. I cannot see the difference between the two sets of circumstances. The Government should want to strengthen the requirements to ensure that local authorities receive the

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 303</span>
information that is needed to show whether landlords are fit and proper and behave reasonably.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Elletson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 250, in page 36, line 39, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(d) to require as a condition of granting the application for registration that adequate management arrangements are in pace.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 251, in page 37, line 38, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(c) to revoke the registration if the conditions attached to the granting of the registration under paragraph (d) of section 348(1) has not been met.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Elletson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments address a major concern expressed to me by many constituents—the problem of on-site management at many hostels. I have received a vast number of complaints from local businesses saying that many of the worst HMOs have no effective on-site management. Those places are subject to the worst problems, including criminal activity, drug abuse, abusive and foul language, antisocial behaviour and other things that could be reduced by responsible management on site. Perhaps there might be a supervisor, caretaker-manager or owner on site.<br><br>
The proposed registration scheme specifies information to be included on an application. It must include the name and address of the person who is managing the houses and anyone else who is an owner, lessee or mortgagee of the house or any part of it. In the case of a body corporate, the address should be the registered address of the secretary or other principal officer.<br><br>
There are some circumstances in which we need to ensure that adequate management arrangements are in place before an application for a house in multiple occupancy is registered. Local authorities should be able to revoke permission for registration in certain
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 304</span>
circumstances when it is clear that adequate management arrangements are not in place. That is what the amendments seek to do.<br><br>
In constituencies such as mine and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough, the amendments would go to the nub of the problem we face. I shall quote some correspondence to me from people who are totally exasperated by having to live next to some of the worst houses in multiple occupation when they are run as small businesses. One lady wrote that the owners of the property next door
<br><blockquote><p>"do not have to suffer the consequences of their commercial activities, having moved out to Spain … leaving the residents of Maitland Avenue to suffer the social pollution of their commercial enterprise whilst they enjoy the profits in the sun."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sykes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made an excellent point about commercial enterprise. Does he agree that many factories up and down the land are obliged to have management arrangements for health and safety? Should not exactly the same be required in the case that he quotes?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Elletson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The situation is similar but there is a case for going much further and saying that many HMOs, particularly larger ones, should have on-site management or that a local authority should be able to assess what management arrangements would be adequate.<br><br>
Another lady wrote to me about the property next door to her. She said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The whole property is in a disgusting state of repair with windows out back and front; they have been out approx. 2 yrs and the front bay window has been broken about 6 weeks. The Landlord only cares about collecting his money not repairs. If I wanted to sell my property people would take one look at the state of 21 Cheltenham Rd., and quickly drive away."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the conditions described in that constituent's letter could apply to premises containing only four occupants? Are we saying that such premises should be covered while those with only four occupants should not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Elletson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to refer to an issue that we discussed at our previous sitting, but a local authority should have the right to insist that adequate management arrangements are in place.<br><br>
The lady to whom I was referring continued in her letter:
<br><blockquote><p>"This landlord lives right away from this property. He and his wife can sleep soundly away from it whilst I and my husband have all the worry and upset. We have to phone the police when there is rowing and fighting and when music is still blasting at 4.00 in the morning. Then we have to apologise to our Holiday Makers.</p></blockquote>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
EXISTING REGISTRATION SCHEMES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 181, in page 39, line 35, leave out subsection (4).<br><br>
Under subsection (4), all existing registration schemes for HMOs will cease to exist within two years of the Bill's enactment, unless they were revoked earlier by the local authority. We do not believe that that should be imposed on local authorities. The amendment would allow existing schemes to continue, to be replaced or revoked only when local authorities choose.<br><br>
During our proceedings, the Government have been arguing against a centrist policy, saying that they want to give local authorities the flexibility to meet the needs of their areas. That was their reason for not following the wishes of the majority of local authorities to create a national, mandatory licensing scheme for HMOs—the Government have turned their face from that.<br><br>
Clause 66(4) is another example either of the Government's split personality or of their inability to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 306</span>
draft a Bill correctly, as it will impose on local authorities precisely what the Government have been arguing that they are against. It will take away from local authorities the powers genuinely to be able to implement the schemes necessary to produced the best results. Labour Members have pointed out that the proposed registration schemes will in many areas cover few HMOs and will exclude HMOs where local authorities consider that the risks are serious. In such circumstances, local authorities would prefer to continue their own schemes.<br><br>
The Government argue for the removal of bureaucracy from local authorities and central Government, but subsection (4) will add an enormous bureaucratic burden on local authorities which are—as we have established during our proceedings—extremely overstretched in the provision of housing. It is absurd that, when there is a scheme that is producing the desired effects for tenants of HMOs and which is safeguarding them and their interests, a local authority will be asked to dump the scheme and that those who implement it will be burdened with new papers, schemes and examinations. That could have a serious impact on tenants of HMOs.<br><br>
Every Committee member—whether they have spoken for or against the Government's proposals—could present the Committee with endless lists of extraordinary talent of landlords of HMOs to delay entry to local authorities, to delay implementing orders and to delay answering letters. Bad landlords expend much energy to avoid spending any money on improving their properties and making them safe for their tenants. The measure will be a green light to those landlords to delay even further.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Blackpool, North has told us of the difficulties that his constituents are experiencing because the manager or owner of an HMO is in Spain. There are similar cases in my constituency, although the country involved is not Spain. There is an endless process of writing letters, which are not responded to. The measure is a green light to those owners who have no intention of implementing the necessary requirements imposed by local authorities. If they knew that existing registration schemes, under which orders had perhaps already been issued to them, were to be automatically terminated, they would simply delay even further. Again, that would have a serious impact on the tenants of those properties. They are already insecure, and many of them do not know whether they have any rights. It is virtually impossible for them to have a face-to-face meeting with the owner or manager of the property in which they live. They, too, would be deeply insecure.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
If the purpose of the Bill is to create better housing standards, especially for houses in multiple occupation where, as we know, housing standards are appalling and lamentable—and I am prepared to believe that the Government are genuine and honest in this—I hope that they will look favourably on the amendment. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0177">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 307</span>
Government must consider the fact that those owner-managers who manage their properties correctly and work closely with local authorities will face an additional bureaucratic and possibly economic burden. The amendment would be of enormous benefit to all concerned, and I hope that the Government agree to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be of advantage to the Committee to consider the amendment in the context of clause 66 as a whole. Under clause 66(4), if an existing registration scheme is not revoked, it will lapse automatically two years after the Bill comes into force. We intend to give local authorities sufficient time to decide whether to use the new powers and, if so, how to set up the necessary systems to operate them under the scheme that we propose. In the interests of consistency, that will ensure that after two years only the new sort of registration scheme will be operating.<br><br>
The amendment would enable registration schemes set up under existing provisions to run indefinitely—not just for two years—in areas where they have not been revoked, while the new schemes that we propose would operate in other areas.<br><br>
It is somewhat strange to be responding to the debate and to the points raised by the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson)—which the Opposition spokesman, no doubt, supports—having been chastised this morning for not proposing a scheme that, in the words of the hon. Member for Northfield, should be as simple and consistent as possible and in the previous sitting by the hon. Member for Greenwich for not proposing a scheme consistent with national mandatory standards, because the amendment would allow existing schemes to continue indefinitely alongside the schemes that we propose. I remind the Opposition that, by allowing existing local authority schemes to continue, those local authorities would not have the advantage of stronger control provisions, higher fees from houses that have been registered and all the renewal and revocation powers which we consider to be important. There would be built-in inconsistency. The amendment is strange given the arguments that Opposition Members have advanced in earlier debates, and I resist it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has entirely failed to understand the amendment. It is designed to prevent the Government restricting the ability of local authorities to register houses in multiple occupation, many of which are disgusting fire-traps that will no longer come within the remit when the Bill's restrictive clauses come into effect. The amendment would allow greater flexibility; those authorities which want to continue to operate their current registration schemes could do so. The amendment would allow local authorities discretion, and it is extraordinary that the Minister does not accept it.<br><br>
Clearly, the Minister has not been persuaded by the eloquence of my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson). Earlier, the housing Minister
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 308</span>
quoted "Antony and Cleopatra". My hon. Friend was an extremely distinguished Cleopatra—indeed, one of the most distinguished of our time. I cannot help but quote an appropriate phrase from "Antony and Cleopatra", which she has demonstrated to good effect this morning and in previous interventions
<br><blockquote><p>"Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Her infinite variety".</p></blockquote>
She has made a most persuasive case. I am disappointed the Ministers are not prepared to accept it.<br><br>
Let me add a further consideration. Subsection (4) provides that schemes will be allowed to operate for a further two years. That takes us beyond the general election. Let me put this gently. If the general election results in a Conservative Government returning to office, they can easily bring such schemes to an end. However, if, as we hope and expect, the general election results in a change of Government, who will seek to introduce a national mandatory licensing scheme for all HMOs, the amendment would allow existing schemes to continue and so avoid disruption for local authorities. There are strong pragmatic reasons for leaving out subsection (4), and enabling local authorities to continue with their existing registration schemes. I am entirely unconvinced by Minister's response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I share the feeling of my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich about the Minister's response. If we are to continue with the "Antony and Cleopatra" theme, may I thank him for his words, and say that my reaction to the Minister's response was indeed from that play:
<br><blockquote><p>"He words me, girls, he words me".</p></blockquote>
Nothing in the Minister's reply touched on the essence of that amendment. Indeed, we saw the reappearance of Marsham street man, who has been much maligned recently by the Government. Marsham street man has been reinstated; he knows better than local authorities. The central point of the amendment is that it gives local authorities the ability to choose whether to maintain and retain or to dispense with existing registration schemes. I regret that, in this instance, there is so little accord between the two sides of the Committee that we must press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, as we have covered much of the ground already. The amendments seek simply to give local authorities greater flexibility—a cause espoused earlier by the Under-Secretary.<br><br>
I hope that he will have no difficulty agreeing that local authorities should if necessary, be able to serve further notices within a shorter period than five years, and to vary the period in which specific notices apply, because, inevitably, some works will need attention at different times. If the rhetoric from Conservative Members is anything to go by, the principle of flexibility should be acceptable to the Government. I commend the amendment to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have racked my brains to find anything further from "Antony and Cleopatra", which was my A-level text, so I must resort to "Henry IV part 1", which was my O-level text—both need some refreshment. However, as the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate is no longer present I am spared that. I must reject the amendment of the hon. Member for Greenwich. He wishes to enable a local authority to impose significant repair work upon an owner after a three-year interval. The Government think that a five-year interval is right. Works could cost up to £10,000 and an owner must conform absolutely. We do not want to impose unreasonable burdens provided that owners observe the rules as they stand. I am trying to be as reasonable as the hon. Gentleman, but I am unable to accept his amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are again arguing for flexibility for local authorities, this time in recovering expenses. The amendment would delete the phrase "certain adminsitrative and other"; the proposed new section 352A(1) would read:
<br><blockquote><p>"A local authority may, as a means of recovering expenses incurred…"</p></blockquote>
That is entirely reasonable and sensible. It would not allow local authorities unfettered discretion. I can imagine Ministers conjuring up images of authorities trying to profiteer at the expense of the landlords. The wording would allow local authorities to recover only expenses incurred by them, and the charges would have to be reasonable. Those are two safeguards, but there is a little more flexibility than is provided by the current wording which could allow litigious landlords to challenge the reasonableness of local authority charges if they did not relate to certain administrative expenses. I hope that the Minister will take a more favourable view of this group of amendments which will improve the Bill and add a little genuine flexibility to assist local authorities. We hear much about flexibility but so far the Government have not voted for it. They can prove their concern for discretion for local authorities by agreeing to the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept the hon. Gentleman's amendments. However, I accept his argument that there ought to be appropriate arrangements for recovering certain expenses. We think that in the majority of landlords would negotiate improvements by agreement and that the local housing authority would impose a charge only if a landlord failed to co-operate with an enforcement notice. We think that the Secretary of State should be empowered to set the maximum sum when that happens. There should be an opportunity to recover certain expenses. These would relate to deciding whether to serve a notice, to identifying works to be specified, and to the cost of service itself. We accept that other costs might be incurred by a local housing authority bringing court proceedings. We intend to consult local authorities about setting the amount of charge, thereby ensuring adequate recovery of certain expenses. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>

albeit that he defended the Secretary of State's right to set a maximum charge which would be removed by the third amendment. However, it appears that the Under-secretary will accept none of the amendments. That confirms our fears that while there may be much talk about flexibility for local authorities, it will not be included in the Bill. However, to make progress and to allow time to discuss further important issues, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

DUTY TO KEEP PREMISES FIT FOR NUMBER OF OCCUPANTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 197, in page 41, line 14, after 'occupants)', insert
<br><blockquote><p>'or section 354 (power to limit number of occupants of house)'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it may be convenient to take amendment No. 198, in page 41, line 14, after 'occupants)', insert
<br><blockquote><p>'or section 372 (power to require execution of works to remedy neglect or management)'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments would raise standards and redress the balance between bad landlords and tenants in favour of the tenants, who would have more protection, more rights and greater security when holding tenancies in HMOs.<br><br>
Amendment No. 197 would include overcrowding in relation to the duty on landlords. It would place a duty on managers and owners of houses in multiple occupation so that when a notice is served under section 354 of the Housing Act 1985 by a housing authority, failure to comply with that duty would be a summary offence. That would deter landlords from overcrowding an HMO and take into account the number and condition of facilities, such as means of escape and other fire precautions, in the property. Landlords would have to have adequate facilities for the number of people in the property and tenants would thus have a stronger statutory protection.<br><br>
Under section 354 of the Housing Act 1985, local authorities may make a direction order that limits the number of tenants in the HMO so that there are adequate amenities and fire safety provisions for the number of people living in the property. Sadly, local authorities frequently have to issue direction orders when they take action under section 352, to which the proposed duty in clause 67 refers.<br><br>
The direction order sets a limit, but that does not mean that some tenants who live in the HMO will be evicted. When the limit is set, if or when a tenant leaves, the landlord is forbidden by law from reletting
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 312</span>
the property above the limit set. Amendment No. 197 would amend the clause to ensure that those who live in HMOs would be protected against unscrupulous landlords who cram tenants into houses with cramped living conditions. The amendment would be a strong deterrent; landlords of overcrowded properties would face summary offences.<br><br>
Amendment No. 198 relates to the execution of works in properties and would ensure that the improvements in management advised by the local authority were carried out to give tenants a better environment. The amendment would place a duty on managers and owners of HMOs, so that when a notice is served under section 372 of the Housing Act 1985 by a local housing authority, requiring works to be undertaken on the property, failure to comply would be a summary offence. By means of a duty under the Housing Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation Regulations 1990, the management code applies automatically to all managers of houses in multiple occupation. Any landlord who claims to operate a bona fide business should be aware of the legislative requirements.<br><br>
Amendment No. 198 would give local housing authorities the power to act against poor management practices and would make it a summary offence for landlords to fail to comply with conditions set out in previous Housing Acts. The tenants of HMOs, especially those on shorthold tenancies or short lets, depend on the landlord for basic amenities that many of us take for granted. They need basic hot water supplies, often for shared bathrooms. They need lighting, cleanliness and safety, particularly on shared landings and in shared corridors and entrances. They should have statutory rights to protect them from landlords who fail to provide basic services.<br><br>
Although many landlords abide by management regulations, accessible and are accountable to their tenants and to the local authority, many others provide minimal facilities which they withdraw without notice in their own interests without taking into account tenants' needs. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will have come across examples in which landlords cut off the electricity in common areas to save money, possibly because they have short-term cash flow problems. That leads to hazards such as dark stairways. In many cases shared bathrooms do not have a hot water supply. There are other examples such as the absence of handrails on stairs and guard-ways at the top of stairs, especially where young children live. Rooms may be let in a dirty or unsafe condition.<br><br>
Shorthold tenants in particular suffer from a lack of security, unsettling accommodation and often an imbalance of power in negotiations with the landlord. They need the landlord's support to get a short-term tenancy, but they do not have the statutory backing that amendment No. 198 would provide by enabling local authorities to make poor management practices summary offences.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V005P0I0180">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 313</span>
The extension of the proposed duty of care in clause 69 to situations in which there was a failure of management would go some way towards redressing the balance. The majority of landlords who own, control or manage HMOs have nothing to fear. Most of them are trying to provide decent basic facilities, including reasonable management services, and to have a reasonable number of occupants in a property.<br><br>
The amendments would attack bad landlords who do not provide basic levels of services and who overfill and run down their properties, leaving tenants with little or no protection. Tenants who live in such appalling conditions demand the right to Government intervention and protection. The amendments would allow local authorities to take action against landlords who failed to perform their basic civilised duties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the sentiments and considerations expressed by the hon. Gentleman in moving the amendment, but I invite him to consider the nature and effect of the important duty that we propose to extend to landlords under this clause.<br><br>
Until now, the obligation placed on landlords to provide adequate facilities to make a house in multiple occupation fit for the number of occupants has relied on local housing authority enforcement action. Until the authority discovers an unfit HMO and serves the appropriate section 352 notice, there are no requirements in housing legislation for the landlord to do anything to improve his property.<br><br>
Under subsection 353A(1), for the first time, an HMO landlord or his agent will be under a duty to ensure that the premises are reasonably suitable for the number of occupants so that a local housing authority does not have cause to serve a notice under section 352, requiring him to carry out works. That is an important duty and an extension of the obligations of a landlord. It can have the consequences outlined in clause 69.<br><br>
We are placing the responsibility for ensuring that HMOs are up to standard firmly with the landlord or his agent. It will not simply arise as a response to a section 352 notice.<br><br>
It is important that HMO landlords and their agents know what facilities they should provide and guidance will be offered in that respect in the proposed national code of practice to be approved by the Secretary of State under clause 71.<br><br>
Amendment No. 197 would require an HMO landlord or his agent to ensure that not only is the standard of his property adequate to avoid having a notice served under section 352, but he must also ensure that the local housing authority does not have to take action under section 354 to limit the number of occupants in a house, or part of a house, to prevent the situation occurring in which they would have to serve a notice under section 352 to remedy it. I do not believe that the national code of practice would give such comprehensive advice that in every case a landlord would know exactly how many occupants were appropriate for each particular property.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 314</span>
Therefore, it would be unreasonable for the duty to extend to the need to prevent serving a notice limiting the number of occupants.<br><br>
Amendment No. 198 would require an HMO landlord or his agent to ensure that his property is of adequate standard to avoid having a notice served under section 352. He must also ensure that the local authority does not have to take action under section 372 to require work to be carried out because of a failure to comply with the management regulations. The regulations, which are made by statutory instrument under the powers in section 369, require that accommodation amenities and apparatus must be kept in repair and good order. It is a criminal offence not to comply with these regulations. I therefore believe that, as an offence under the management regulations would already have been committed before a local housing authority served a notice under section 372, it would be unnecessary to amend the Bill to prevent service of this notice under the new duty of care as that would create a second offence for the same action, and the Committee would be reluctant to do that.<br><br>
Like my hon. Friend, the Minister, I have racked my brains to find an appropriate quotation from "Antony and Cleopatra". I am afraid that I can think of only one, and could be turned against me. It is that these are
<br><blockquote><p>"My salad days, when I was green in judgment".</p></blockquote>
I am not so on the amendment; I invite the Committee to resist it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Despite being perhaps the only Member of the House who has a degree in drama—which has been of absolutely no use—I cannot remember anything about "Antony and Cleopatra", so I shall not attempt to address it.<br><br>
I have listened with interest to the Minister. I hope that we raised important points in amendments Nos. 197 and 198. The Minister is aware of our concerns and has addressed some of them. On that note, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 247, in page 41, line 19, leave out 'knowingly'.<br><br>
"Knowingly" is a word that has been, and will continue to be, much discussed. In this context, it describes the offence committed by a person who has control of or manages a house in multiple occupation and who breaches the proposed duty of care in clause 69(1). Removing it would provide an absolute duty.<br><br>
Clause 69 introduces a new duty of care on HMO landlords. It will be their duty, or that of someone managing the house, to ensure that the state of affairs does not arise in which a notice under section 352 of the Housing Act 1985 could be served. In other words, we must ensure that the conditions of the amenities and, most important, the means of escape and the fire precautions do not become so substandard that they warrant statutory action.<br><br>

Clause 69(3) makes it an offence for someone knowingly to fail to comply with the duty. That qualifier is inappropriate and unnecessary. An absolute duty would benefit tenants and bona fide landlords who co-operate with the legislation. They would have no reason to fear summary proceedings.<br><br>
The establishment of an absolute offence under the duty of care would provide greater, necessary protection for tenants, the majority of whom in houses of multiple occupation have assured short-term lettings. The Minister may argue that that qualifier is necessary to safeguard genuine landlords who are not aware of the requirements placed on them, but genuine landlords should know the requirements and local authorities publicise them, so that is not a reasonable argument. I understand that the Department of the Environment will publish national standards for HMOs—we discussed the code of practice, using powers provided by clause 71. That will be a guide for landlords. I also understand that the Government will not bring the duty of care into operation until the code of practice is published. If so, it means that protection for tenants from dangerous conditions, especially lack of fire escapes, may not materialise for a long time. I want the Minister to clarify that issue, which is extremely important. We all know of horrific stories and dreadful deaths arising from fires in HMO's, so I hope that the Minister will accept that the duty of care should be absolute.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have considerable sympathy with the hon. Lady's amendment. The word "knowingly" has a respectable history in housing legislation. The hon. Member for Greenwich is nodding—knowing his biblical knowledge of housing legislation, that gives me some confidence.<br><br>
I accept that in these circumstances, the word "knowingly" may give a little too much leeway to the landlord, especially when the Government have produced a clear code of practice that has been given adequate publicity. The inclusion of the word "knowingly" may be rather too generous to a landlord who cannot be bothered finding out what he needs to do. Therefore, I shall reconsider the matter. It may be possible to replace the wording so that someone is guilty of an offence if he breaches the code. Reasonable excuse might be a more appropriate expression, so I am willing to reconsider the matter.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for City of Chester, having exhausted Antony and Cleopatra, has given me a quotation from Hamlet:

In case my hon. Friend turns from being a prince into a gravedigger, I shall draw my conclusions to a close.</span></p>

MEANS OF ESCAPE FROM FIRE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 199, in page 41, line 40, after first '(4)', insert '(a).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 216, in page 41, line 40, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(b) In subsection (4) (orders) after "different areas, and" insert—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"(aa) in particular, shall apply the duty under subsection (2) to houses in multiple occupation which are two or more storeys in height; and".'.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 244, in page 41, line 40, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(4A) After subsection (4) insert—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"(4A) An order under subsection (2) or (2A) shall distinguish between cases or descriptions of case on the basis of risk to safety, health or welfare, and on no other basis.".'.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause raises the important issue of the duties on housing authorities to require adequate means of escape from fire. The Government made it clear that they will extend the current duty, but have said that it will be limited to certain categories of HMOs, specifically only those with three or more storeys. Our amendment would extend the duty to cover HMOs of two or more storeys. The evidence in support of such a proposal is overwhelming.<br><br>
The Government's estimates in their consultation paper show that only about 50,000 more HMOs will be added to the current number of about 20,000, which fall within the ambit of present controls. The consultation paper states that the present arrangements only catch
<br><blockquote><p>"the very biggest HMOs (we estimate about 20,000)".</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 3.6 of the paper states that the Government's best estimate is that
<br><blockquote><p>"there could be about 50,000"</p></blockquote>
properties that are covered by the new duty.<br><br>
It is not clear whether the 50,000 properties are additional properties or whether there will be an additional 30,000 properties on top of the existing 20,000. I should welcome clarification from the Minister of whether the Government mean 50,000 properties in total or an additional 50,000. When that figure is compared, however, with the 6000,000 HMOs that the Government accept exist throughout the country, one can see that the Bill is dealing with only a tiny proportion of them. Overwhelming evidence shows that fire tragedies occur only too often in two-storey HMOs. I shall give the Committee a few harrowing examples.<br><br>

In the London borough of Brent, the Brent Private Tenants Rights Group has identified a series of fires between November 1993 and November 1995, all of which occurred in houses of two storeys or less. For example, 13 Berkhampstead avenue in Wembley was a two-storey house with six occupants. Two young women on the first floor died after a fire started on the ground floor; 26 Keswick gardens in Wembley, a two-storey house with five occupants, suffered one fatality; a fire broke out on the ground floor at 45 Chipstead gardens in NW2, a two-storey house with four occupants, and a tenant in a ground floor room was killed; 78 Olive road, NW2, a two-storey house with five occupants, was gutted. There were no fatalities, but one occupant suffered burns. That happened to properties of two storeys during two years in one borough. Those properties would fall outside the Government's proposals. If I had more time this morning, I could list endless examples from other areas.<br><br>
We must protect the interests of people who are at risk of fire, knowing that the incidence of fire in multiple-occupied houses is far greater than in other types of housing. According to the Campaign for Bedsit Rights, people living in multi-occupied houses have 28 times greater risk of suffering from serious fire. How can the Government restrict their controls to properties of three or more storeys, when it is clear from evidence throughout the country that there is a serious risk of fire in many two-storey properties? The amendment is crucial. I hope that we will not hear a few emollient words from the Government, followed by a refusal to accept it. It is probably one of the most important amendments that will be tabled during our proceedings. It is about saving lives and I hope that the Government will accept it.</span></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to amendment No. 244 which would achieve a similar result as that outlined by the hon. Member for Greenwich. I concur with the comments that he has made so far. Subsection 2 and 2(A) of section 365 of the Housing Act 1985 give the Secretary of State power to make an order placing a statutory duty on local housing authorities to require fire safety provisions in specified houses in multiple occupation. The Government have announced that they will use that power to extend the current duty, but, as we heard today from the hon. Member for Greenwich and as we have heard at previous sittings, several categories of HMOs will not be covered.<br><br>
Amendment No. 244 would require the Secretary of State to base his decision on the scope of an assessment of the risk to tenants "safety, health or welfare" in different types of HMOs. Fires have occurred in many sorts of HMOs that will be excluded. I hope that the Minister can reassure me about the assessments that I understand his Department is carrying out. I realise that the Department is carrying out assessments of the risk of fire, but will that be a full assessment of all HMOs? Who will undertake that assessment? It would be appropriate if the Committee was kept informed of the results of that assessment.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 318</span>
What is the timetable? We know that the Secretary of State will introduce statutory instruments to lay down the types of HMOs to be covered by the extended statutory duty, but will the categories of HMOs in the statutory instruments be based on the results of the study? It is a terribly important matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Greenwich asked me not to use emollient words and then reject the amendment, so I shall reject it without using emollient words. The hon. Gentleman accepts that the amendment goes to the heart of the Bill. He wishes the Bill to include all HMOs of two storeys, but that would include virtually every HMO in the country because there are very few HMOs of one storey. In a sense, the amendment would make it a bungalow clause.<br><br>
There is a difference of opinion. I believe that the amendment goes too far and imposes too great a burden on local authorities. It would risk taking out of the sector landlords who are quite properly performing a necessary function—an argument we have had before. I am sorry to say that I cannot accept it. As the hon. Member for Christchurch said, we are trying to define a research project on fire. It will take time, because the researchers will want to examine real incidents and to draw practical conclusions. It is not a purely academic exercise, but a practical study. As the hon. Member for Greenwich said, we intend to cover a wider category of HMOs by making a new order. The current proposal, on which we shall consult further, is to consult all HMOs that might be required to be registered, which will all be three storeys high. The total number of properties then covered would be 50,000. I cannot accept the hon. Gentleman's amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Minister about those statutory instruments. He did not adequately answer my question. He said that the study would take a long time. Does he mean that changes made in the near future would not take account of those studies?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For anything done in the near future, that must be the case. However, we would not hesitate to amend statutory instruments in the light of research findings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed with the Minister's answer. He knows perfectly well that there are many well-documented examples of fires in two-storey HMOs. By setting the cut-off point at three storeys, he is deliberately excluding properties that he knows to be a fire risk. That is simply unacceptable.<br><br>
I accept entirely the risk-assessment approach. If the Minister had been willing to say that he would encourage authorities to look at those HMOs that are regarded as the greatest fire risks, whether of two or three storeys, we would have accepted it. His refusal to take a flexible approach and to allow proper controls over two-storey properties that are known to be fire risks, will condemn people to die during the next few

years. We cannot accept that. We shall vote against it. When we introduce a national licensing scheme for HMOs, we shall ensure that those properties—those terrible fire traps, whether of two storeys or more—will be covered.</span></p>
