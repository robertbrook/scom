<p>Short title, commencement and extent, 875.</p>
<p>Transfer to university courts of certain universities of power to appoint principals, 869, 871, 872.</p>
<p><b>Chairman:</b></p>
<p>Affirmative resolutions are required to be put to and approved by the House. The negative resolution procedure allows hon. Members to put down a Prayer. Statutory Instruments can be subject to a decision of the House in both cases, 774.</p>
<p>Amendments, discussing of together, 52, 93, 110, 141–2, 218, 227, 245, 272, 325–6, 369, 372, 437, 446–7, 475, 540, 547, 556–7, 586, 600, 603–4, 609, 617, 649, 651. 692, 710–11, 715, 716, 731, 735, 745, 756, 759, 773, 776, 777, 789, 803, 809, 817–18, 828, 841, 860, 861, 865, 873, 874.</p>
<p>A Minister of the Crown when replying to a debate, is entitled to read a departmental brief, 191.</p>
<p>An invitation to hon. Members to Speak is out of order, because every Committee Member has the right to speak when he catches my eye, 193.</p>
<p>If wrecking amendments were tabled, they would not be selected, and normally are not allowed on the amendment paper, 471.</p>
<p>It is a well known practice both in the House and in Committee that the civil servants in his department aquaint the Minister with points about which he may not be aware at the time, 85.</p>
<p>It is not in order for the Committee to discuss the setting up of Committees or any matters of that nature, 431.</p>
<p>It is quite in order for any hon. Member to walk from or come into the Committee room at any time during the Committee's proceedings, 443.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Chair to select amendments for debate 24.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker has no authority over what happens in Committee, 91.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should indicate that interventions are intended to be short, 10.</p>
<p>Thanks to, 911–14.</p>
<p>The Bill has a Clause 1, and there could be, or may not be, a Clause 1 stand part debate. That is entirely at the discretion of the Chair, and depends on the conduct of the Members of the Committee, 45.</p>
<p>The Bill has had a Second Reading in the House, it must proceed in Committee, the purpose of this Committee is to try to amend the Bill, if need be, 28.</p>
<p>The Chairman's provisional selection of amendments is made by the Chair, the Government or Opposition can always discuss the matter with the Chairman before the Committee commences, 88.</p>
<p>The Chair's duty is to see that the Bill is discussed adequately to protect minority interests as well as the Government's rights and this the Chair will do, 47.</p>
<p>The Question before the Committee is that the Bill be considered in a certain order … the only reason … for changing the normal order is to suit the convenience of the Committee in relating the Clauses to the Schedules, 41.</p>
<p>The rule in Committee is the same as in the House. One is allowed to use fairly fulsome notes, but it is out of order to read an entire speech, 191.</p>
<p>The Speaker is bound by the same rules as the Chairman in a Committee. Neither the speaker nor hon. Members can refer to anyone in the public gallery, 537.</p>
<p>When a group of amendments is selected, only the first amendment is moved. The Chair has the discretion to allow another amendment to be moved, 87.</p>
<p>When amendments are grouped, it is in order for hon. Gentlemen before debating them to tell the Chair which amendments they would prefer to have Divisions on, 89.</p>
<p>When the Chair considers that a Motion has been adequately debated it accepts the closure motion. 40.</p>

<p><b>Chairman:</b></p>
<p>Amendments, discussing of together, 59, 86, 186, 188, 201, 298, 301, 315, 349, 418, 420, 439, 445, 516, 517, 519, 548, 636, 637, 641, 650, 664, 706.</p>
<p>I also draw attention to the fact that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule it is not my intention to call manuscript amendments, 4.</p>
<p>I hope that hon. Members will in future use the normal Parliamentary language and not the personal pronoun " you ", 471.</p>
<p>Interruptions should be short and relevant, 384.</p>
<p>It does not matter what newspaper it is unless the hon. Gentleman is reading it for the purposes of the debate, it is out of order to read a newspaper, 302.</p>
<p>It is not in order to refer to members of the other House in other than respectable terms, 305.</p>
<p>It is not the custom of the Chair to give reasons why amendments are not selected, 419.</p>
<p>It is out of order to refer to the absence of hon. Members in order to prolong the detail, 40.</p>
<p>It is perfectly possible for the Chair to accept verbal amendments. I hasten to add that it may not always do so, 264.</p>
<p>It would be quite without precedent for someone to drop down dead in the Committee. One may become seriously ill, but the process of dying always takes place elsewhere, 261.</p>
<p>Thanks to, 746.</p>
<p>The Chair is responsible for ordering the Committee … 390.</p>
<p>There is a limit to how far the honourable Member can refer to the individual expenditure of individual authorities, 368.</p>
<p>There is a provision as to the way the Chair casts its vote, but certainly not for the status quo, 609.</p>
<p>When amendments have been discussed already, they should be referred to only superficially in a stand part debate, 105.</p>
<p>When the Bill receives Royal Assent it has nothing to do with the amendment, 206.</p>
<p>When the Chair understands, it is assumed that other members of the Committee understand, 288.</p>
