	<p>	<b>Chairman:</b></p>
	<p>Committee Procedure:</p>
	<p>A cross-reference to the Financial Memorandum is perfectly in order. When it becomes a major topic of debate it is out of order, 409, 410, 411.</p>
	<p>Adjournment Motion not acceptable, 521,522, 762.</p>
	<p>Amendments:</p>
	<p>Discussing of together, 57, 97, 103,125, 143, 151, 218, 277, 325, 383, 391, 403, 405, 445, 447, 455–7, 472, 473, 495, 496, 513, 529–30,565, 648, 656, 691, 694, 792, 801,850, 879, 886, 895, 897, 919, 945,977–8, 979, 1003, 1062, 1094, 1103,1109, 1115, 1123, 1152.</p>
	<p>Out or order, 1082.</p>
	<p>Selection of, 11.</p>
	<p>Any hon. Member may move a Sittings motion, 756.</p>
	<p>As an hon. Member has spoken after leave has been sought to withdraw an amendment, I have to put the Question on the Amendment, 51, 52, 53, 54.</p>
	<p>By allowing the debate to go a little further I have the power under Standing Order No. 48 to cut down the debate on the Question "That the Clauses stand part of the Bill", 33, 53, 144.</p>
	<p>Committee:</p>
	<p>Cannot sit this afternoon because notice of such a motion has not been given, 757.</p>
	<p>Has no power to summon any Member or official of the House, 39.</p>
	<p>Must follow a similar procedure to that which is adopted on Second Reading, 765, 766.</p>
	<p>Cannot give a hypothetical ruling, 1082.</p>
	<p>Cannot take two motions at the same time, 43–4</p>
	<p>Financial Resolution will need to be altered when it comes back to the Floor of the House because the new clauses are not covered by it, 1142.</p>
	<p>I am of the opinion that the principle of the Clause and any matters arising have been adequately discussed in the course of the debate on the amendments thereto, 260.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1238">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<p>I am prepared to accept a wider debate on the amendment and have no "Clause stand part" debate, 554.</p>
	<p>I have no power as Chairman of this Committee to send for Ministers or to make Ministers say things they do not intend to say, 491.</p>
	<p>I have no power to force the Minister to make a statement, 521.</p>
	<p>I have no power to insist that the Lord Advocate comes to this Committee, 599.</p>
	<p>If debate on the amendments could be kept as narrow as possible, it would be helpful, 318.</p>
	<p>If it is decided that papers are not available, my ruling would be that we can postpone the clause—provided that there has not been an amendment agreed to it, 43.</p>
	<p>It is unusual to have to call a Minister to order, 290.</p>
	<p>Member, Members</p>
	<p>Cannot raise a point on an amendment that has not been proposed, 523.</p>
	<p>Cannot second the withdrawal of an amendment, 52.</p>
	<p>Getting wide of the Amendment, 177, 223, 584.</p>
	<p>Going very wide of the subject of the debate, 631, 1020, 1101.</p>
	<p>Must not be referred to by name, 274.</p>
	<p>Not to criticise the Chair, 6.</p>
	<p>Not to make a Second Reading debate, 19.</p>
	<p>Not to start discussing the merits of the amendments, 8.</p>
	<p>Reminded we are discussing a narrow amendment, 996.</p>
	<p>To relate his remarks to the amendment, 251, 477, 549–50.</p>
	<p>New Clauses, discussing of together, 810, 817.</p>
	<p>Not in order to adduce an argument on New Clause 1, 421.</p>
	<p>Not necessary for Chair to give reasons why Amendment is out of order, 1082.</p>
	<p>	<i>Sub judice</i> rule does not apply to Bills, 594.</p>
	<p>The business of this Committee is to proceed with the Committee stage of this Bill, 490, 783.</p>
	<p>The Clerk is not allowed to speak in the Committee, 1184–5.</p>
	<p>This is a Committee of the House, and it has instructions to proceed, 754, 755, 756, 761, 762.</p>
	<p>Under Standing Order 65(3) I have power to accept the motion without debate, 648.</p>
	<p>What is taking place in other Committees should not be discussed in this Committee, 762, 770, 778, 779, 780–1.</p>
	<p>When an hon. Member has once declared an interest that is good enough for the rest of the proceedings, 23.</p>
	<p>When the clause is reprinted, it will be put right, 1170.</p>
	<p>Wrong for hon. Members to interrupt from a seated position, 612.</p>

	<p>Committee Procedure:</p>
	<p>Amendment cannot be withdrawn, because it was moved by an hon. Member who is not currently present, 116–17.</p>
	<p>Amendments, discussing of together, 44, 45, 55, 83, 96, 100–1, 107, 170, 195, 207, 238,249, 259–60, 299–303, 403, 414, 469, 489, 500.</p>
	<p>Before the Minister responds, he would be in great danger of my having to direct his attentionto the Standing Order about repetition if he were to be heard again, 402.</p>
	<p>Calling of Members on a Division, 43.</p>
	<p>Clause title does not form part of the Bill and can be altered by various means, 330.</p>
	<p>Committee should restrict itself at this stage to the amendment, 139.</p>
	<p>If no hon. Member rises to his feet, the Chair has no option but to put the Question, 392.</p>
	<p>If the Minister is opening a document to publication, he should offer to lay it in the Library of the House of Commons. He cannot, within the rules of order, offer it to one hon. Member and not to the rest of the House, 173.</p>
	<p>If the Solicitor-General does not give way, the hon. and learned Gentlemen may not intervene, 452.</p>
	<p>If we have a debate now on the main issue, I do not propose to allow a debate again on "clause stand part", 201.</p>
	<p>In Committee there is far less need to interrupt speeches, as members can speak as often as they wish, 443.</p>
	<p>Member, Members:</p>
	<p>Cannot make a speech to a nonexistent amendment, 149.</p>
	<p>Do not refer to other persons present, 277.</p>

	<p>Minister, Ministers:</p>
	<p>Did not quote from document and therefore is not bound to lay it, 208.</p>
	<p>Not possible to go back on the Division, 24, 25–6.</p>
	<p>Question has not been proposed, so the amendment falls, 144.</p>
	<p>Repetition, 63.</p>
	<p>Report stage in Committee can be objected to by 20 Members on the Floor of the House, 296.</p>
	<p>Sittings Motion procedure, 293–4.</p>
	<p>Starred Amendments, calling of, 3.</p>
