<p><b>Chairman:</b></p>
<p>Committee Procedure:</p>
<p>Adjournment motion not in order, 12.</p>
<p>All the amendments are on my list of selection, and amendments tabled by the Government will not be called or moved, 918–19.</p>
<p>Amendments</p>
<p>Discussing of together, 66, 71, 105–6, 117, 213, 214, 215–16, 231–2, 287–8, 291–2, 349, 382, 406, 447, 465, 501, 519, 637–8, 674, 675, 676, 677, 736, 739, 853, 877, 895, 899, 903, 953, 964, 969, 1037–8, 1064, 1086, 1092, 1108, 1119, 1157, 1159, 1173, 1185, 1238, 1243, 1262, 1281, 1349, 1365, 1403, 1409, 1420, 1421, 1436, 1464, 1468, 1475, 1476.</p>
<p>Has not been moved, so it does not have to be withdrawn, 1053.</p>
<p>Is not withdrawn until the Committee has agreed to its withdrawal, 1071.</p>
<p>Not selected, 4, 1064, 1067.</p>
<p>As subsection 2 has not been fully discussed we can have a short debate on clause stand part, 661, 662.</p>
<p>Chair will decide when hon. Members are out of order, 838.</p>
<p>Clauses, discussing of together, 565, 579, 882, 1509, 1535.</p>
<p>I am not required to give any explanations for my selections, 214, 224.</p>
<p>Interventions from a sedentary position are in no way helping the argument, 571.</p>
<p>Interventions should be brief, 932.</p>
<p>It is always a Minister's prerogative to decide when he wishes to move the closure, 633.</p>
<p>It is in Standing Orders that Committee cannot sit between the hours of 1 p.m. and 3.30 p.m., 915.</p>
<p>It is not for me to advise hon. Members on how to deal with matters about which they feel strongly, 1067.</p>
<p>It is up to members of the Committee to table amendments if they wish and the Chair will deal with them in the normal way, 630.</p>
<p>Matter has been sufficiently ventilated and I hope that there will be no further references to it in this debate, 1405.</p>
<p><b>Members, Members:</b></p>
<p>Can choose whether or not to reply, 339, 340.</p>
<p>Cannot amend the Clause at this stage, 1339.</p>
<p>Cannot challenge the ruling of the Chair, 629.</p>
<p>Cannot quote from a speech nor may they refer to a speech other than by inference, 122.</p>
<p>Carrying on a debate from the previous Clause, 1327.</p>
<p>Going wide of the motion before the Committee, 39, 40, 51.</p>
<p>Has been rather wide and repetitious in his arguments, 619.</p>
<p>Quite entitled to engage in discussion with his colleagues, 621.</p>
<p>To address the Chair, 720.</p>
<p>To keep to the Clause, 839, 1017, 1019, 1210.</p>
<p>To refrain from using the pronoun you", 563.</p>
<p>To relate his remarks to the amendment, 340, 453–4, 494, 568, 792, 917, 1112, 1123, 1124, 1188–9.</p>
<p>To relate his remarks to the clause stand part debate, 584–5.</p>
<p>Motion is not amendable, but it can be in order for the hon. Gentleman to put down another motion altering the order of consideration, 56, 57.</p>
<p>No policeman can prevent a Member of Parliament from entering the precincts of the Palace of Westminster, 146.</p>
<p>Not my intention to call manuscript amendments, save in the most exceptional circumstances, 65.</p>
<p>Not to have a clause stand part debate which is purely a rehash of the debate which took place in Committee last year, 979.</p>
<p>Not to have a rehearsal of the arguments adduced in support of the amendments, as that will be regarded by the Chair as tedious repetition, 1301.</p>
<p>Nothing to preclude the Solicitor-General's asking permission to make a Statement to the Committee, 1267.</p>
<p>Point of order cannot be taken now, 225, 628.</p>
<p>Standing Orders enable me to put forthwith the Question, if I am of the opinion that the principle has been adequately discussed, 499–500, 817, 820.</p>
<p>Statements by Ministers were not made in the Committee.</p>
<p>It is therefore not in order to challenge them, 1266.</p>
<p>Tedious repetition: 982, 1388, 1497.</p>
<p>When hon. Member produces arguments that have already been repeated several times in the Committee, 39.</p>
<p>The Chair must see that the proceedings in Committee move along unless there is some reason for obstruction, 919.</p>
<p>The fact that the amendments were not selected does not allow them to be discussed in clause stand part, 1474.</p>
<p>The Government, like other hon. Members, are in the hands of Mr. Speaker in respect of Report stage, 1061.</p>
<p>The principle of detention has already been decided, 245.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V012P0I0999">Image</span>
<p>The principle of the Bill has already been discussed and approved by the House. We are to discuss the principle of the clauses, 37.</p>
<p>The Question before the Committee is whether the clause as it stands should remain in the Bill or whether it should be excised, 1388.</p>
<p>Under Standing Order Nos. 48 and 65 I propose to put the question forthwith, 660–1.</p>
<p>Unless this is a new point of order, I cannot accept it, 631.</p>
<p>We are not aware that there are any persons in the room other than members of the Committee and the Chair, 1163.</p>
<p>We are not discussing the membership of the Committee of Selection, 52.</p>
<p>We cannot deal with the substance of the Bill while discussing the sittings motion, 20, 24.</p>
<p>When a Committee meets at 4.30 p.m. the sitting is open-ended, 634.</p>
<p>When the Chairman is on his feet, an hon. Member must resume his seat, 230.</p>
