	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 19 in page 3, line 39, leave out "subsection (1) of".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Amendment is more than a drafting Amendment. It would have the effect of applying the interpretation of the word "house" in subsection (4) to the whole of Clause 4 and not just to subsection (1). The Committee will recognise that subsection (4) provides that the expression "house" is, in certain circumstances, to include a closed house. My hon. Friends from Glasgow will remember the discussion which we had at the last Sitting about representations which Glasgow Corporation made concerning the counting of houses. Glasgow Corporation are concerned that, having put closing orders on individual houses from time to time, they might not be able to count these houses if they came to deal with an area as a housing treatment area. It is in order to meet this request that I have moved the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 20 in page 3, line 42, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>(5) Where a local authority have declared an area to be a housing treatment area it shall be their duty to bring to the attention of persons residing in the area or owning property therein the action they propose to take in the exercise of their powers under this Part of this Act by publishing from time to time, in such manner as appears to them appropriate, such information as is in their opinion best designed to further the objects of this Part of this Act.</p></blockquote>
I regard this Amendment as one of considerable importance because we believe it right that people should know
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
when a local authority intend to designate a housing treatment area. The effect of the Amendment is to put a duty on the local authority to publish information about treatment areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments here are similar to those which we had on an earlier Town and Country Planning Bill, concerning the principles in relation to publicity. We believe that publicity is just as important here and that where a housing treatment area has been declared, there should be as much public information about it as possible so that all those who are concerned know what their local authority are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to remember that the designation of a housing treatment area affects not only houses in that area for which demolition or improvement to a tolerable standard is recommended but also good property which happens to be within that particular area. The point which I should like the Minister of State to bear in mind is that we are concerned not only with houses which will be affected by way of demolition or improvement but also with good property within that area. The fact of it falling within a treatment area could have an influence on the value of that good property. It will concern not only those people whose property is directly affected in physical terms but also the owners of other property within the area which is good and, indeed, above the standard, for that property could in a certain respect almost become blighted as a result of what is taking place in the rest of the area. It is only right that people should know about this, and a duty should be laid on the local authority to publish information so that all concerned may know exactly what it is that the local authority are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister of State is always concerned about the drafting of Amendments, particularly where a completely new subsection is proposed, but I hope that in this case there will be no complaints about the drafting. We have drafted the Amendment in the best way we can, and we have had the best advice that is available to us. In fact, we have simply taken Clause 35 out of the English Housing Bill, which contains this provision. Therefore, whatever other defect there may be in this Amendment, I hope that the Minister of State will not fault it on drafting lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the English Bill it was thought fit to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1204">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
include a completely separate Clause which puts this duty on the local authority which I am asking to include in the Scottish Bill. I do not intend to get drawn into any argument that because it is in an English Bill, it is necessarily good for the Scottish Bill. But it is good in principle to have this duty on the local authority to publish information. Therefore I hope that the Minister of State will accept this Amendment, which is important. What we are asking is reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will pay some attention to the contents of this Amendment. I am not suggesting that the wording of the Amendment is necessarily satisfactory, but the aim of the Amendment is good. Normally when a housing development takes place there is an improvement in the area affected. That is generally true. But there are occasions on which a housing development takes place which affects detrimentally other property in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On other occasions I have made plain what is happening in the area of Glasgow in which I live. In that area we are having housing development, and the effect of that housing development is to destroy the amenities of the area or to make them considerably worse. I do not want to develop that aspect on this Amendment, but it is a fact, as is now being shown to every individual in that area. In addition, the property which was already there is in many ways being overwhelmed by the new development which, as it progresses, is beginning to tower like a fortress above property which will be deterimentally affected in its value by the new housing development. I hope that my hon. Friend will not reject the Amendment out of hand. I hope that he will see some good in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have every confidence that my hon. Friend will have some answer to this question, but I do not see that there is any obligation on a local authority to do what is suggested in the Amendment. Therefore I hope that he will consider making a statutory obligation. It is all very well to say that local authorities are enlightened and are concerned about public relations and that good councillors will do all these things, but from experience we know that some-
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
times they are not always blessed with such wisdom in this field of advising the public. Even when there is a statutory obligation, it tends to be conveyed to people "that under the terms of the Housing (Scotland) 1969 Act Section 4(1), this area has now been declared a housing treatment area", which is meaningless to people. There is some need to examine the relationship between local authorities and the public. While I am willing to listen to the reasons which my hon. Friend may give for not putting the provision in the Bill, I hope that he will give some sympathetic consideration to making it obligatory on local authorities to give this information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) will look at Clause 5 he will see that both these Clauses stand together and that it is very important that they be read together. While I acknowledge what my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) said, and while I know the area to which he refers, I think that if he looks closely at what is being proposed he will see that this introduction of a paraphrase of Clause 35 from the English Bill is not appropriate here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the substantial differences between the English Bill and this Bill is that the English Bill, in designating the areas, is concerned with improvement only as distinct from clearance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish housing treatment area, as we discussed it last Sitting, applies only to areas in which the majority of houses fail to fulfil the tolerable standard. The English Bill meets a different situation. We have designed a simple procedure to apply either to clearance or to improvement, whichever is appropriate. I think that this will be recognised by the Committee as one major reason why our procedures have to be different, and I shall try to explain the procedure as we go along.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The resolution which we are discussing under Clause 4(1) has, of course no immediate effect upon individuals. If it provides for demolition, the next step is for the local authority to make a compulsory purchase order. That order is publicised and is served on everyone concerned in the usual way. There is, therefore, no need for additional publicity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where improvement is intended, Clause
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1205">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
5(2) makes special provisions to protect owners. The sanction of compulsory purchase for improvement applies only where it is unlikely that the house concerned will be improved unless it is acquired by the local authority. If the owner himself is prepared to do it, that is a different matter, and we can discuss that in a moment. However, if the sanction of compulsory purchase is required in order to effect such improvement, it can, of course, be done only by the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before a compulsory purchase order for improvement is confirmed by the Secretary of State, he will have to be satisfied that the local authority have given the owners a proper opportunity to do the work themselves. This, in turn, will require publicity for the local authority's policy and for the facilities available in the form of improvement grants and loans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the Committee that we intend to give guidance as to what the Secretary of State will require in these circumstances. This will be set out in the handbook of guidance which will be issued to local authorities when the Bill becomes law. In the case of houses not in tenements, these safeguards are reinforced in Clause 5(2)(
	<i>b</i>), which require that owners should be given at least 12 months' notice of action by local authorities, so that they will have ample opportunity to make improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were in a partisan or dialectical mood, as the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) so often is—and he has no doubt received my recent letter; as he makes no attempt to explain my speeches, I have to explain them for him to his own constituents—I would point out that there is no merit here in "slavishly" following the English in everything that they do, to use the hon. Gentleman's words. I take his point that we should look sensibly at whatever is advocated in the English Bill to see whether it is useful to the Scots or vice-versa.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I assure my right hon. Friend that I am not "slavishly" or in any other way following the English?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or anybody else. My hon. Friend has never had a reputation of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
I am not taking sides about drafting. If there are good things in the English Bill which we might adopt, then by all means let us look at them. Alternatively, if there are things in the English Bill which are inappropriate to us, obviously we should not include them in our Bill. And the importation of this paraphrase of the English Bill is not relevant to us. We are dealing here—and I revert to my major point—with housing treatment areas, which are different from the English concept. Our areas are for clearance or improvement. That being the case, we have to consider both Clauses running together. I would ask the hon. Gentleman not to press this Amendment, as there are already sufficient powers in the Bill to ensure adequate publicity and adequate ways to handle this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that my hon. Friend has taken the point. It may well be that property owners have made representations to hon. Members opposite—and I do not suggest that there is anything sinister in that. It seems to me, however, that a valid point arises here. If one takes the normal situation that exists in Glasgow, it may be that a whole area has been declared a housing treatment area. It may also be the case that one side of it is not affected by the Bill—in other words, the houses are above the tolerable standard. In the interests of good democratic government, it does not seem to me unreasonable that we should have a statutory obligation to advise those people in that area whose houses are not to be compulsorily acquired and which do not require to be brought up to a certain standard. It would benefit us all if people were officially advised of what is going on in the remaining three-quarters of their area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is why I spent so much time talking about the handbook and the need for giving guidance to local authorities. Let us remember what we are discussing. A person's property in a housing treatment area may be subject to the possibility of demolition, and that obviously involves compulsory purchase, or it may involve purchase by agreement, in which case due notice must be given. Alternatively, improvement of that property may be necessary, either by the person concerned or by the local authority. If improvement by the person concerned
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1206">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
is involved, then Clause 5(2)(
	<i>b</i>) covers this situation. I am sorry that we have to discuss these two Clauses in this way, but it is inevitable. If it is a question of the local authority making the improvement, here again we have made provision for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a case should arise in which none of these provisions applies, then there is no reason why we should not ask local authorities to make that clear. But local authorities, particularly in Glasgow, will have a very difficult task in these housing treatment areas. Once having taken a count and having declared by resolution a housing treatment area, they must then go through the area house by house with proposals for improvement or demolition as the case may be, and they must decide who is to do the work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend knows from his own experience that there are cases in which it is adjudged that a house could be brought up to tolerable standards but in which, after preliminary essential works have been started, it is discovered that the house cannot stand up to the structural rearrangement involved. In that case, the decision must be changed and the house demolished. It is therefore not possible to state at the beginning precisely what will be done. The procedure must be taken step by step. For this reason, I say that to put in this provision would be inappropriate to the Scottish Bill. The English are not concerned with demolition, but we are concerned with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish the English had not been brought into this. They are only confusing the position. At least, they are confusing me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I read the Bill, I took it that Clause 5, to which my hon. Friend turned his attention, had no application to the issue which I was raising on Clause 4 and which, so far as I understood the Bill, could be raised only on Clause 4. The issue concerned is that where there is an area which can be designated a treatment area and part of that area contains houses—all owner-occupied in this case—of more than the tolerable standard whereas the other part of the area is unoccupied. In comes the local authority and decides to develop it according to its plans, in such a way as to do harm to the existing independent owner-occupiers. That is a situation which I
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
thought could be dealt with only under Clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know of an area where this happened. I know that it cannot happen again there because there is no more ground to be dealt with in that fashion. This area has been completed. But can the situation be re-created? That is the point as I see it. Can we take steps to give some protection to those individuals who have tried to house themselves in good areas, who have bought or built good houses, and who suddenly find that the values which they have created for the future are undermined under their very noses. What would appear to be a series of fortresses—and my right hon. Friend can come and see for himself—are growing above their heads. They are helpless. All that we now need are a number of guns to be put into these houses, pointing down at us, reminding us, perhaps, that if we say too much then further treatment may be meted out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a situation which has been created and a situation which might be created in the future, because nobody can see the city of Glasgow remaining within its present territorial boundaries. There is bound to be an overflow of the city by the mere pressure being created within it—and I know that my hon. Friend is up to his neck in this aspect of the problem. I believe that he is seeking to obviate it by going outside the city altogether for particular purposes, but that does not come into this discussion at the moment. I hope that my hon. Friend grasps the point which I am putting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before calling the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith), I point out to the Committee there is a danger that hon. Members are trespassing on the discussion on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill. I shall be in some difficulty if the discussion continues in this way. I suggest, therefore, that the discussion be kept within the confines of the Amendment. That will help the Committee. Mr. Buchanan-Smith.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly intend to keep to the precise confines of the Amendment. I am grateful to the hon. Members for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) and for Glasgow, Provan (Mr.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1207">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
Hugh D. Brown) for having supported me in the principle of this Amendment. I confess that I am not entirely satisfied with the explanation given by the Minister of State. I accept what the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan says—that we do not want to follow slavishly what has taken place in English Bills. The only reason I mentioned it was to forestall the Minister, who is sometimes inclined, particularly when the ground is soft and difficult, to attack an Amendment on drafting grounds. I merely use the argument to show that, at least from the drafting point of view, the Amendment was acceptable so that, if he found difficulty in criticising it in other ways, he would not fall back on criticising its drafting. That was the only reason why I introduced that point, and I apologise to the hon. Member for Govan if I have offended him by bringing in that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State talked about writing letters to me. I must confess that I have had no letters yet from the Minister of State regarding what happened previously in Committee. I only wish that, when he quotes figures about local authorities, he would quote the figures which have been given to him by those local authorities and not those which in fact he does quote. But that is a different matter, although the Minister of State introduced it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman would do better to forget about confirming figures. The hon. Gentleman does not even do his own homework.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that, in this case, the hon. Gentleman had not introduced this subject by saying that I should have received a letter which I have not received. That was an improper statement to make. However, I will not follow this further. All I can say is that the figures given by my own local authority do not agree with those which the Minister of State used at our last meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is wrong again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let the hon. Gentleman see the letter from the officials of my local authority stating the information which they provided to the Minister of State. I go by what my local authority says, and I trust my local authority to provide the accurate information. I can-
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
not find these things out for myself, and I rely upon the local authority to provide me with the accurate information in a case such as this. I will not go further on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Returning to the Amendment, I feel that it is very important—more important than the Minister said—to provide for the information which is needed when a housing treatment is declared. Here I think it right to look at this problem in relation to Clause 5. I accept that there is publicity procedure in the event of a house being demolished or of a purchase order; in that case, notice must be served. I appreciate that in that case, exactly as the Minister said, an individual under those circumstances will know precisely what the local authority intends to do. In that case, the position is absolutely clear, and I agree with the Minister in that. If every house in the housing treatment area were to be demolished, or if every house in the housing treatment area were to be improved, then I accept that under Clause 5 those who were affected would be told about it. The point which I raised and which the Minister has not answered—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: —concerns what happens to somebody whose house is neither due to be demolished nor due to be improved within this housing treatment area. If every house within a housing treatment area is to be demolished or every house is to be improved, then I accept that this extra subsection is unnecessary. But in my understanding of a housing treatment area, there will be houses within that area which will be subject neither to a demolition order nor to a requirement by the local authority that they be improved. It is about that type of house that I am thinking. It is that type of person who should be given information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State says that this will be difficult. He says that he will produce a handbook for the guidance of local authorities which will help to cover this point. My argument is that I do not consider a handbook of guidance adeuquate. I would rather see a statutory obligation on the local authority to inform people rather than have it left to a handbook of guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's second point was that,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
when declaring a housing treatment area, it will be difficult in the early stages for the local authority to know exactly and precisely what it will do with every part of that housing treatment area. It will involve—to use his own words—an investigation house by house as to what is to happen. I appreciate that, but if this is to happen, surely it is simpler for the local authority to know eventually what will happen within that housing treatment area. The authority will have to know what is suitable for improvement, what will have to be demolished and what may be left which may be regarded as being up to standard.

Therefore, in purely practical terms I must confess that I am not satisfied by the Minister's argument that this extra subsection in relation to the provision of information in treatment areas is, in purely practical terms, either too difficult to carry out or too awkward for the local authorities. Unless the Minister has more to say about it, I do not feel inclined to withdraw this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are none so deaf as those who will not listen. I said specifically to my hon. Friend the Member for Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown)—and I think he acknowledged it—that in the case of houses within this area—and remember that these would be smaller than the normal comprehensive development areas under planning Acts—the whole purpose is to give a streamlined, very Scottish solution to a very difficult situation which is peculiarly Scottish. We are trying within this smaller area to do two things which the English do not do in this way: one is to clear and the other is to improve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that there may be houses within that area which need neither of those treatments, but the fact is that these houses, too, at a later stage, would have to be dealt with. The housing treatment areas—and we discussed this at our last meeting; I am sorry that the hon. Member for North Angus & Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) does not recall our detailed discussions—will be very tightly drawn and there will be very few houses which will require no action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have talked in terms of streets, of a couple of streets and of a group of
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
properties. We are not talking of vast areas, because that would be more a matter for a comprehensive development area. We are dealing here with an area in which there are good buildings which fall below the tolerable standard. The Cullingworth Report shows that the majority of houses at which we are aiming are houses which will be demolished. This is the essence of the Cullingworth Report—that we shall demolish considerably more than do the English because, even by the minimal tolerable standard which we are adopting here, there are many houses which can never be brought up to that standard. That is the essential difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must let the authorities use this combined procedure in Scotland. In England there are two separate systems, one for clearance and one for improvement. In Scotland, where it is possible for some houses to be rescued and put above the tolerable standard in an area where the majority of houses fall below the tolerable standard, we ought to have our system with the two possibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) was arguing the case of an area which already has housing development of a high standard, and where new houses are built, either for new owner-occupiers, or, as in his case, where local authority houses are built at a particularly high density. That is essentially a planning argument; but it is one with which I sympathise. He knows that during the years in which this dispute has gone on I have shared his view that the density there was too high, and I am still of that opinion. Hon. Gentlemen opposite shared that opinion when they were in office. However, that is a rather different issue. It concerns existing good houses and new houses that are being added to the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are dealing with here is an area to be declared a housing treatment area, an area which, by definition, has bad housing, with a majority of houses below the tolerable standard. This mechanism which we are discussing relates to the assessment of this area in deciding whether to demolish or to improve houses with the owners' consent, or, failing that, whether the local authority should take action. This is the essential purpose. I do not see anything wrong with giving a local authority time to make its structural assessment in order
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>117</span>
to decide how it should deal with this. Then, of course, very few owners of houses in that area would be told, "You are all right; you are not going to be affected either by demolition or by improvement because your houses are above the standard and there is no consequential effect from the improvement of other houses upon you."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry the hon. Gentleman finds this difficult to understand, but we could not import this into this essentially Scottish solution. What one has to do is to look at Clauses 4 and 5 together—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my right hon. Friend agree that in the interpretation which he is giving, the significant word is "tolerable".

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It would not be in order for the hon. Member to seek to define the word "tolerable". It does not come within the confines of the Amendment under discussion.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I followed the Minister's explanation and I understand what he said. He has admitted the very point that I have raised. I accept that only a few people within these treatment areas may be in property that may not be demolished or may not require improvement. Is there any way to protect these few people so that they know what is happening regarding the declaration of a housing treatment area, so that they may have publicity about it? It is for these few people that I think this subsection is important. I accept the procedures in relation to demolition and in relation to requirements for improvements, but I am still not happy about the provision of information about the treatment area to those whose properties are not directly affected physically by it. For that reason, I am not prepared to withdraw this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
to put some points to the Minister, first of all about the size of the area. He made some reference to this during the course of our debate on the last Amendment. We would be grateful if he could give us some idea of the maximum size of the area in question. Presumably it is a great deal smaller than a comprehensive development area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This brings me to my second point, which is very much bound up with the question of its shape. I should like to draw attention to subsection (3) of the Clause. My interpretation of subsection (3) is that if there is a complete building, which has in it no house—which includes the word "flat"—which is below the tolerable standard, then that complete building is excluded from the area. Therefore, one could have an area with a whole lot of islands of complete buildings in which every house is above the tolerable standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be a pretty complicated shape. To take a simple shape, it could have a hole in the middle with two or three buildings which are not affected. I think this brings out the point that has already been made, that some of the occupants of such buildings who find themselves in little islands in the middle of an area may be very concerned about what is happening all round them, but may not be notified because there is no provision whereby they should be notified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to comment on that point, too, and to confirm that in a proposed area where there is a building in which all the houses are above the tolerable standard, it will form an island in the middle of the area and will not be part of the area. The area, therefore, if there are several of these, can be a pretty odd shape.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to come to the point of procedure. Clause 2 sets out some criteria. I think we all know that however precise criteria seem to be described in an Act, nonetheless disagreement will, no doubt, occur in the interpretation and application of these criteria. There may well be aggrieved persons who believe that certain houses do not fall below the tolerable standards as defined in Clause 2. In the application of one of these subparagraphs there is disagreement about the facts and their interpretation. I should like to ask the Minister what is the procedure, if any, for appeal for persons who disagree with the application of these
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1210">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
criteria to the buildings or houses in which they live or in which they have an interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to my final point. I am not sure whether this is an appropriate point, and, if it is not, the Minister may well give us an answer at a later stage in the Bill. I wonder if the Minister could give us some estimate, once this Bill is enacted on broadly its present terms and once the procedures have started, of what would be the total cost in Scotland in a full year, on his own forecast of the amount of activity he would expect in five or six years. Can he give us, in a round, approximate sum, the cost of the work in these housing treatment areas per year? If this is not the right point in the Bill for him to give an estimate, perhaps he will bear it in mind and let us know later. We shall also be interested to know how much of this is likely to fall on the Exchequer and how much on the local authority itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to become philosophical on this issue and so expand matters unduly, but the introduction of "tolerable" in an attempt to attain a definition of certain conditions will increase our housing difficulties as the years go by. There is a wide area of agreement on the word "tolerable". I am sure that hon. and right hon. Gentlemen, if they were to go through the streets of Govan with me, would say that the conditions in which people are living in those streets are quite intolerable. There is no argument about the definition of that word, which applies to a great number of other places in the City of Glasgow and in Scotland as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But when we try to better these things by saying that conditions must cease to be intolerable, with which we agree, and that they shall be tolerable, then tolerable, if it has to be defined, or even if we try to define it in exact terms, becomes a variable word. It is possible that we can today make decisions which could apply, some years hence, in a different way from that which we are anticipating today. Betterment will be taking place as a result of this Bill, but I should imagine that it will be a good many years before another Bill dealing with housing comes in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is tolerable today—and there are areas of the city where things are tolerable or where they will be made tolerable
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
for general acceptance—may become liable to be regarded as intolerable because of the developments and significant improvements that take place in the approach to housing. Where the individual in those areas, if they are owner-occupier areas, is living in what has been a tolerable situation, but finds himself up against a great local authority in a struggle to prove that his conditions which are still tolerable, and the local authority wants to expand for good and definite reasons, he will have a hard battle to fight as an individual seeking to maintain the 
	<i>status quo</i> because we, today, have not been able to define this word "tolerable".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the situation is amorphous and difficult to define, but I hope that my right hon. Friend will keep in mind that lack of exact definition can store up trouble for the future, especially if it should develop—as it has done already in certain parts of Glasgow—into a little struggle between the individual and the local authority. In that kind of struggle, the individual has very little chance of succeeding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom McMillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if my hon. Friend would try to clear up one doubt in my mind. I have tried to look beyond this treatment area. There is in my own constituency an area of possibly 600–700 houses of intolerable standards, which could not be made tolerable. In fact, at present, anything up to 64 have been declared unfit for human habitation. This is a square bounded by four streets, and on the fringe there are possibly 100 houses of tolerable standards. If this Clause goes through and it is declared a housing treatment area, 600–700 houses will be demolished, with anything up to 100 tolerable houses being left. If that were the situation, obviously it would retard any building or development that would go into this particular area. Could the hon. Gentleman clear my mind on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I speak for myself here, and I am not very bright this morning. Some hon. Members would say that I am never very bright. However, I hope I do not sound as irritable as my hon. Friend the Minister of State did. If I may say so, I thought he was a wee bit crusty when he replied to the previous Amendment.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
I should like to compliment him and put him in a better mood by saying that we naturally welcome the Amendment that has been accepted this morning. I only want to make sure that I understand what we have accepted. I presume it is the point that Glasgow was making, that houses which are the subject of demolition orders but have not yet been demolished are included in the count. I think I have it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause is, obviously, a good Clause. But I am still in the dark about what appear to be conflicting ideas on the definition of a housing treatment area. At the last Sitting we were advised that if there was any difficulty, a local authority could juggle about with the boundaries as it desired. It could draw all sorts of absurd areas and even make a housing treatment area of just two or three closes. It is a little unrealistic for the Minister to use the other argument that just because a house has a closing order or an acquisition order put on it, or some obligation to raise it to a tolerable standard, a housing treatment area can be drawn without having in it any houses that do not require any attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about the houses that require no attention. If a local authority official goes to a house and asks about anything, there is an automatic assumption—which may be quite wrong—that something is happening in the area. When we consider young couples who have bought a house, and let us say that they are the ones who have been "taken to the cleaners"—they are not getting a return on their money because the value of the property is not going up as it is in better-off areas—it does not seem unreasonable that in certain circumstances there should be an obligation on the part of the local authority to advise people what is happening in a particular area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is to be in the handbook of guidance? The Minister has not told us. Is it to include at least a mild suggestion that those not affected should be advised of what is going on in the area which has been designated a housing treatment area? It is not unreasonable. It is not unreasonable of the Committee to complain that at a time when the public are not wildly enthusiastic about the democratic concept of local government, we have not had from the Minister some more information and ideas as to what will be in this handbook of guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
I know what will happen. Inevitably, some active councillor—usually one who is regarded as an awkward councillor and a bit of a nuisance, although sometimes this is the only way to get things done—will have no backing in arguing that his local authority should do something. It will merely be said, "Well, it is suggested in the handbook." I do not think this is enough, without some declaration from the Minister that he has taken the point that we have made and will encourage, by the use of strong language if not by the law, local authorities to do what they ought. I am trying to obtain justice for the less fortunate section of the community who have to buy property in areas of dilapidation. In their interests, we are bound to give them the maximum amount of information possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A point was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Tom McMillan) about what would happen in an example that he gave. The answer is that the local authority would probably take the whole treatment area as being defined as 700 houses. I should, however, regard that as very exceptional because housing treatment areas can be of any size. I should like to confirm that to the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell). That is the merit of this section of the Bill, that it does not lay down things strictly and firmly; it allows flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Bill is the result of a great deal of hard work by dedicated men and women who have served a long time in housing in Scotland and who are trying to find the smoothest way of trying to get this translated into action. It is all very well for Parliament to pass Bills, but if they do not work—and the last Bill, for example, did not improve a single house—then we are not only wasting our time here, but we are wasting the time of officials as well. So the Committee should take the point that it is very important that, although we do not write everything into the Bill, it does not mean that we are oblivious to these points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that many good handbooks are written by the Department, of a technical kind as well as of a public advisory kind. They are read by many people; it is our job to try to ensure that. But these housing treatment areas could be as small as a tenement. They could be a few streets, as I mentioned on the last Amendment.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1212">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
Therefore, one can decide what is the best thing to do in the circumstances of the time—and that is the whole merit of the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me two questions about subsection (3): first, what would happen if there were good houses not affected by demolition or by improvement, which were scattered over a housing treatment area? I think that his interpretation of the subsection is quite accurate. What would happen there is that we would have demolition orders on individual houses, if that was thought to be the wisest thing. Alternatively, if there were islands of good houses—not just scattered houses—then they could be acquired under Clause 6 as necessary for proper development or use. In this case the owners would receive notices in the usual way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What Members must recognise is this: there are two forms of notices. There is a general indication to an individual that certain things might happen, that his area is being considered. I agree that that gives rise to uncertainty, but, after all, no official can knock at the door and pronounce exactly on what will happen to that family as a consequence of the inspection of the house and later structural change in the house. No official can do that without being irresponsible. He can only say, "This is now in a housing treatment area. It may be that we will demolish your house; it may be that we will improve it, but, once we have decided this, the proper procedures will be carried out. It may also be the case that we will leave you completely alone." Of course, they might not be pleased with that; they might want to be re-housed. But the fact is that he cannot decide this until the assessment is done, until the decisions are made; then the proper legal procedures of acquisition and development flow from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Owners have rights here. The example was given by the hon. Gentleman of the owner who is aggrieved because he disputes that his house is below the tolerable standard in one respect or another. There, of course, he has his rights when it comes to the question of a compulsory purchase order. Prior to that, he may go to the authority and say, "I do not agree with the sanitary inspector. My house is not below the tolerable standard. Come round to my house and see it." In other words,
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
he can make his point informally. But if the local authority insists on demolishing or improving by using compulsory orders, then there is the right of appeal to the Secretary of State, and the public inquiry at which the aggrieved person would be able to argue his case against a tolerable standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin), who was talking about tolerable standards, will recollect that we have laid down in Clause 2, as itemised as possible, all the tolerable standards. As he points out rightly, these will change. We hope that they will change as society becomes more prosperous. Under Clause 2(2) the Secretary of State would be able, by order, to vary the criteria, not just generally in Scotland, but also individually in different parts of Scotland. So I hope that he is content that we have done our job well on Clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of costs, there is not very much that I can say beyond what is in the Financial Memorandum. To a large extent it depends on how local authorities treat this Bill. As I was trying to point out to the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) and others—and I was doing it in a quite impartial way, despite what their reaction has been—if an authority wants to work hard at removing slums from its area, it will mean an increased demand on the Exchequer; it will also mean an increased demand on the ratepayers. I for one—and I hope that everybody will agree with this—think that the day will never be too early when Scotland will be completely clear of slums. I should like us to be able to say in Scotland in our lifetime. "There are no slums; every family is in a decent house." And we could do that. It is not just in the Glasgows of Scotland that this problem exists; it is all over Scotland. If local authorities were to go at this with a great will, then our estimates would have to be revised. At the moment, with the increase in the housing effort, we still accept that the main housing investment in Scotland will be in new houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman looks at the first paragraphs of the Financial Memorandum, he will see that the special increases which we can assess at the present moment directly attributable to this Bill are about £3 million. They are in higher compensation, the absence of which we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1213">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
admit has been a reason for his Government, and to some extent our Government, not getting ahead with this, owners resisting on grounds which were not proper grounds, but really related to low compensation. So we are accepting this point and grasping this nettle. The increased improvement grants will run at the rate of about £2.4 million and the environmental grant will run at the rate of about £200,000. This is as far as we can estimate at the moment. As I say, these figures may change; it depends on the way things develop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Provan feels that I have dealt with the question of publicity. It is important to see it in two ways. There are the legal requirements on the State in relation to owners and occupiers. These must be carried out properly, and are laid down in the Bill and in previous provisions. The earlier stages of consultation and giving them the maximum information, I think, is a very good thing to do, but it has to be handled in an intelligent and appreciative way, inasmuch as no official can knock on a door and give the full facts, because he does not know them; he cannot know them until the proper inspection has been carried out and proper representations made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) has raised the point that the owner-occupier concerned may dispute that the house is below the tolerable standard, and he could be right. It is sometimes the case that in public inquiries people in this country do win against local authorities and central departments where they prove the facts. So we must leave this point open to them, that they can make their case, and that just because a housing treatment area is declared that is not the end of the matter. There must be not only consultation, which I endorse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot give the whole terms of the handbook. It would be absurd for a Minister in a debate on this Motion to attempt to give a summary of what would be in a handbook any more than I can give a summary of what the Skeffington Committee will propose in relation to publicly in planning. I cannot do that because it would take too long. I give the assurance—I am seized of the point, as they
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
say—that there must be consultation and that the people concerned must be told, as far as is possible, how these areas will be dealt with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>PROVISIONS SUPPLEMENTARY TO S. 4</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 21, in page 4, line 10, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>(
	<i>a</i>) within 28 days of the passing of the resolution the local authority shall serve a notice in respect of every house in the housing treatment area upon the person having control of the house and upon any other person who is an owner of the house stating that the resolution has been made and indicating the requirements to be met to bring the house up to at least the tolerable standard.</p></blockquote>
I am simply asking for clarification of the working of Clause 5(2). The Minister dealt with this to some extent in debates on our later Amendments to Clause 4. Perhaps he would elaborate a little further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not yet clear how this subsection is to work. As I see it, subsection (2) refers to the local authority's powers under Clause 4(2)(
	<i>b</i>) requiring houses in treatment areas to be brought up to a tolerable standard. Clause 5(2) gives the local authority power to purchase property to carry out the objectives outlined in Clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where the property is not a tenement, we have the notice procedure under subsection (2)(
	<i>b</i>)(
	<i>i</i>). The notice procedure seems to be clear where the property is not a tenement. But I am not clear about what happens when the property is a tenement dealt with under this subsection. The effect of this Amendment—which I have moved more for clarification than for any other purpose—is to extend the notice procedure to all houses which a local authority may propose to purchase in a housing treatment area, removing the restriction which appears to be placed on the type of house to which notice procedure refers. That is my reasoning behind the Amendment, and I should appreciate it if the Minister would clarify some of the points which I have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment removes a distinction between tenements and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
houses. The implication, therefore, is that one can treat tenements in precisely the same way as houses. If the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) would reflect for a moment—and I have already discussed this in the Committee—he would realise that in tenements the chances are that the single ends, which are usually in the middle of the landing, will be extinguished completely as separate homes. They will probably be divided and used to provide bathrooms for the houses on either side. There may be some other variant, because there are a number of constructions of tenements, but the result is that, taking the net total of houses, there is a loss in the number of housing tenements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To serve on an occupier of such a single end a notice telling him that he is to bring his house up to the tolerable standard is, in fact, meaningless as he cannot do so. It is true that in the case of some houses, perhaps even a majority of houses, in a tenement block it may be possible to do so. The reason for retaining a distinction is in order that we should not waste time on this prior procedure. Because we do not want to cause confusion in people's minds with official notices about this, we feel that it would be a mistake to do this, not just a waste of time. It would throw people into genuine confusion as to why they were served a notice in respect of a house which it would be impossible to bring up to the tolerable standard. It is for that reason that we are maintaining the distinction between houses and tenements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation, and I accept and appreciate the practical reason for his argument. I should like to take this one stage further. In the case of a person living in a single end of a tenemant, such as he instanced, what procedure would there be to ensure that that person knew exactly what was happening?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very difficult to go to a person's door and say, "We have just prepared a housing treatment area and we shall now tell you exactly what is to happen to you." It may be that the 12 houses in the tenement block will be made into eight, and there may be a scramble among 'the families—this is a
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
common experience, by the way, in rehousing in different areas—who want to stay there. One cannot say, "We are going to move you. We are going to rehouse you in a local authority house, permanently away from this district."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we should do, in fact, would be simply to say to the person, "This whole tenement, or this whole street, is the subject of a housing treatment area order. We are going to reassess the houses and decide the best way of bringing them up to the tolerable standard. If they are to be demolished, you will be rehoused, and we shall try to suit your convenience and that of your family as best we can, but we must consider you along with everybody else so involved."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must take the position of the owners of the property into account. It may be a mixed ownership, or it may be that the property is totally owned by one landlord, in which case the circumstances are entirely different. I take the point about occupation which is causing concern here. The hon. Member referred to Clause 16. Under it, we can serve a notice on every occupier in relation to control of the letting of that property during the time in which the matter is being dealt with. That is a rather different issue, and I accept that, in that case, we have to serve notices on all those concerned. But that is not about the future of the house; that is about the future of the occupation of the property and its dependence on the way in which it is developed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister.

I hope that he equally appreciates—and obviously this is a point which could be left to the handbook of guidance—that alarm and despondency could be created in somebody in the single end who, knowing that the people in the two flats on either side had had a notice served on them, wondered what his future was to be. This is a human point which probably cannot be met in the Bill, but it is one which I hope the Minister bears in mind.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 22, in page 5, line 4, leave out subsection (5).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that this Amendment will take very long. I know that in earlier debates on housing legislation in this Committee there has been a lot of discussion, in one way or another, of exactly how to define a tenement. I must confess that, when reading through subsection (5), I get half-way through it and am left rather dizzy—and I am sure that other hon. Members feel the same way—as to what exactly is comprised in a tenement, where premises are divided horizontally, whether or not they are on the same floor and so on. It becomes rather difficult in one's mind to envisage precisely what is intended. All of us have our own pictures of what is meant by a tenement, but, when seeing it written down in black and white like this, it does not necessarily marry up with what one has in one's mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that there is a problem of definition. I appreciate, equally, that that definition of a tenement has been used in previous legislation. My simple purpose in moving the Amendment is to enquire of the Minister whether, in the working of previous legislation, this definition has proved adequate. Has it raised difficulties in interpretation? Is there some way in which this definition can be improved? It is a probing Amendment, and I am interested in hearing the Minister's comments on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In Section 87 of the 1966 Act—Part IV of which we are repealing in the Bill—we provide particular definitions, and we are repeating these in subsection (5). It is important that we should have this subsection, since it carries forward the definition contained in the repealed Part IV of the 1966 parent Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made one slight modification of the definition in Section 87 of the 1966 Act. Originally this definition mentioned a building which not only contained two or more flats but had been so constructed in the first place. The refinement which had the effect of excluding from the definition a case in which a tenement was produced by conversion seemed in our opinion unnecessary, and we have taken this opportunity to drop it. In that way we

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) is not here to move his Amendment No. 97 to this Clause, in page 5, line 19, at end add:
	<br><blockquote><p>"including the provision of good environmental standards".</p></blockquote>
This is an interesting Amendment and it would certainly have helped to give clarification to this Clause. I hope that I may raise one or two points which perhaps the hon. Member would have covered had he been here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that this Clause is a good one. As the Cullingworth Report so clearly brought out, it is not enough—as we have said before on this Committee, and in other debates on town and country planning—to improve houses or to build new houses unless suitable attention is paid to creating a proper environment around those houses. This is important for social reasons. We had much discussion on that on the Town and Country Planning Bill, and I do not intend to go into it this morning. Speaking for myself, and for the Opposition, I hope that local authorities will use their powers under this Clause to make sure not only that property is improved, or an area demolished and houses built, but that opportunity is taken to acquire ground round about in order to provide, for example, play spaces or adventure playgrounds. I imagine that that is what this Clause envisages. It will be very disappointing if local authorities do not make sure, in their housing treatment areas, that the whole environment is improved as well
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1216">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
as the houses themselves. This has the most important social implications, and it is a step which I wish to see encouraged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like, in relation to environment, to raise one other point. I refer to Chapter 4 of the Cullingworth Report, on pages 36 and 37, where it states that the question of environment is not just a matter of physically providing playgrounds or playspaces and so on, but that environment itself can be much improved by quite simple things, such as better organisation of the collection of refuse or tidyness. These are all matters which do not involve the acquisition of land. I hope, therefore, that when local authorities consider the question of environment they will also bear in mind these other simpler, more direct ways, in which environment can be improved. Paragraph 133 of the Cullingworth Report states that, in relation to the environment factor, there ought to be far closer liaison between the different departments of a local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I consider this an important point, and I should like to give an example of it. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) is not here, but he is aware that I visited part of his constituency last week to see some of the tenements in the Kingston Ward. Certain areas there are coming under orders for demolition because of the new Renfrew Motorway. There are also houses adjacent to that motorway which would be of the type to come under a housing treatment area as envisaged in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concern was shown among occupiers of those houses—and the view was expresed to me by a councillor to whom I spoke—about the liaison between the different departments of the local authority. The houses to be demolished because of the motorway were the concern of the department of planning and of roads. Those houses adjacent to but not directly affected by the motorway came under the jurisdiction of the housing department. There was concern that there was insufficient liaison between the planning section and the housing section of the local authority on the question where the responsibilities of one finished
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
and the responsibilities of the other began.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This example serves to show that the question of improving environment involves not only housing departments. It also calls for a high degree of liaison between different departments of a local authority, as Cullingworth said. I hope that there will not be too much of one department saying, "My responsibility finishes there in improving the area. Another department takes over from there". I hope that there will be overlapping and co-operation between them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this Clause will be effective, because, in the lives and social conditions of people in these housing treatment areas, it is important that environment as well as houses should be improved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>POWER OF LOCAL AUTHORITY TO RETAIN HOUSES SUBJECT TO DEMOLITION FOR TEMPORARY OCCUPATION</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 26, in page 6, line 33, leave out from "house" to end line 34 and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in a condition which satisfies the tolerable standard for the purposes of this Act".</p></blockquote>
Under this Clause the local authority is given power to retain in temporary occupation houses which are subject to demolition if it is considered necessary that these houses should be retained in tem-
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
porary occupation. What concerns me is that there is no statement of the standard to which such houses shall be maintained where they are kept in occupation, albeit temporary occupation. I agree that the Clause is necessary. There will be occasions on which it will be necessary to keep houses in temporary occupation, however much we wish they could be closed as soon as they fall below the tolerable standard. Obviously where there are difficulties of re-housing there will be times when that will be necessary. But it is important that we should know to which kind of standard these houses will be kept while in temporary occupation. As I read it, the Clause gives discretion to a local authority to allow this temporary occupation. But what happens to a privately-owned house where there is a problem of rehousing? It seems to me that power is given to the local authority which is not extended to a private occupier or private landlord in similar circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the Amendment is to ensure that where a house has to be kept in temporary occupation, it shall be kept up to a tolerable standard. I appreciate that this may be asking a lot, and to that extent the Amendment seeks clarification. I should like to know what is the position in respect of a house in private occupation, as well as in respect of a house which is controlled by the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Clause deals with the power of local authorities to retain for temporary occupation houses subject to demolition. If the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) would look at paragraph 208 of the Cullingworth Report, he will see that, while Cullingworth argues that there is a case for encouraging and requiring authorities to do much more patching, as it is called, the Committee accepted that patching implied limited work falling short of proper improvement. No local authority wants to own slums—and that is what this means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the benefit of the people living there for a few months, the authority may have to repair the roof or to carry out some temporary but essential improvement in their circumstances until they can be rehoused. We had this problem with storm damage when some of the houses were clearly going to be demolished in the next year or the next six months. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1218">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>135</span>
question then was, what kind of repair should we do when we knew that the house was going to be demolished? One has got to be economical with resources. There is no point in putting a fine ten-year roof on a property which is to come down in six months. That is a misuse of public money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gregor Mackenzie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not know from the Clause what the time factor will be. That worries some of us a little.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. But if we were to accept the Amendment we could not allow occupation to occur at all of a house below the tolerable standard unless we put in a w.c. Work on roofing might involve unjustifiable expenditure, for example, in circumstances in which the intention was to demolish the house quite soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that it is very important that the authorities should not have these houses in occupation for very long. My hon. Friend, who has a great deal of experience in this matter, knows that authorities do not like to be managing slum properties. They want to get rid of them as fast as they can. Sometimes, when one is acquiring property, one cannot decant everybody out of that area at once. Such people ought to have a very high priority, particularly when, even by definition, they are below the tolerable standard and the houses are unfit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will look again at this question of how temporary is "temporary", in view of the comment made by my hon. Friend. I think that he accepts the practical point that there is a transitional time during which, even though the house is not of the tolerable standard, it would be unfair not to make some attempt at repairing a roof, however temporarily, in order to give the family shelter for another week or a month or so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State referred to paragraph 208 and the following paragraphs of the Cullingworth Report.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Rutherglen (Mr. Gregor Mackenzie) puts his finger on the specific purpose behind my Amendment when he asks exactly what is meant by the word "temporary". This is why the Amendment asks that these houses shall be up to tolerable standard. If temporary occupation becomes more permanent, then we want to see these houses up to tolerable standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the Minister's assurance that he will look at this point, but may I go further into the issue which has been raised by the Minister, and which was specifically mentioned in the Cullingworth Report, about the powers of local authorities to carry out patching and improvement of property which is to be in temporary occupation. The Cullingworth Committee was critical of local authorities in Scotland and of how little had been done in the way of patching in order to continue houses in temporary occupation. This point is highly relevant. If local authorities are to be given powers to maintain houses in temporary occupation, I hope that they will use the powers which they have already under the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1950 to use grants from the Exchequer to carry out patching.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 210 of the Report says that the Cullingworth Committee were unable to go into the matter in great detail:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We were, however, able to discover that only twelve authorities had made any use of the grants. In eleven of these the average number of houses for which grant had been approved was twelve. In the case of the twelfth authority, Glasgow, it was 3,000".</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 211 adds:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is a pitiable rate of progress".</p></blockquote>
This is highly relevant. If we are giving local authorities this power to patch, we must make quite certain that they are prepared to use the other finances available to them to make sure that these houses are kept up to the highest standards possible. In paragraph 216, Cullingworth concludes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We therefore recommend that the financial provisions for patching should be reviewed as a matter of urgency and that local authorities with a clearance problem which cannot be met within five years should be required to use their powers for the acquisition and patching of property which falls below the Tolerable Standard".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1219">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>137</span>
I should be interested to hear whether the Minister will take steps to ensure that the provisions of Section 17 of the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1950 are brought home to local authorities so that where houses are to be kept in temporary occupation, money is available to carry out patching and to make sure that where these houses are not up to tolerable standards, at least they are not allowed to fall into too serious a state of disrepair. If we have that assurance, in addition to asurances on the points raised by the hon. Member for Rutherglen, it will help to ease some of the concern which some of us feel in relation to this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The very fact that Clause 8 is in the Bill proves that the Government are anxious that these powers should be used. The very fact that I have referred to the Cullingworth Report recommendation proves that we accept the recommendation. But, like my hon. Friend, the Member for Rutherglen (Mr. Gregor Mackenzie), I do not like patching. I regard patching as a temporary expedient to be avoidable as much as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment says that we should do no patching and that we should bring all the houses up to a tolerable standard. I am not in favour of bringing a house of this character up to a tolerable standard. The inevitable destiny of the house is to be demolished—otherwise it would not come within Clause 8, it would come under the previous Clauses and could be improved to the tolerable standard. The future of this house is certain; it will be knocked down. Why spend money on patching up property which is to be knocked down in any event. Let us not overdo this. We accept that patching must be done, but we do it with reluctance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take my hon. Friend's point about the word "temporary". We can do nothing about it in statute, but we certainly ought to give some guidance in practice. Local authorities, on the whole, do not use this power. They do not like using this power. They do not like to be called slum landlords. They do not like people in occupation of their properties which are slums for a year or two years. I can appreciate that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment states that we should make these houses tolerable. That misunderstands the whole purpose of the Clause. The purpose of the Clause is to
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
cover the transitional period. It is an unpleasant period. I should not like to be the M.P. for that area or the councillor for that area, because I should not like to ask the families living there to wait a little longer while the roof was patched in a temporary way, telling them that they may be re-housed in a week, a fortnight, a month or a year. It would be an unpleasant thing to have to say. I went through all that with the storm damage. I found it an agonising period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I am in favour of this Clause, obviously, and while I accept the Cullingworth recommendations, I accept patching only as a temporary and rather uncomfortable expedient. I hope that the hon. Member, too, responds in that spirit to the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I do. I said when moving the Amendment that I was seeking clarification regarding the standards at which the Minister expects these houses to be maintained. No more than the Minister of State do I want to see these houses perpetuated. We do not want to see the local authorities becoming slum landlords, as the Minister put it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the fact remains that there are cases in which patching is necessary, otherwise there will be nowhere to put these people. There will be no houses for them. It is no use sweeping this under the carpet and saying that because we do not like it, we can ignore it. The very fact that the Clause is in the Bill shows that it is a problem which we must not ignore. I accept that it is necessary, however undesirable it may be—and I do not disagree with the Minister of State that it is thoroughly undesirable to him to patch up and keep in occupation a property which ought to be demolished, and which would be demolished but for the fact that there is nowhere to rehouse the people from that property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities, with the possible exception of Glasgow, did not use the powers available to them to do this patching in these undesirable but unavoidable situations, and I am expressing the hope that it is made clear to local authorities that there is money available for this purpose and that it should be used. That is all I was asking, and nothing more. I hope that the Minister understands that that was my argument and that I am not asking that bad property
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1220">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

I said that it was a probing Amendment to inquire to what standard this type of property should be maintained. This relates to the very relevant point made by the hon. Member for Rutherglen (Mr. Gregor Mackenzie)—the length of time it is to be in temporary occupation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy with the Minister's reply to this Amendment, although I ask him not to read into my remarks, as he tended to do, the suggestion that I want to see this kind of property perpetuated. That is the last thing I want. I am asking him to be realistic, to recognise that this is a situation which will occur and to make sure that help is available to local authorities which find themselves in the difficult and unpleasant position of having to retain in temporary occupation property which, in the best circumstances, ought to be demolished.

This is important because when somebody goes into a sub-standard property, probably with a very low rent, which discourages the landlord from carrying out decorations or other things like that, it is often the occupier of the house who does a lot of small alterations in one way or another—such as providing internally built-in cupboards—and I am sure that many of us are aware of houses which are perfect examples of good maintenance, however dilapidated the general
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1221">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>141</span>
structure of the surrounding area may be. So often that maintenance has been carried out with loving care and attention by the occupier of the house over many years. It is particularly fitting that this extra payment for good maintenance should be specifically tied to the person who is responsible, even though he is a tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice in subsection (1) of the Clause that it is the Secretary of State who has to be satisfied that the property is well maintained. I also note that it is the Secretary of State who has to cause
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the house to be inspected by one of his officers"</p></blockquote>
and therefore the whole onus for authorising special payment in respect of well maintained houses falls back upon the Secretary of State himself and upon his officers. This does not, in fact, become a function of the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I should like to ask the Minister of State, precisely how this procedure will work. For example, what scale of payment will there be, in numbers of applications, for well-maintained property, and what sort of burden will be placed on his Department—not on the local authority—in verifying where a house has been well-maintained and in deciding how much money should be paid? It is interesting to note that the responsibility is given to the Secretary of State for the actual inspection by his officers. I should like to know how the Secretary of State imagines the procedure will work, how much work will arise and how it will be coped with, because it would be helpful to know how effective this subsection is going to be, and how easy it will be for those who have maintained their houses well to make sure they get proper payment without too much delay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. McMillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if my hon. Friend will help the Glasgow Corporation on two points which worry them. First, there is no procedure laid down for initiating their claims and they feel that the onus for doing so should be on the occupier and other interested persons. Secondly, they feel that there should be a time limit for claims to avoid the pile-up of administrative work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been asked a number of questions. The amount of payment is laid down in Clause 22, which we
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
may reach soon. The inspection takes place as part of the proceedings under the compulsory purchase order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under subsection (1) the Secretary of State may give directions to the local authority that a well-maintained payment is to be made in respect of any house which is being purchased, as not meeting the tolerable standard. He does this by having the house inspected by one of his officers. At the moment, inspections are carried out by the building inspectors of the Scottish Development Department and sometimes they are accompanied—in fact, in most cases we prefer this—by an official of the sanitary inspectors department. On average some 30 per cent. of houses in clearance areas are the subject of directions, most of them being on owner-occupied houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) is interesting because it directs to whom the payment is made. It can be made either to the owner-occupier, or the landlord if the maintenance is done by him, or it can be shared between the occupier and the landlord in accordance with the application of any person to the local authority for a share of that particular grant. Obviously, the occupier, unless he is living in accommodation which is entirely looked after by the landlord—and that is rather exceptional—will expect to get, if not all certainly the bulk of, this payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Edinburgh Corporation have represented to us in the past that since they have no detailed information as to the grounds for the Secretary of State's direction, it might be considered unreasonable that they should be called upon to decide to whom it should be made. But in practice, from our inspections—and I remarked about the inspectors being accompanied by a sanitary inspector as well—we would expect that the Department's building inspectors would have a good idea as to the basis of the direction; and the sanitary inspector accompanying him would know of that and would advise the local authority on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the background of the Clause It is a good Clause and I think it is right that we should have this. Many of these homes, even though they are below the tolerable standard, have been the homes of families for many years and are looked after with loving care and devotion even though the facilities are not all that good. I accept that that is not always true, but in many cases it is, and it is right that payments in respect of well-maintained houses should be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is a drafting Amendment which is intended to make it clear that where a local authority under paragraph (

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 13 as it is drafted might be taken to mean that an authority could only impose the condition of bringing the house up to the tolerable standard. An authority might, for example, want to insist when disposing of a house under Clause 13(
	<i>a</i>) that as the house was to be resold within a certain period, it should first of all be offered to the authority or that the works to bring the house up to a tolerable standard should be completed by a certain day after purchase.

We know that rights of way, for the most part, are found in the countryside. In the city developments they do not appear at all as an obstacle. But when development begins to take place further out from the cities, we may find that this will become a more important matter than it presently appears. So I wonder whether my right hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very simple Amendment. It ensures that the occupier of a house subject to a control order, as well as the owner and person having control, receives notice of the making of the order. The order cannot, because of the terms of subsection (3), prevent the continuing occupation of the house by the person in occupation at the time the order is made. But the occupier might be interested in permitting subsequent occupation by someone else, for example, by subletting, and should be made aware of the order. In the absence of such a notice, he would not be in the position of "knowingly" permitting the house to be occupied, and so would not commit an offence by subletting. The Amendment puts him in precisely the same position as it puts the owner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Housing treatment area provisions, however, provide for the houses being demolished even if they meet

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 34, in page 12, leave out line 11, and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and cannot be made to do so at reasonable expense".</p></blockquote>
Under Section 15 of the 1966 Act, the local authority have to be satisfied that a house on which it is proposed to place a demolition order is unfit and incapable, at a reasonable expense, of being rendered so fit. This requirement at which the local authority must look under the 1966 Act has been removed in the Bill. The purpose of the Amendment is, quite simply, to ask why it has been felt necessary to remove that requirement which is laid on the local authority. As I read it under the Bill, the local authority must be satisfied that the house does not meet the tolerable standard and, secondly—a far more subjective standard—that it ought to be demolished. The provision about it being incapable at reasonable expense of being rendered so fit tended to make the whole question regarding a demolition order slightly more specific. Why has it been thought necessary to remove that qualification?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a change in the provisions of the 1966 Act. Part II of that Act is, in fact, being amended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will recall that Part II of the 1966 Act, which contains the power of a local authority to deal with individual houses which are unfit for human habitation, makes a distinction between those unfit houses which are capable of being made fit at reasonable expense and those which cannot be so made fit. If the house is capable of being made fit under the present Statute at reasonable expense, the local authority may serve a notice requiring the necessary works to be carried out. In any other ease, they must serve a demolition or a closing order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers to require works on indi-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>149</span>
vidual, unfit houses are little used. They are replaced by Part II of the Bill, which give authorities power to require works of repair on houses which are in a state of "serious disrepair". The distinction between the procedures which are appropriate to one kind of house below the tolerable standard and not to another is not, therefore, preserved by the Bill and the grounds for insisting on writing references to reasonable expense into this Statute largely disappear with that distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions relating to the tolerable standard, as they are incorporated in Part I of the Bill and as they are being applied to Part II of the 1966 Act, require local authorities to take decisions as to the proper treatment of particular houses—that is to say, they have to ask themselves a simple question: whether the house should be demolished or whether the house should be improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the expense involved will be, in the normal case, one of the most important factors to be taken into account before a decision is reached. If they decide that a house ought to be demolished then, of course, the owner can appeal to the sheriff against the demolition order. One of his grounds of appeal could be that he is able to bring the house up to the tolerable standard and, consequently, that the house should not be demolished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will know that the last line of Clause 17 is worded as it is so as to exclude the possibility of making a closing or a demolition order on a house which the local authority itself thinks ought to be improved.

Amendment No. 35, in page 12, line 22, leave out paragraph (
	<i>a</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an exploratory Amendment. There have been many exploratory Amendments this morning, which must have warmed the heart of the Minister of State, for it shows a reasonable and constructive attitude on the part of the Opposition, in trying to have the Bill better explained to the general public. I hope that he will take note of the spirit in which we are dealing with these Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I for one—as well as others outside the Committee—am slightly confused about the exact meaning of this Clause and its precise purpose. I have studied the Clause fairly. The heading, on page 12, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Payments to certain owner-occupiers in respect of houses not meeting tolerable standard which are purchased or demolished "</p></blockquote>
The first point which arises—and this is why I moved our Amendment to leave out paragraph (
	<i>a</i>)—is that when one reads the Clause one almost loses the direct reference to owner-occupier. There seems to me to be a very narrow difference between someone who is an owner-occupier and someone who is an occupier for a certain period of time. This will particularly relate to Clause 19. I note that a further Amendment proposes that Clause 19 be deleted. If Clause 19 were not to be deleted, I intended to suggest that my Amendment No. 37 should be taken at the same time as this Amendment, since it raises exactly the same point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In proceeding, therefore, from Clause 18 to Clause 19, it seems to me that the difference between someone who is specifically an owner-occupier and someone who qualifies for payment as having been in occupation for a certain period becomes very narrow. It appears to me that a person's interest in a house, which qualifies him in respect of the payment referred to in this Clause, depends not necessarily upon ownership but upon his occupation of the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not a lawyer, and that is why I have asked for clarification on this point. It seems to me that a person qualifies through his interest as an occupier of a property almost more than through his interest as an owner-occupier. If my argument is correct technically the occupier could be a tenant. Therefore the payment mentioned in the heading which I quoted is to an owner-occupier. I find difficulty in distinguishing between an owner-occupier and someone
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1226">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>151</span>
who qualifies simply through being an occupier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I ask the Minister to explain, in relation to this Amendment, the precise purpose of this mandatory payment to certain owner-occupiers. It would help, in deciding why certain classes of people qualify while others do not qualify, to know the exact purpose of this payment. Is it because of the disturbance which the occupier will suffer as a result of a demolition order? Is it because the cleared site value is regarded as being unfair and inadequate in certain circumstances? And, if I may go one stage further, if it is because the cleared site value is regarded as inadequate, why has this payment been restricted to owner-occupiers and not extended to landlords who have a financial interest in the property?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would clarify the whole basis of this Clause if, in addition to answering specific points about who qualifies for payment, and about the distinction between occupier and owner-occupier, the Minister of State told us in more detail exactly what is the purpose of the Clause. I apologise to the Minister if my thoughts seem slightly muddled. Frankly, I have been muddled about the purpose of the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I add a little to the confusion? I am in the same boat, and if I have interpreted correctly the lengthy submission received from the Corporation of Glasgow, I feel that some of the officials there are in the same boat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The magnitude of this problem for Glasgow is revealed by the figures—14,000 to 15,000 houses in the next three years. It is advisable that we should spend a little time in trying to understand the meaning of the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understood the remarks of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, this payment represents the difference between site value and market value. My attention has been drawn to the fact that one may not acquire the site when acquiring a house. I should like this point to be cleared up. How do we tell the public about this? There is a general impression—with which I certainly do not agree—that we should not draw the attention of the public to this matter but should leave it to them to find out how to proceed with their claim. Is there any time limit on the claim? I gather that there is some statutory restriction on claims on
	<span class='label label-info column'>152</span>
nationalised industries—a time limit which can be enforced under certain circum stances. Since we are not talking in terms of gigantic sums, this may be a point worth considering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will this make extra work for district valuers, or has the local authority staff who are skilled to deal with this problem? What effect will it have on the re-housing element? As my hon. Friend knows, many local authorities involved in this kind of procedure often offer a council house and make a nominal payment of £1 to satisfy legal requirements. I am at least right in saying that some new provision is being introduced and that the impression is created in the minds of many that this is an additional payment which owner-occupiers will get in the future to which they are not entitled now. For this reason, it would be as well if it were explained to us in simple, lucid terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Naturally, as I always do, I shall explain it in nice, simple terms, as far as I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present basis for slum clearance as it stands at the moment derives from legislation at the end of the last century. It assumes that an unfit house has no value, so that compensation for it should be based only on the value of the cleared site. This principle remains in the Bill, but this Clause provides for supplementary payments which are not "compensation"—and I use the word in inverted commas. They are supplementary payments to be made to certain owner-occupiers. I will return to this distinction in a moment. The payments will amount to the difference, if any, between the market value and the site value.

The justification for making this change—and I agree that it is a major change for Scotland; not for England—is that substandard houses have for many years been changing hands at substantial prices. A great many of the objections which I mentioned earlier this morning to slum clearance compulsory purchase orders, however they are disguised in the proceedings, are objections against the low level of compensation, and that has been a major factor in slowing down clearance. In my own constituency I have had some experience of this, and I feel very sorry for these young couples who see £500, £600 or £800 wiped out when the local authority—quite rightly and the couple do not disagree with it—say that the house is due for demolition

and ought to go. They offer them a house on the local authority list, but that is a big sum of money for a young couple to lose.

The Committee will remember the provision which we made about those who were left holding hire-purchase agreements in buying houses and how we gave a right under Section 18 of the 1967 Act whereby, by going to the sheriff, they could seek some readjustment and perhaps could extinguish the arrangement. The Cullingworth Committee is our mentor in this, they said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… a comprehensive review should be undertaken of the provisions relating to … the compulsory acquisition of substandard housing."</p></blockquote>
This is part of that change. I admit that it is not the complete change that some people wanted, and, as my hon. Friend for Provan (Mr. Brown) demonstrated, it is not a change which is welcomed by everybody. The Glasgow Corporation, for example, are one of the major bodies who have represented to us that little, if any, improvement should be made in the existing compensation provisions. I am not disguising from the Committee the fact that this step is not necessarily welcomed by everybody. There are difficulties. My hon. Friend the Member for Provan in itemising a number of these difficulties is buttressing this case. I am not saying that he shares it, but at least he is presenting it on behalf of the Corporation and some other authorities.

In the next three years, Glasgow expects to make closing or demolition orders on 14,000 to 15,000 houses. In relation to these houses, there is no acquisition but supplement certainly has to be paid. The Chief Valuer, after very careful consideration, has said to us that, subject to any necessary adjustments of his staff, he can cope with the extra work. Knowing the problems here, I hope that the Chief Valuer is right in that opinion, but that is all that I can give the Committee as reassurance on that score.

I was asked the difference between owner-occupiers and those mentioned in paragraph (
	<i>a</i>). There is, in fact, no difference. Paragraph (
	<i>a</i>) defines what is meant by owner-occupation and adds a condition about the length of that occupation in that it provides that only certain owner-occupiers will qualify for payment. The Clause goes on to define the length of time of occupation and the other interests of persons who are said to have an interest
	<span class='label label-info column'>154</span>
—and that includes owners, lessees and those purchasing the house by instalment. It excludes tenants for a year or less and statutory tenants protected by Rent Acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, it is not an uncomplicated situation. That is why we shall change the cross-reference—which, incidentally, is not in the Bill but is simply an aid to the Bill—in an attempt to clarify this, because we are referring here to certain owner-occupiers and others. I will make this change when we reprint the Bill. The cross-reference, I agree, is not clear.

The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) is using the Amendment as a probing Amendment, but if we were to incorporate it, in fact it would make no distinction. It would simply say that market value should be payable in all cases in which houses fail to meet the tolerable standard—and if Glasgow Corporation are not pleased with this Clause, they would be a thousand times less pleased with the Amendment. The justification is not just the Cullingworth justification of speeding up these offers and giving an incentive for authorities to proceed, because many people object on the grounds that they are losing money, although they disguise their objections in different ways. There is also the question of fairness to those owner-occupiers with relatively modest means who have committed a large part of their savings to acquire a house. It is a house of a relatively poor standard, but nevertheless it is the only way in which they can get a house in the present housing shortage.

If the position is still unclear, when I come to the next Amendment and the other associated with it I will have another attempt at clarifying what is not a simple situation to explain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister of State for explaining this point and I have no intention of pressing this Amendment. I am glad that at least I am correct in assuming that the Clause applies to certain owner-occupiers and others and that it is not confined to owner-occupiers. That was one of the root causes of my confusion, and I am grateful to the Minister for explaining the point.

We welcome this provision particularly as it has the effect of speeding up slum clearance which is obviously something we welcome and want to encourage. The effect of paying this difference between clearance
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1228">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>155</span>
site value and market value is something which we welcome. It applies to owner-occupiers and others, and the Minister of State gave the example of young couples who have bought property of this type.

All of us. have sympathy with people in those circumstances but I should like to know why it has been confined to these people and why landlords have not been included. I have a case in my own constituency—I gave an example of this when we debated the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Bill—of somebody who put his savings into a house, and lived in a different house which eventually became the subject of a demolition order. He received site value and eventually lost all his savings, which resulted in a considerable personal hardship. Therefore, there can equally be hardship on landlords. I should like to have clarification of that point before I seek leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

my hon. Friend has said on that point; There is always the assumption that an owner-occupier may be poor but a landlord never is. As my hon. Friend has pointed out, landlords very often are poor. I do not see why they should not get compensation too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have to accept the fact that we are talking here about compensation for a house, which does not meet the tolerable standard, which is purchased or demolished. In other words, the owner himself, no matter how hard he tries, cannot bring it up to the tolerable standard, or even if, in his opinion, he can do this he is ruled out on appeal to the sheriff. So we are talking about an asset which is no longer an asset—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
