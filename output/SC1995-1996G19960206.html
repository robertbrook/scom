I welcome you, Mr. McWilliam, to the Chair. I also extend my welcome to Mrs. Winterton, who will assist you by chairing the Committee in your absence. An interesting parallel can be seen with the Standing Committee that considered the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993. On that occasion, the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) chaired the Committee and you, Mr. McWilliam assisted him. You are now in the Chair and the hon. Member for Congleton (Mrs. Winterton) will assist you. I am delighted to see that the post has been kept in the family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will deal with a long and complex Bill and we shall debate a wide range of issues. The Opposition do not think that the Bill provides an adequate response to the many housing needs that the country faces and we shall highlight the many problems and housing needs that are not being tackled properly. In particular, we shall highlight those provisions in the Bill that are retrograde and damaging. They include the measures on homelessness.

We shall aim to amend the Bill when it fails to deal with problems adequately and when there is a need to clarify or strengthen it. I suspect that many amendments will be tabled. The Bill shows signs of its rushed arrival in the House and, on Second Reading, the Minister revealed that at one stage it was heading towards having 380 clauses. Surgery was necessary to reduce it to its present not insignificant size of 180 clauses. Therefore, we know that last-minute pruning has taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many loose ends have not been well tied up and we anticipate the need for many amendments to rectify drafting problems. Indeed, the Government have already tabled a huge wadge of amendments and, even more remarkably for the first day in Committee, a huge wadge of Government amendments have been withdrawn before they have even been considered. We shall need to be eagle-eyed when we consider the detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part I of the Bill deals with the social rented sector. Opposition Members believe that the prime concern is the inadequate output of rented housing to meet the needs of all members of the community. The level of output of social housing has fallen in recent years to its lowest level since the end of the second world war. The figures published yesterday by the Minister's Department show the appalling collapse in the provision of housing in general and particularly in the provision of social housing in 1995. Total housing starts in the private sector and by housing associations and local authorities were down by 15 per cent. on 1994. Only 33,000 new housing association homes and a derisory 1,200 council homes were started last year. Fewer than 35,000 new homes were started in the whole of Great Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those figures demonstrate a wholly inadequate response to social housing needs. Anyone who has followed the issues over the years will have seen an appalling decline in the output of new housing for rent from housing associations and local authorities. We have reached the point where needs are simply not being met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition will articulate the need to expand the supply of social rented housing. That is best done through a range of different providers. Local authorities should once again be allowed to build homes for renting. Housing associations have an important role and social landlords—and non-profit-making organisations—who wish to provide accommodation to meet social needs should play an important role, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall not oppose the principle behind chapter I of the Bill, which establishes a register of social landlords that is wider than the existing Housing Corporation register, which is made up of housing associations only. However, some important points must be stressed. We strongly oppose the Government's original design to include profit-making organisations. Such a measure would have confused entirely the distinct roles of the profit-making private sector and of social housing providers, which should be non-profit-making organisations. We recognise and shall encourage the role of the private sector and I will discuss that later, but it has a distinct and separate role from that of social housing providers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are glad that the Government, albeit at the last minute, have recognised the error of their ways and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0010">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
withdrawn the proposal for profit-making companies to be eligible to be included in the register of social landlords. That proposal appeared in the White Paper published last summer. However, we understand that the Government may try to introduce another Bill in due course and that they may wish to return to that proposal. I would not wager my shirt on such a Bill reaching the statute book and I doubt whether many members from either side of the Committee would place a large bet on legislation going through at the tail end of this year if there has not been a general election by then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision in the Bill is rightly limited to non-profit-making organisations. Its Explanatory and Financial Memorandum states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"non-profit-making landlords may register with the Housing corporation".
<br><br><!-- lb --></p></blockquote>
We shall consider the precise definition of a non-profit-making landlord in more detail when we reach the relevant clauses. We fear that the Government may define the term in such a way that it does not meet the normal test that most people would have for non-profit-making organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 deals with the register of social landlords. Clause 1(1) requires the corporation to
	<br><blockquote><p>"maintain a register of social landlords".
<br><br><!-- lb --></p></blockquote>
Before the Housing Corporation takes that step, we must know what the register's purpose is. The aim of the amendment—I am sorry that I have taken a little time to reach this point in my remarks, but I hope that a modest digression is permissable, as it is the beginning of the sitting and we have not delayed the proceedings with lengthy speeches on sittings motions, as has happened in the past—is to ensure proper consideration of the need for social housing before the register is compiled. Clearly, there is no point in establishing a register in a vacuum. It would be laughable to produce a register and enable anyone, on the strength of a rough idea of entitlement, to be included. An initial appraisal should be carried out, embracing the need for social housing and examining the role of existing and potential providers of social housing, before the Housing Corporation reaches the stage of compiling its register. That would be a necessary and sensible start to the process. We should expect the Government to explain how they expect the process to be carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is self-explanatory. It would require the corporation, at the beginning of the process, to establish
	<br><blockquote><p>"criteria for registration in accordance with section 3(1)".
<br><br><!-- lb --></p></blockquote>
We shall in due course move amendments to clause 3(1), which sets out the criteria, but the principle of establishing criteria for registration at the outset is obvious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will find the amendment acceptable. It is tabled in a positive spirit of trying to improve the Bill. Elements of the Bill are objectionable and we will strongly oppose them, including the measures on homelessness, but we broadly agree with other features, and we shall try to improve them by amendment. Our amendments will be constructive. Amendment No. 3 sets the tone in that respect. We hope that Conservative Members will not blindly vote against
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
them merely because the Opposition have tabled them. I say that for two reasons. First, some Conservative Members expressed concerns on Second Reading about aspects of the Bill, such as the licensing of houses in multiple occupation. There may be common ground between the two sides of the Committee on the need to toughen the Bill with respect to those matters. We shall certainly try to make progress along those lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I advise Conservative Members that, before long, there will be a general election, after which those of them who remain in the House may be on the Opposition Benches. I should hate to think that they could spend many years—the rest of their parliamentary lives—seeing amendments rejected purely because of the side of the House on which they sit. It would be in their interest to adopt our spirit and seek constructive progress through the amendment of a Bill that, in many instances, needs significant changes and amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say at this stage that I allowed the hon.

However, after the Minister has spoken, I shall expect hon. Members to stick strictly to the amendments in hand, even though there may be a tendency to tempt providence from time to time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friends and I will be mindful of your injunctions. We are also pleased that Mrs. Winterton will support you in chairing the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Greenwich said, the Bill is complex and long, but in large part it does not raise issues of principle which divide us. We may perhaps wish that many of the clauses could be taken further, so there is an issue of degree, but not necessarily an issue of direction. The introductory clauses on housing companies and the regulation of houses in multiple occupation are typical of cases in which our differences are a matter of degree rather than of principle. Ensuring that tenants enjoy greater security from threats or intimidation and matters relating to leasehold reform are not matters of principle. I accept that there may be more to divide us when we consider the homelessness legislation, but I hope to show that there is more common ground even on that issue than people appreciate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the hon. Gentleman's hope that we can deal with the Bill constructively. There are many aspects of the issue—anti-social tenants, for example—in which we want to give people more security and get to grips with the problems, but none of us has absolute truth on our side and none can be certain that we have the immaculate remedy. I shall listen to the representations made and I invite my hon. Friends vigorously to take part in our debates, as we are trying to make changes that will be generally beneficial. I shall approach the Bill in that spirit.

Clause 1, and part I in general, deal with the diversification of the providers of social housing. We propose the establishment of housing companies. I pay tribute to the Chartered Institute of Housing, which has done much paving work to get the ideas up and running. The Government's proposals are not prescriptive—they deliberately allow organisations to form from the bottom up—which is generally welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am perplexed by the amendment, which is a paving amendment for amendment No. 6, on technical grounds. It is difficult to consider the amendment without referring to clause 2, to which amendment No. 6 applies, as amendment No. 3 does not have a freestanding life of its own. The hon. Gentleman may be able to help or he may say that he would prefer to move to amendment No. 6, which can be taken by itself, and the more substantive group of amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To clarify that point, the amendment is a paving amendment, but because it was selected in its own right as a free-standing amendment, I discussed it on that basis. We shall no doubt come to the details—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The selection of amendments is my responsibility. The amendment stands on its own, which is why it was selected separately. If hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no difficulty with the amendment, I was merely responding to the Minister's query. This amendment, like many of those tabled, is connected to others. Some are free-standing. Amendment No. 3 is connected to others and it is also a free-standing amendment in its own right. I hope that the Committee will consider it on that basis. We are setting out the case for the establishment of criteria in advance of the establishment of a register. The corporation should be clear about what it is trying to do and bodies that might consider applying for registration as social housing landlords should know what is expected of them and be aware of the criteria they must meet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the amendment seeks to do is already provided for in clause 3, which states that

It does not state "may establish".

The amendment is therefore redundant in this clause and I advise against accepting it on that basis, not because I am hostile to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am glad that we have not spent much time debating the sittings motion. When I first entered the House, I was shocked that right hon. and hon. Members spent a lot of time saying nice things to each other rather than getting on with business. I hope that you will allow me

the slight latitude that you allowed the Minister and the hon. Member for Greenwich, Mr. McWilliam, given that we are not spending much time on niceties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have various concerns about the Bill, which I expressed on Second Reading. I am worried that the closing date for the consultation that is taking place will be before the Committee finishes its consideration of the Bill, and may well be before the Bill has completed its passage through the House. I am also concerned that amendments are coming and going, and that important amendments on leasehold and the ability to deal with disorderly houses in multiple occupation have yet to be tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the constructive opening remarks made by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee on how we shall deal with this important Bill. I am concerned that it does not address many of today's housing issues, but I think that there is a lot of agreement between us about major issues such as HMOs, puting more money into social housing and landlords other than social landlords. We shall be spending a considerable amount of time trying to improve the Bill and I hope that we shall do so in a constructive spirit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today we are considering who may or may not be social landlords. My party's main concern is to ensure that people have responsible, decent landlords. To be a landlord in social housing requires skill; this country has a good record of social landlords who provide an excellent service, and we must ensure that that tradition continues. Therefore, I welcome the fact that we will be considering these provisions in some detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have come down with a heavy cold this morning, so I thought that it would be a good idea to speak early before my voice gives out completely. However, I now wonder whether that logic is the same as that which dictates that someone running out of petrol needs to speed up to get to the next petrol station.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich, I welcome the principle of the clause. I do not think that I shall say that about some of the other clauses, but perhaps we should leave that for another time. However, there is consensus on both sides of the Committee about the principle of regulation. It is important that the criteria for social landlords are clearly laid down and that we know what they are. I also—again, like my hon. Friend—welcome the fact that the Government have not in this Bill at least, unlike in the White Paper, sought to include profit-making private landlords in the register. However, we still need to consider in rather more detail how to define social landlords and an area's housing need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other day I was reading the housing investment programme bid from Birmingham city council in the 1996–97 financial year bidding round. A passage in section D.7.1 is particularly relevant when it comes to being clear what we mean by social landlords and the specific need that they must address. This passage is included in the section on working with private builders, which deals with the importance of the private
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0012">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
rented sector. It refers to the importance of private developers to building in the city, and goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In order to survive in a competitive market, private house builders must provide dwellings which meet market demands. However, a substantial proportion of the City's households are effectively excluded from the private housing market by their own economic circumstances. As a consequence, most of the dwellings provided by private builders do not directly meet the requirements of people in pressing housing need. This fact is reflected in the geographical distribution of house completions by tenure across the City. Over half of all the dwellings provided by housing associations between 1988 and 1995 were built within the Core Area,"—</p></blockquote>
the core area is an area defined for a particular housing need—
	<br><blockquote><p>"reflecting this tenure's needs-based approach. The equivalent figure for the private sector was under one quarter."</p></blockquote>
That illustrates the importance of housing associations in meeting social need, but if we are to expand the definition of the social landlord beyond housing associations—there is consensus in the Committee about that—we need to be clear that those organisations which come forward are able to meet that sort of need—the social rented sector is vital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Federation of Housing Associations has estimated that about 90,000 new social rented housing units are needed every year. In a way, that is the crux of the argument, which is not only about who is a social landlord, important though that is, but about the ability of landlords to create the scale of social housing that will be necessary in the coming year. As far as the Committee is concerned, that is the issue which dare not speak its name. The amendment is about ensuring that the correct organisations are classified, but if they do not have the means to create the new social housing units that are necessary, it will not matter who is classified and the real problem will not be tackled. There has been an omission, because the Bill contains nothing that will create any new homes. For a Bill dealing with housing, that is bizarre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The plain fact is that on current projections only about 50,000 or 51,000 units will be built in the coming year. That glaring omission makes it all the more important that we know precisely what we are talking about in relation to registering social landlords: they should be organisations that are in business to meet needs such as those of the Birmingham city council housing investment programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The creation of local housing companies, to which the Minister has referred, would be a valuable addition to housing provision, provided that, again, we know what we are talking about in relation to them. If all that the Bill is about is yet another scam and another way of privatising housing stock, it will be more connected with Conservative dogma than meeting housing need. Equally importantly, it will not be addressing the issue relevant to the social rented sector. Even if local housing companies do not meet the need, they need to go beyond housing and even housing and training matters. When we talk of poor housing, the lack of housing and homelessness, we are inevitably discussing employment, education, access to leisure facilities—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point, Mr. McWilliam.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
The amendment deals with the need for "criteria for registration" in local housing management. Those criteria should acknowledge the other factors which make an impact on meeting housing need, such as issues of leisure, crime and the environment. The make-up of housing companies and the sort of landlords whom we are seeking to register and regulate should reflect such needs and we should ensure that tenants and occupiers are fully involved in those aspects. Where appropriate, residents should have an opportunity to be involved in refurbishing housing stock for their own occupation. That is not just my view; in the White Paper, the Government considered the importance of housing in the context of overall regeneration policy. I should have thought that the Government would also consider that matter when developing the criteria for the classification of social housing landlords. However, I am not sure whether they will because the White Paper states that only about 40 per cent. of the single regeneration budget has been spent on housing-related projects. If that is the case, I see precious little evidence of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency decisions made under the single regeneration budget have ruled out some of the major housing projects proposed for Birmingham. Such projects could have met the sort of social housing need with which we are trying to deal when debating the clause and the amendment.

We must be told about the criteria on which the register will be based early in our deliberations. The criteria must take account of the reliability of social housing landlords and the extent to which such organisations have proven track records, which will be debated later. More importantly in the context of the amendment, the criteria should include a locally determined assessment of an area's housing need. That assessment should deal with various matters such as what social housing means in a certain area, how that relates to the area's broader economy and environment and how the particular social landlords registered under the clause fit into all that. Therefore, the amendment is important, and I hope that the Minister will change his opinion of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I know that the Minister is well aware of many of my constituency's problems. Taking note of the fact that my hon. Friend
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Burden) was called to order, I shall be brief and speak to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned the diversification of providers. The Government have a record of wanting to diversify and deregulate providers in other spheres, which creates opportunities for indiscretions—for example, what happened yesterday in the rail privatisation. A list of social housing providers would allow us to know their aims and objectives. According to Government dogma, owner-occupation is the only way forward. The Government do not have a strong track record in the provision of social housing, especially when local authorities are involved. As was mentioned earlier, local authorities built only 1,200 homes in the past 12 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister were to accept the amendment, Opposition Members would be reassured about some of the problems that other clauses could cause tenants. Nine thousand of my constituents are looking for a home, mainly in the social rented sector. I believe that 10,000 people objected to the White Paper. The Bill will be properly and fully scrutinised. If the Government accepted the Amendment, they would allay some of the fears that will arise. I hope that the Minister will tell us why the amendment is inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition will fully scrutinise the Bill. I hope that we can share our vision of what people in need should have in a civilised society—the right to live in a decent, warm home. We have the chance to ensure that the criteria and objectives for social housing are clear to everyone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hanson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I join my hon. Friends in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. McWilliam. My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe) summed up the reason for our amendment. We want to ensure that clear and easily defined criteria for inclusion in the social register are drawn up before the register is established. That is because there are many diverse needs for social housing in all constituencies. Those needs should be reflected in the criteria for registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, the hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Jones) is a member of the Committee, because he has the great honour to represent a Welsh seat. The main reason for wanting the registration criteria to be established prior to registration is the great diversity of need for social housing in Wales. I feel sure that the establishment of the criteria would assist in determining what social housing is needed and how best to reflect that need in the registration process. In Wales in 1994, there were 10,293 homeless families. There has been an increase of 107 per cent, in the past 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Changes in the amount and types of homelessness mean that clear aims and objectives need to be established soon, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South said, so that social housing organisations can reflect the existing needs in Wales. The past year has seen a 15 per cent. increase in Shelter
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Cymru's contacts with homeless people. Today, as on every day, 30 more dependent children in Wales will be put into a homeless unit, with their families being put in separate accommodation or in local authority housing units. Mortgage arrears in Wales have risen by 10 per cent. in the past year and more people are being evicted as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wales has a growing problem, identified by Shelter. The young are the fastest-growing group of homeless people. There is a greater and growing demand for diversity in social rented accommodation than there has been for many years. Shelter admits that the number of people under 25 in Wales with no fixed abode has risen to 10,000. That group is experiencing some form of homelessness or living in temporary accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In trying to establish criteria for inclusion in the register, we are seeking to explore what sort of rented accommodation and social housing is required. Many matters can be debated, which we shall come to in due course. The Minister's housing statistics for Wales show that in 1979, when the Labour party left office, 3,836 housing association dwellings were built. Last year, 2,885 were built. That limited statistic shows that there is scope to expand the criteria and the number of providers of social housing to meet a clearly established need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Homelessness in Wales has risen from 4,676 on the last day of the Labour Government to 10,341 today. At the same time there has been a decline in the construction of social housing units. Criteria for registration must be established early, to include as many social housing providers as possible. In my part of the United Kingdom, we need an expansion of cheap, reliable, efficient social housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will return to these matters frequently during our discussion of the Bill. It would be useful for us to hear from the Minister what he considers to be the aims and objectives of organisations that seek to Meet the criteria for registration, in accordance with the amendment tabled by my hon.

We are not creating a register; it already exists.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister has started the Committee in the style which those of us who recall previous housing Bill Committees remember all too clearly, by declining to accept Opposition amendments. I do not intend to press the amendment to a Division. We will try again; two more amendments that are relevant to the issue have been tabled for consideration on this clause, and I hope that the Minister will look more favourably on them. One of them deals in detail with the issues that should be listed in the register. We will return to the subject of criteria later. As we are keen to move forward, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>11.15 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 1, line 11, after 'office', insert 'and regional offices'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment relates to the availability of the register. The register must be maintained by the Housing Corporation. The terminology is interesting because the term "the Corporation" means the corporations, as it includes both the Housing Corporation and Tai Cymru. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) will vigorously pursue the issue of the accountability of Tai Cymru, on which there is much to be said. But it is an interesting curiosity that both bodies are referred to under the generic term "the Corporation", when most people reading the Bill would assume that it refers to the Housing Corporation in England only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause refers to both the Housing Corporation and Tai Cymru and requires them to
	<br><blockquote><p>"maintain a register of social landlords which shall be open to inspection at all reasonable times at the head office of the Corporation."</p></blockquote>
Everyone knows that the Housing Corporation is a quango. It has been set up by central Government,
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
dispenses very large amounts of public money and, on the whole, acts in accordance with the wishes of Ministers who take a close interest in how it operates. That is the line of accountability—it is run in a centralised way through Ministers to the House of Commons. The Housing Corporation is not seen by the outside world—certainly not those involved in housing matters—as an accessible and accountable body, in the sense of being responsive to the needs and aspirations of people, especially in the regions. Anyone who has talked to social housing providers, local authorities, housing associations and tenants will be aware of the extent to which the Housing Corporation is regarded as a remote and very centralised organisation. Key decisions are taken in London and handed down to be implemented by the regional offices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that staff in regional offices are doing their best to overcome the perception that the Housing Corporation is remote. They want to engage in creative dialogue with local housing associations, local authorities and others, including tenants, who have a direct interest in their work, but the culture of the organisation tends to work against that. It is a centralised organisation that operates from a head office, with regional offices which are, sadly, seen as akin to the offices of a colonial administration. The governor is the regional director who goes forth and tells the natives what the head office of the Housing Corporation says must be done. That is an anathema to us; it is wrong and it undermines the process of developing effective housing policies in each region, where there must be greater emphasis on meeting needs. Policies and housing initiatives that are the product of the regions must be developed from the expertise and understanding of local staff, rather than determined from on high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to break the culture of centralisation and try to make the regional offices of the Housing Corporation more accessible and more accountable to local people. The amendment would not do all of that, but it would help. It would make it clear that the register would be available for inspection in the regional offices of the Housing Corporation rather than only in the head office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that the amendment may be defectively drafted. On the surface, it appears to be satisfactory, but people who are more expert in the curiosities of the phrasing of legislation have said that it may contain a technical defect. If so, I happily accept that and throw myself on the Minister's mercy by asking him to table an amendment that is correctly drafted. We must insist on the principle and I hope that that principle will be agreed across the Committee. The register must be available for inspection not only in the head office but in all regional offices, so that people in every part of the country have the opportunity to see who is on the register and the crucial details of the organisations on it. That latter point will be dealt with in a subsequent amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is about decentralisation and subsidiarity, which is a principle that Conservative Members are only too happy to invoke in relation to European matters, but about which they are more diffident when it comes to matters within the United Kingdom. We believe in subsidiarity within the United
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
Kingdom, and in giving people opportunities to have more say and greater involvement locally. The amendment is a practical way forward to meet that objective, and I hope that the principle will be accepted even if the wording is felt to be defective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought for a minute that we were about to debate regional government, but I shall resist that temptation. The hon. Gentleman accepts that he was talking about more than the register, and that he was speaking about the principle of devolution of decision-making within the corporation. We agree that the corporation needs to be as unbureaucratic as possible and that it needs to be accessible, so that people feel that they are getting a good hearing and do not have to face too many unnecessarily formal steps when dealing with it. The chairman, Sir Brian Pearse, is certainly conscious of the need to make the Housing Corporation more user-friendly, and I have encouraged him in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may be able to meet the hon. Gentleman some of the way. He asks that the register be made widely available. If the register were compiled electronically, it should not be too difficult to transmit it to regional offices on the Internet—or by one of the similar methods that are so popular nowadays—so that it was accessible. However, the register is a bulky pile of documents. It includes annual accounts and much written information, so it is not readily transmissible. It consists of an awful lot of paper, and I find it difficult to accept that all of it should be replicated in all the corporation's regional offices. It is extraordinarily bulky, and not terribly user-friendly. There is a danger that there would be dislocations when it was brought up to date, because so much material would have to be physically moved around.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that regional offices hold essential information, such as a summary of what is on the central register and the most obviously important details of those who are registered. I am happy to consider whether we can come up with a formula that would provide such abbreviated information, but I do not believe that we should replicate all the information in all the regional offices. I hope that the hon. Gentleman feels that I am trying to meet him at least some way down the road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what the Minister has said and, before my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich responds, I should say that I welcome the approach that has been taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask the Minister about the purpose of the register and who it is aimed at. If placing a register in Tai Cymru's head office is simply a self-serving, do-gooder's exercise, the amendment is probably not needed. If, however, the register is meant to be a working source of information that can give people security and general warmth and tell them whether an organisation is appropriate and they can feel happy with it, or whether they need to question it, know more about its finances, membership, board, responsibilities, policies and objectives, it will work only if people have
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
access to it. Will the Minister say what the register's purpose is and what it will be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1(1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Corporation is required to maintain a register"</p></blockquote>
and to ensure that it is available for
	<br><blockquote><p>"inspection at all reasonable times at the head office of the Corporation."</p></blockquote>
That is all well and good but, if the register were aimed at local authorities, is it feasible for my local authority in north-east Wales to travel to Tai Cymru's headquarters to look at it? If the register were aimed at consumers, is it reasonable for my constituents who visit my surgeries on Friday or Saturday seeking socially rented accommodation to have access to that information? They probably do not even know where the Tai Cymru office is? Is it feasible for members of the public who might have a genuine interest in social housing to have to travel to the head office at a reasonable time determined by the corporation to view the register?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the Minister to explore such legitimate questions. What is the purpose of the register? Would it not be more appropriate for it to be decentralised in whatever shape or form that that can be carried out? For example, if I, as a constituent as opposed to a Member of Parliament, wish to look for a local social rented housing organisation in the register's entries, can I write to the Housing Corporation or to Tai Cymru for details? Can a local authority have copies of its own entries for its geographical area? Such matters are important. I am talking about access to the information, about being able to understand and assimilate the register and enabling those people who are interested in it to be able to use it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same argument applies to rights. They are important, but they only matter if people know what they are and how to use them. It is a nice right to develop a register of social landlords under the Bill, but if it simply sits on a shelf in the head office of Tai Cymru or the Housing Association, such an exercise is pointless. It must be available for people who want to use it. I do not know whether the register is aimed at local authorities, consumers, the general public, Members of Parliament or councillors, but if those people have to travel to a central point to gain access to it, it is pretty damn useless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister might say that I could talk to board members of the Housing Corporation about it. In my area, its eight board members include people such as Sir John Allen who is a member of three other quangos, Philip Pedley who is a market consultant for the Ford Motor Company, James Proctor who is a retired senior industrial manager, Michael Murphy who is a British Telecom manager, Robert Ellis who is a partner in Touche Ross and Julia White who is a librarian. My constituents do not necessarily know who those people are, where they live or have access to them. It is important to retain openness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must have a decentralised register. Obviously, board members are not representative of local people and people must have access to information. It is not the same as people asking their local Member of Parliament or councillor for information. The Tai Cymru board is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0016">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
not accountable to local people; it is accountable directly to the Under-Secretary of State. The Undersecretary of State, the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison), has a habit of appointing people who he knows to the Board. Phil Pedley is one of my constituents and has just been reappointed to the board of Tai Cymru as its deputy chairman. He is a former Conservative councillor in the Wirral metropolitan borough council, which happens to be in the same constituency as the right hon. Member for Wirral, West (Mr. Hunt), who was the Secretary of State for Wales when Mr. Pedley was first appointed to the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Pedley has now moved to Mold in my constituency. He has twice been a parliamentary candidate and has now been reappointed to the board. Yet he is described as a marketing director for the Ford Motor Company. If I wanted to find out about the register at central headquarters, could I, as a fellow constituent, refer the matter to him? Do I even know what he does on my behalf? In appointing Mr. Pedley again to the board, the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, the hon. Member for Cardiff, North, seems to have created a precedent because Mr. Pedley's predecessor was the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Evans) prior to his election to the House. There is a need for a register and for decentralisation, so that individuals can have access to the register and can understand it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could go on for ever, Mr. McWilliam, but I fear that I would be called out of order. I can already see twitchings on the Government Benches, so I shall return to the matter of accountability on another day. It is important to discover the register's purpose. We want to know whether it is meant to be dry and dusty—on Internet, which I could not access, or on a shelf, which I could—or whether it has a genuine local use. If it is the latter, how will people who need to use it be able to access the information without having to trek to London or Tai Cymru's headquarters, to make long and tortuous telephone calls, or to write to gain access to the information that I presume the Minister wants them to have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is about openness, accountability and decentralisation. We shall return to those themes time and again. My initial reaction was to ask what the Minister could object to. We now have regional offices—I realise that that is not regional Government, and I welcome the fact that Labour Members have joined us in wanting some form of regional Government—so I was shocked to hear the Minister say that the real problem was administrative convenience. Democracy and accountability are not always convenient, but they are important; which is one reason why I belong to the Liberal Democrats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the fact that the Minister is considering easier ways of providing information. I hope that he will go further. If we are to convince people about the opening up of social housing and about housing companies, we should start as we mean to go on. Being open about the matter is important not only to the new social landlords, but to those who genuinely want to know what it could mean to the social housing sector. I

The hon. Member for Greenwich referred to colonial Government. He implied that it was for the governor of the colony to visit the various parts of the colony to declare what head office had decided. That seems to be a rewriting of imperial history. One of the glories of our tradition was the degree of independence and authority held by the district commissioner. Before you rule me out of order, Mr. McWilliam, let me say that I intervene only to demonstrate to the hon. Member for Greenwich that some Conservative Members still hang on his words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am somewhat intrigued by the picture created by the hon. Member for Delyn of the hundreds of his constituents who have to trek to Cardiff, London or elsewhere to gain information. I was not aware of a vast, unsatiated demand for the names and addresses of those who sit on the boards of housing associations and other potential players in that field. I have an element of scepticism about that. It may help if I spell out what is on the register, what other information is widely available that is not a requirement for the register, and which information goes beyond the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The register of housing associations maintained by the Housing Corporation currently contains the following information: the registration number; the date of registration; the name of the association; the registered office address; the correspondence office address; and the number and date of the Housing Corporation's minute confirming registration. I shall be happy to let the hon. Gentleman have a copy to save him scribbling notes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other information that is available alongside the register, but not on it, are the rules of the housing association; the last two years' accounts; the solicitor's name; the auditor's name; the subsidiary or parent organisation's details; agency arrangements; the names and professional qualifications of members of the committee, trustees, secretary, treasury, clerk and senior staff; and the disclosure of interests and other details. Therefore, a wide range of material is already available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about having to duplicate a large volume of physical material in different places across the country. I have said that I am willing to consider making the basic information on the housing associations in the region—the first part that I read out—available in regional offices. The larger housing associations operate in virtually all the regions, but some have a regional characteristic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that the hon.

I shall be willing to consider whether an abbreviated version, which gives all the essentials, could be made available, so that if local people need more substantial information, the regional office could be charged with obtaining it from the central office. It would be a matter of acquiring the necessary files and transmitting them. I do not think that most people would expect the information to be available instantly at the regional office, but if they gave notice, I am sure that it could be obtained. I shall reflect on that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

One of my most difficult tasks as a Member of Parliament is when a constituent tells me that he is moving to another part of the country and wants to start negotiations for a transfer.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the risk of incurring your displeasure, Mr. McWilliam, I want to briefly touch on matters that we shall return to when we are discussing amendment No. 5. Clearly, our purpose in moving the amendment is to focus on the importance of certain information about the association being part of the register. If information is to be made available in regional offices, I hope that it is not restricted to only the items that the Minister listed, such as the registration number of the organisation, the date of its registration, its name, registered office, corresponding address and the Housing Corporation minute confirming its registration. Such information may be helpful, but it is not the essence of what local people want to know about the organisation. The hon. Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock) rightly stressed that we are talking about openness, accountability and devolution. That means that the bodies concerned should make available items such as the annual report, the accounts, policies and the name of board members and senior staff. That is the kind of information that members of the public are likely to want. I should have thought it possible that the copy of the register—which will be maintained regionally, if the Minister's offer is taken up—could embrace some of those key documents, such as the
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
annual report and accounts, which will contain the list of board members. That is what people will want, and we should ensure that they have access to that information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for saying that he will consider the spirit, if not the letter, of the amendment, but I want to be certain that he will deliver on his promise. Many of us have read with interest an article that appears in this week's issue of 
	<i>Inside Housing,</i> containing a fascinating biography of the Minister. It tells us all sorts of interesting things about him, some of which we may come back to, but I noted with particular trepidation the final paragraph, in which an unnamed campaigner, who clearly gets on with the Minister, is reported as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Personally I find him straightforward, and he seems to take on board the arguments".
<br><br><!-- lb --></p></blockquote>
Fine, we have had evidence of that this morning, which is very welcome. The unnamed campaigner goes on to say, however:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My worry is that he doesn't deliver … He's an intellectual"—</p></blockquote>
that will not endear him to his hon. Friends—
	<br><blockquote><p>"but he's not a forceful minister. He's not able to change Gummer's mind and as a team they consistently lose their battles with the Treasury."</p></blockquote>
We shall return to some of the other features of that interesting article, but I want to feel sure that the Minister will deliver and that there will be not just a copy of the bureaucratic information on an organisation's number and registered office address but basic information on the social housing providers, including their annual reports, accounts and other information that ordinary members of the public will want on who is running an association, its policies and how it will operate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman wants me to respond. I learnt a great deal from the article. I discovered, for example, that I was a rich Methodist; I had always known that I was a Methodist, but that was the first time that I discovered the extent of my wealth. If the person who discovered my wealth could identify where I could find it, I should be infinitely grateful for his researches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to being described as an intellectual, there may have been, as the hon. Member for Greenwich suggested, regimes under which that would have been an absolutely fatal attribute, but I hope that politics have moved on a little, and that to be caught with books is not necessarily regarded as being a fatal handicap to one's future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to my specific undertaking, it would be sensible for me to discuss with the chairman and chief executive of the Housing Corporation what information they have that can be made readily available and will not demand an enormous bureaucratic paperchase, but which can be made accessible and can be easily transmitted. I shall come back to the Committee when I have formed a view in discussions with the Housing Corporation. That is pragmatic and sensible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am delighted that we have arrived at the amendment in such an orderly fashion, Mr. McWilliam, avoiding the need for you to rap our knuckles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment goes to the nub of clause 1, and concerns what will be included in the register. The Minister has already given us an interesting insight when he described, conjuring up a Dickensian image, what went on in the vaults of the Housing Corporation, where there seem to be shelf upon shelf of dusty papers, most of which will never be referred to by anyone—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I might as well tell the Committee now that I strongly object to sedentary interventions. They are usually not as fully as they were intended to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly bear that in mind for future reference, Mr. McWilliam, not having been the guilty party on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The image of the Housing Corporation's register is curious and tends to reinforce the widespread worry that the corporation is a secretive and centralised organisation that is not as accessible as it should be, with lots of information hidden in the vaults. We must change that. We have discussed the importance of the register being accessible. I am grateful to the Minister for his offer to come back on the question of what it will be practical to make available in the regions. We have made progress on the possibility of making useful information available through regional offices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ensure that the register is a comprehensive statement of what people need to know about the social landlords. That is the purpose of the amendment. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The register shall include for all registered social landlords details of their—".
<br><br><!-- lb --></p></blockquote>
A list of various elements follows, which I will explain briefly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first element is
	<br><blockquote><p>"accounts for the previous three years".
<br><br><!-- lb --></p></blockquote>
From what the Minister told me, under the existing arrangements accounts for the previous two years are held, but that is not mandatory. It should be mandatory and the accounts should cover a three-year period. Two years is a relatively short time and the fortunes of housing associations and other social landlords can fluctuate. There is a case for a slightly longer period than two years—I would argue for three years. Accounts are crucial for anyone interested in the composition and health of an organisation's finances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
Secondly, the register should contain "summary performance information". I hope that the Government will not resist that. They have spoken frequently about the importance of performance indicators in a range of activities. Performance information about housing associations and other social housing providers is an important means for members of the public to find out how those bodies are operating and to make comparisons between them. Such information is an essential element in a meaningful register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third item specified in the amendment is
	<br><blockquote><p>"the names of board members and senior officers".
<br><br><!-- lb --></p></blockquote>
We could have included professional qualifications, but those appear on the informal, non-mandatory list to which the Minister referred in the debate on the previous amendment. We heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn how certain people who happen to be friendly to Ministers or who have connections with their political party can find their way on to the boards of quangos. We know about this aspect of the quango state—the appointment of people who have the right connections. It is important that the public should be aware. Openness about the names of board members and senior officers is a crucial element in a meaningful register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth element is the "key policies" of the organisation. There must be a statement of the policies of the provider of social housing so that anyone inspecting the register can learn what the organisation sees as its main objectives, and can compare its performance with its stated policies. Too often, organisations espouse high-sounding objectives and set out their stall in an extremely impressive way, but fail to deliver. I have already referred to summary performance indicators. It should be possible to compare the performance with the policies that the organisation believes it is seeking to implement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fifth element is more technical—the "rules" of the organisation. It is important that the rules governing the organisation—whether it is an industrial and provident society or a company limited by guarantee—should be made available so that, for example, those who want to raise matters at annual general meetings know the framework of such meetings and can participate in them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So a statement of the rules should be an important element of the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next matter for inclusion in the register is "application for registration". That seems relatively similar to what the Minister mentioned in his response to the debate on the previous amendment. He said that the minutes of the Housing Corporation recording the registration of a housing association was already a matter for inclusion in the register under the Bill. However, the application form itself might not be included. Anyone inspecting the register should have an opportunity to read the statement that the landlord made at the time of application. Although that is important, I would not want to discourage the inclusion of the Housing Corporation minute. The registration application and the minute should appear together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final item listed in the amendment is "annual reports." We have not stated the number of annual
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
reports that should appear. Common sense suggests that the number of reports included should be similar to that for annual accounts—at least the last three years' reports. People should have an opportunity to inspect those reports to see how an organisation has done and how it has presented itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quality of annual reports produced by housing associations has improved considerably in recent years. Both the Minister and I have officiated at the prize-giving ceremony for the best annual reports. That useful annual competition provides a stimulus for housing associations to produce good quality reports. The standard of presentation has improved remarkably in recent years. I hope that a requirement that annual reports to be included in the register will be a further incentive not only to housing associations but to other social landlords to present themselves in an informative and attractive way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the key items to which I have referred should be included in the register. We do not pretend that the list is absolutely comprehensive. Undoubtedly, other items, such as those that the Minister mentioned, could also be included in the list. If the register is to be meaningful and if it is to give helpful information to those who want to know about the landlords that are registered, we must ensure that at least the elements listed in the amendment are included in the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the constructive spirit that has so far been achieved in Committee, I hope that the Minister will agree either to accept the amendment or to consider its principle and ensure that those key elements are made available in the register held not only at the Housing Corporation's head office but at regional offices, for inspection by those who want to know about the activities of social landlords.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Greenwich is an authority on these matters, which I would not remotely pretend to be. He implied that some of the requirements listed in the amendment would not be mandatory for individual social registered social landlords. For the purposes of both the Companies Act 1989 and the relevant charities legislation, it is difficult to persuade companies and charities to file their information on time. The amendment states that the register should include certain information, but it does not state what would happen if a particular social landlord did not provide it. In the absence of a mandatory penalty on the registered social landlord, what would happen if the Housing Corporation did not have such information? If the amendment were accepted, would the Opposition table a subsequent amendment that, in such circumstances, a landlord should be removed from the register?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South asked an important question about the sanction for non-compliance. When we debate clause 4, we shall deal with the procedures under which the Housing Corporation can remove organisations from the register if it were not satisfied with their performance. That will be the ultimate
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
sanction if an organisation fails to comply with the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the event of a delay, for example, other steps can be taken to avoid that drastic response. That would be through the normal Housing Corporation procedures. It monitors associations regularly and could speak to the relevant chief executives and refer matters to the committee saying that there had been a breach and what sanctions would apply if there were a persistent breach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existing framework has adequate mechanisms for dealing with non-compliance, but I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for raising the matter because it has wider implications than just those for social housing landlords. I hope that he will accept that mechanisms exist and that there are appropriate sanctions against non-compliance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The starting point is the existing register. It works. I have not been inundated with people telling me that it does not work, that it is inadequate and that it is not an effective tool. We are not bailing out a system that has failed. We are trying to extend it and bring in new providers. As we have said, the housing associations move automatically on to the new register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A register is a statement of legal eligibility. People who meet certain criteria are eligible to bid for funding, for example, to provide houses, to be recipients in transfers and to perform certain housing activities. I do not believe that the register was ever intended to be a qualitative account of those people, but simply to state that they were eligible. A mass of information about the organisations, especially those that are well-established, exists alongside what is on the register. I agree with the hon. Member for Greenwich that the presentation of accounts and their accessibility have improved enormously. Increasing numbers of people who have useful professional skills to bring to the work are becoming members of the boards of housing associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirements might be technically difficult for some organisations, particularly new bodies. A new housing company will not have any accounts to present and, thus, will not be able to fulfil the requirements of the amendment. I am willing to examine whether the present requirements for registration are adequate and whether it is possible to add certain criteria—to see if we can at least go some way to meeting the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not anxious to turn the registration process into a shopping list of housing associations or into a process by which we can judge their relative qualities. I want to ensure that the register says whether an organisation is fit to take part in a particular sector. However, in discussion with the Housing Corporation and perhaps the National Federation of Housing Associations, certain factors could be brought in to amplify that process. In the spirit of the previous amendment, I am willing to examine that possibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to my hon. Friend the Membr for Greenwich. Why does the information that the Minister wants to make available at regional offices not exist at present? It is difficult to understand how regional offices can function without the names of board members and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0020">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
senior officers being available. How can they function without key policies being available?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12 noon</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that matters need to be clarified. The question is whether such details should appear on a formal, legal document called the register. The information to which the hon. Gentleman referred is extensively available and I have no doubt that a regional office of the Housing Corporation, for example, would already have available a large amount of such documentation. Moreover, the accounts and annual report of the housing associations give such details. We must consider whether it is necessary to transpose such information into the form of the register. I do not want to give the impression that the information is not available—it is available. The question is the legal shape that it should take.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's intervention. We are trying to extract from him what is available at regional offices and how they will function when people wish to obtain information concerning the rules, policies, applications for registration and the annual accounts. The Minister said that such information already exists? Is there any reason why it should not be mandatory for it to be included in the register? He said that it would be bulky and difficult for people to wade through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department has the facilities to ensure that such information is readily available. It could be indexed so that people have easy access to it. Over the past few years, the provision of housing through housing associations and social landlords has mushroomed. If circumstances do not change, it could increase further and it is important that such information is available at the most local point possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely it is part of the Government's policy to ensure that people have access to information which, in many instances, could control their destinies. It is difficult, therefore, to understand why the Minister objects to making it a mandatory requirement that such details are included in registers at regional offices. It would be easy for an official to say that information was not available at a certain time and that he or she would provide it at a later date. If it were already included in the register, a person could demand to have access to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that some information is available that is ancillary to the register, the Minister should think again. The amendment is constructive, it is not destructive. Let us consider those people who rely on information about the way in which social landlords operate. The Minister would be doing many people a good service if he included such items on the register. That would be of such importance to those who have an interest in housing, especially the provision of social housing. Against the backcloth of the need for information, there would be tremendous value in the Minister accepting the amendment. I appeal to him to think carefully, because to reject it would do a disservice to many of those interested in social housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich that it was wrong to
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
say that the existing register did not work. Within its limits of operation, I am sure that that is true. The question is whether a register should be merely a statement of the current legal position, with a limited audience. I suggest not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also said that the Housing Corporation was not secretive. I know that in several regional offices, efforts are being made not to be secretive. Housing specialists, local authorities, Members of Parliament and others know precisely what the Housing Corporation is, but the majority of people do not. When I try to explain to my constituents some of the vagaries of current Government housing policy and speak about the Housing Corporation, they often imagine that I am talking about the local council—as if the Housing Corporation is the housing department of the council. If we are serious about opening up the Housing Corporation and trying to make more information available to those who need it, we should expand the register. There should be more information, but the register must ensure transparency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the previous amendment, amendment No. 5 is about devolution and accountability. The Housing Corporation currently provides grants to social landlords of about £1 billion a year. If the proposals in the Bill are accepted, there will be a greater range of social landlords. With that amount of public money being spent, it should be possible, as a right of citizenship, for people to know who receives that money and to be able to gain information about the performance of landlords and the other factors mentioned in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb --></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>[Mr. Andrew F. Bennett 
	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>

	<p>The Minister said that much of that information was already available, but it is not mandatory to make it public. It does not have to be published. Information about accounts for the previous three years, business performance and the policies of those bodies is not readily available. That information should be available now. If we are to expand the definition of a social landlord, it is not unreasonable to want to know what sort of shape they are in, or to ask for accounts for the previous three years. Summary performance information tells us how successful the social landlords have been in providing services to their tenants. Politicians would certainly need such information, as would the Housing Corporation. It is also important that individual citizens should be able to obtain that information.
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>

	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Delyn spoke about the board members and senior officers of the Housing Corporation and made a good case, but similar factors apply to social landlords. People should be able to discover who runs those organisations and what else they are involved in. I particularly echo the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich about the policies of those organisations and the important links between social housing and regeneration policies generally. We also need to know whether the landlords' policies are just wish lists—something that looks good on paper—or are reflected in their track record for at least three years. If that is not the case, it may be right to give a social landlord large amounts of public money,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0021">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
but that needs to be questioned, not just by people who already have access to the information, but by anyone who has an interest. In other words, the information should be available to everyone. That is why we believe that the information is important.
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>

	<p>[Mr. John McWilliam 
	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>

	<p>The Minister has gone some way to acknowledging that by saying that the information should to a large extent, be available in regional offices. If it has been found that it needs to be available in practice, it is not unreasonable to ask that availability be codified and made mandatory. If social landlords are bona fides and try to fulfil the performance criteria that we all want, they will not object to providing the kind of information that the amendment would require. The amendment would be welcomed by responsible social landlords. If the register is to be effective, we must ensure that it is mandatory to provide the information, not voluntary.
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill provides for a variety of social landlords, so it is important that we have the mechanisms to regulate them because, as the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield said, we will be giving them large amounts of public money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is little dispute among members of the Committee about whether we want information to be available to people. The argument lies in whether that should be mandatory and included in the Bill. I do not doubt the Minister's integrity, but we all know that Ministers come and go, which is why I believe that the provision of information should be prescribed in the Bill. The amendment would require very much a minimum list, and if the register is to have any real meaning and enable us to provide decent social housing, that list should be included in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sutcliffe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the Minister is in good faith and wants information to be available, as he has already said that the information should be accessible in a readable and understandable form to anyone who requires it. I do not understand, however, why the Government do not accept that the amendment would provide an appropriate checklist that would enable people spending public money to be held accountable. Other programmes, such as the single regeneration budget and city challenge, place such requirements on organisations when they put in their bids.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the early part of our proceedings, we are trying to get at the core of the Bill and at the Government's strategy. We accept that the Government want to increase the number of providers of social housing, but we want to ensure that the providers are properly eligible to receive public money That is what is most important to the people who will be tenants. They want organisations that are credible and meet the tests that are imposed. As to having three years of accounts, I accept that some of the organisations will be new, but tenants will want to know their financial background, whether finance will be available and what the performance could and should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich said, there has been a quangoisation of organisations, and it is
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
important that we establish what the relationships are between people on those bodies and how they interrelate with other sectors. We want to know how an organisation's policy will fit into the housing strategy and local needs of an area. The Government say that the Bill is about creating and developing extra provision, so we hope that they want the new social landlords to develop partnerships with other bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cuts in grant have resulted in amalgamations in the housing association sector. Smaller housing associations have been combined with larger ones, sometimes to the detriment of people with special housing needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirements that we are suggesting are sensible, and will give confidence to people who work in the housing sector, so that they know that we are looking for credible social landlords, who want to increase provision to meet housing needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.15 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Demands for information always seem to be eminently reasonable; it is difficult to say that they will not get us anywhere. I always ask myself what is the problem that we are trying to solve. However, I am not satisfied that there is a problem to solve in this instance. We all accept that the amendment would not add to the information that is available. The question is whether information should be placed on the register and presented in a certain legal form. I am not convinced that that would be useful, although I appreciate the Opposition's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is access to such information through housing associations, which are more and more open, and through the National Federation of Housing Associations, Regional offices hold a large amount of non-statutory information about the people with whom they work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not convinced that the quality of a landlord is relevant to the question of eligibility. However, it will affect a landlord's success when bidding for funds and undertaking housing activities. In a competitive market, questions about a landlord's track record become important when deciding who has successfully pursued a policy. So quality is relevant to the point of delivery, not to registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should remind the Committee that, in later debates, we shall deal with some of the matters that hon. Members have mentioned. For example, there might be a proposal that the Audit Commission should conduct one of its value-for-money investigations into housing associations, just as it already investigates local authorities and as it can now investigate health authorities under measures recently agreed by the House. The ombudsman will also have a statutory function on housing associations so many of the Opposition's legitimate anxieties will be dealt with effectively under other parts of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall repeat the offer that I made in the debate on the previous amendment. If it is helpful, I will discuss with the Housing Corporation what relevant information could be placed on the register to make that document somewhat fuller than it is at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, I am inclined to take a benign view of the world, accept the Minister's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0022">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
intentions and withdraw the amendment in the spirit of amity that has prevailed so far, but first, I shall press him further on one or two issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rightly highlighted what is technically required for a register and stated that access involved different issues. I am not sure that the public see it in that light. I have no doubt that the Housing Corporation will want to be helpful and I hope that the Minister will have constructive discussions with it. I have the greatest respect for Sir Brian Pearse, the corporation's chairman, and for Anthony Mayer, its chief executive. I am certain that they will want to be positive and helpful, but they do not necessarily see the position from the public's point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sometimes, members of the public are not entirely confident that the powers that be are accessible, or that they are helping them to pursue legitimate concerns. It is easy to envisage circumstances in which tenants might feel uncomfortable about their housing association landlord. They might not have a good relationship with their association and, therefore, want separate access to information. They might have had a row about a failure to undertake repairs, a disputed rent account or any of the nitty-gritty issues of housing management which sometimes go wrong and lead to conflict between landlords and tenants. In such circumstances, it is entirely understandable that an association's tenants might want to go to another body for information. They might want to complain to the ombudsman or take legal action. So it is important that such information is accessible to the public in a helpful form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Northfield mentioned housing association takeovers and mergers, which have been going on in recent years. It would be surprising if there were not more in the years ahead. Tenants of an association who hear that their association is about to be swallowed up by another one may justifiably want to obtain information about their future landlord, and they may want to consult an independent source. That is another example of the legitimate concerns of people who want information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We take the view that a spirit of openness is vital. There should not be a purely technical process of registration. The register must be seen as a basis for information that is useful and helpful to members of the public in forming a view about the performance, intentions and bona fides of registered social landlords. If the Minister can assure us that, having discussed the matter with the Housing Corporation, his response will take that on board, as well as the technical matters, I will be happy to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks. This is an open field. No one, as far as I am aware, has dark secrets to conceal. Certain development plans of associations may be confidential and not open to inspection, but I will conduct my discussions with a view to achieving the maximum accessibility, bearing in mind that some of the people who may inquire may not be experts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a short, preliminary clause which establishes the register of social landlords. We have discussed amendments that focus mainly on subsection (1)—the duty on the corporation to maintain the register and to make it available for inspection. Subsection (2) deals with the process whereby existing registered housing associations are automatically transferred to the new register. We have not debated that and I want to raise various points of concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that existing housing associations that have satisfied the registration criteria should not have to go through the cumbersome, tortuous process of re-registration. That is straightforward, but subsection (2) is too automatic. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On the commencement of this Part every housing association which immediately before commencement was registered under Part I of the Housing Associations Act 1985 shall be registered as a social landlord."</p></blockquote>
No doubt that is appropriate in the vast majority of cases, but I should like the Minister to give us some information about the total number of registered housing associations. There are probably thousands; there are certainly many hundreds of registered housing associations, and they come in a variety of sizes and shapes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The variety of the housing association movement is one of its strengths. Many of us who have been associated with it over the years have admired that diversity, which ensures that the movement does not become complacent and does not focus on only a limited number of tasks, but has a broad view of the need for social housing and is innovative in its approach to problems
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are, however an enormous number of very small associations that are, to all intents and purposes, dormant. They do not seek housing association grant, which will be renamed social housing grant in the relevant clause. They are not developing, and probably manage only a small number of properties—perhaps five, 10 or in some cases fewer. They are dormant players in the housing association movement. I do not belittle their contribution, which is often important in their community, but they will not be significant players in the development of new social housing. The vast majority of tenants will not want to look up the details of such organisations in the register, and those organisations will not want to take over or merge with other associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether it is appropriate for the single, comprehensive register to continue to embrace those bodies as well as associations that have 20,000 properties, that have developed large programmes with a series of subsidiaries, that have partnership agreements with various private sector bodies and local authorities or even associations with regional offices in every part of the country. Such organisations are on a completely different scale. It is a little questionable for a single register to cover both extremes—and, of course, an enormous range in the middle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would therefore welcome an indication of whether the register should continue in its present monolithic
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0023">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
form or whether there is scope for some subdivisions for the different categories. It is in the public interest that more detailed and more acceptable information should be available about the larger associations that are the major players in the development process. A case can be made to divide the register into two or more registers to distinguish the various categories of association, providing information appropriate to the scale of association and its activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that this is a somewhat detailed, technical matter, and that it may be boring to many members of the Committee. I am slightly apprehensive in pressing the matter because the article to which I referred earlier mentions the Minister. Much of it is quite nice to him, but there is a little sting in the tail. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Curry is credited with being a realist who occasionally lets his boredom with housing show through."</p></blockquote>
We have not seen that boredom this morning; I hope that we will not see it during the Committee stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will not feel that I am raising boring, technical matters. They are important matters to those who are interested in the future well-being of the housing association movement and social housing generally. They go beyond the current position and lead us to consider the likely future of the social housing movement during the last years of this century and the start of the next. They give us an idea of what will be the most appropriate mechanisms to ensure the delivery of good quality, affordable housing to people in need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How the register operates, what distinctions are made between existing associations and new landlords, and what distinctions are made between different categories of landlord—large, medium and small; those meeting general needs and those meeting special needs—are all relevant to the future of the housing association and central housing-landlord movement. I hope that the Minister will say how he envisages the register—the nub of clause 1—developing in the years ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to return to that famous article. I do not know whether you, Mr. McWilliam, can have it read into the record of the Committee's proceedings. I am not used to receiving such singular attention. Some nice things have been said about me, so I must read it. I complain only that it attributed to me the ability to commute daily from somewhere near Bordeaux to Paris. Those who tried it would discover that even as the 
	<i>Financial Times</i> correspondent in Paris, it is not a particularly practical commute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Greenwich has demonstrated that there is a large measure of agreement on clause 1. The hon. Gentleman is right in what he says. In answer to his specific question, about 2,220 housing associations are registered. Of those, 380 are developers, that develop on a regular basis. Performance indicators are published for developers. About 1,200 associations have 50 homes or fewer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: About 1,200 associations have 50 or fewer homes. They are, to all intents and purposes, dormant. We must be clear that that is not the same as moribund. Some housing associations go back to the middle ages. They are an ancient foundation. It is a mistake to believe that they are a recent creation. Although some recent associations are very large, some are minnows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Greenwich specifically asked whether the register was a biblical text that could not change, develop over time or contain new information and whether it could differentiate between categories. I do not conceive the register as having the quality of immutability. I expect that will change and develop in the same way as information technology makes information more accessible. We must take advantage of that. The Housing Corporation is not meant to be a Kremlin, the workings of which are carried out in secret. We want it to be as open and accessible as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing associations should feel that their applications are dealt with sensibly, flexibly and with accessibility. It is an organisation that is spending public money, so we must ensure that the rules governing it are clear. We do not envisage that it should have a mindset about how it goes about its business. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that we intend that the process should be, in a sense, organic and that, when it becomes obviously sensible to make a change, we will make a change. That is part of the Housing Corporation's mandate and part of its regular scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, when the Audit Commission investigates housing associations, some of the messages that it receives will be useful for the Housing Corporation and the housing associations. They will no doubt act on such advice because people have generally found the Audit Commission's recommendations to be extremely helpful in terms of practical management tools, which is the object of the exercise. I finish my remarks on what I hope, Mr. Mawhinney, is a note of relative harmony. I hope that the clause will remain unamended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments to which my hon. Friends spoke this morning seemed to be concerned with extra information. I was a little reluctant to intervene, but I have some reservations about extra information. It is important that housing associations have annual reports, that all information is available to them and that I, as a Member of Parliament, have access to it. My strong plea to those members of housing association boards who read the 
	<i>Hansard</i> reports of our sittings is that they do not insist on sending me their annual reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I served on the Environment Select Committee when it considered the Housing Corporation. Naturally, we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0024">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
examined a fair number of housing associations. There seems to be a law, which does not apply only to housing associations, under which organisations order, say, 1,000 copies of their annual report, but mistakenly receive 2,000 copies. It is then somewhat embarrassing that the extra annual reports are stuck on the shelf. Someone asks what can be done with them, to which the response is, "Send them to Members of Parliament. They will be interested." Most hon. Members then receive in their post annual reports from such organisations. A large proportion of them put the reports straight into the waste paper basket.

Those of us who are slightly more conscientious put the reports in a pile, intending to read them at some time in the future. Each three or four months we then clear the whole pile into the waste paper bin. My further plea is that information is useful in the right place. If I had housing associations in my constituency that were doing a good job, and I wanted information, it would be very helpful to be able to ring them up and ask for a copy of their annual report, a list of members or similar information, but it is not helpful to have a copy of their
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
annual report posted to me. The reports may have been improved, and made to look more attractive, but it is totally unrealistic to expect Members of Parliament regularly to read through those documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make a plea, not just to housing associations but to almost every organisation: please do not send me annual reports. The organisations that I find particularly annoying at the moment are those that send me their environmental statements about how good they are; but one needs only to think of all the trees that have been cut down to produce their annual reports. I make the simple plea: information should be in the right place, but not heading for my postbox.
