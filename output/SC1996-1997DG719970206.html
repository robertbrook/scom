	<div class='legislation'>Draft Race Relations (Northern Ireland) Order 1997</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Michael Ancram)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Race Relations (Northern Ireland) Order 1997.</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the order is to apply to persons belonging to ethnic groups who live and work in Northern Ireland similar protection to that which already applies under the Race Relations Act 1976 to those of us who live and work in the rest of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The absence of race relations has not been due to any lack of will on the part of successive Governments. We must acknowledge, however, that over the past few years, the political debate in Northern Ireland has, for obvious reasons, centred more on fair employment issues between the two communities. There was also the matter of proportionality. In recent years there has been a significant increase in the number of people in ethnic minority groups. However, the total number is approximately 0.5 per cent. of the population. It was only in the late 1980s that a public debate on the need for such legislation began. In 1995, the Secretary of State gave a commitment to introduce race relations legislation to Northern Ireland as soon as possible. This debate is evidence of that commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will describe the main provisions of the order. With the exception of the inclusion of the Irish traveller community, which has been defined as an ethnic group for the purpose of this legislation, the order follows the same general lines as the Race Relations Act 1976.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order defines both direct and indirect discrimination and makes them unlawful. It also extends the definition of discrimination to cover the victimisation of an individual who has, for example, exerted his or her rights under the order. Important in the Northern Ireland context is the inclusion of the definition of "racial grounds" and "racial group". That has been necessary to distinguish between discrimination on the grounds of race and that on the grounds of religious belief or political opinion. In Northern Ireland, the latter is covered by the provision of the fair employment legislation, which is another reason for the delay in introducing this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Legal redress under the order lies, in employment cases, with the industrial tribunals and, in other cases, with the county courts. In line with existing anti-discrimination legislation, there is no upper limit to the level of compensation that can be awarded to a victim of racial discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order places a duty on district councils in Northern Ireland to carry out their various functions with due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful racial discrimination and
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
to promote equality of opportunity between persons of different racial groups. In the equivalent provision of the Race Relations Act 1976, that duty is placed on local authorities, which have wider responsibilities for areas such as education, housing and roads. In Northern Ireland, central Government and public body functions which cover those areas are subject to policy appraisal and fair treatment guidelines, which ensure that issues of equality and equity are central to all spheres of governmental activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order establishes a commission for racial equality for Northern Ireland to help enforce the legislation. It will also promote equality of opportunity and good relations between people of different racial groups generally. The intention is to appoint a minimum of five commissioners, one of whom will be the chairperson. The commission will advise the Government on the working of the legislation and will also be a principal source of information and advice for the public. Individuals who feel that they have suffered racial discrimination can seek assistance from the commission to obtain redress through the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The introduction of race relations legislation in Northern Ireland serves to demonstrate the United Kingdom's commitment to human rights for all its citizens, and I commend the draft order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.34 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems strange that we have waited 21 years for such a short statement and that it has been incredibly difficult for the Government to introduce this legislation. The Minister's introductory statement lasted for about only three minutes. Race relations legislation comes of age this year in Great Britain because it is 21 years since the passing of the Race Relations Act 1976. To day, we are belatedly introducing such safeguarding legislation for Northern Ireland. A stock question asked by generations of Labour Front Benchers has been removed; we shall no longer be able to ask, "When will the Government introduce race relations for Northern Ireland?" because they have now done so after 21 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has done his homework because he always does, but has he inquired of his colleagues who were Northern Ireland Ministers in 1976 why they did not introduce similar measures at the time of the Race Relations Act 1976?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be a good question—if I could trace them. That was, however, a long time ago and, mercifully—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government owe the ethnic minorities of Northern Ireland an apology for neglecting their needs for so long. In no other part of the United Kingdom should the Government have been so conscious of the need for legislation to guarantee basic human rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A raft of measures has been passed or administratively delivered—I accept the Minister's remarks on this—concerning the need for fairness across the community. The Minister could, however, admit that ethnic minorities have been neglected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0562">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Viggers 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gosport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is conversant with the situation in Northern Ireland. Will he remind me—given my experience there—the extent of deprivation that the ethnic minorities suffer? What is the unemployment level among the Indian community, which, when I was in Northern Ireland, was nil?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would love to be able to give the hon. Gentleman an answer, but the Government have no information about the ethnic minorities in Northern Ireland because they do not collect any. The Government have not sought to inform themselves about the ethnic minorities—that is one of the major areas in which they have been remiss. When one asks them for information on the number of ethnic minorities in Northern Ireland, they can find none and must go to the university of Ulster, which seems to be the only body to have conducted a survey on the matter. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentlemen's question. If he can find another way for me to obtain such information, he should have a word with the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office, the right hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There could have been two justifications for a delay. One would have been that the Government had looked into the special circumstances in Northern Ireland and introduced significantly different legislation from that which already existed. With a couple of exceptions, however, the Government have directly copied the format of the present provision from 21-year old legislation. It is regrettable that they have failed to take the opportunity to make improvements based on the recommendations for change highlighted in the Commission for Racial Equality's second review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that scale of the presence of ethnic minorities was not the issue. People need protection and the legislation is, in any case, important for the education of the rest of the population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second justification for the delay would have been that the Government had learnt from other legislation and introduced a development of the Race Relations Act 1976, but they have not done that. It remains perfectly legal to this day to discriminate against ethnic minorities in Northern Ireland. That has led—as the Minister knows, but did not acknowledge—to criticism of the British Government by the United Nations committee for the elimination of racial discrimination. That committee expressed serious concern at the absence of comprehensive race relations legislation throughout the United Kingdom. I cannot understand why the Government volunteered to be criticised in that way by failing over 21 years, to take the simple step of holding today's legislative sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Londonderry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is complaining about the Government not taking steps to introduce legislation. He has not, however, described what forms of discrimination ethnic and racial minorities have suffered in Northern Ireland or given figures, although I hope that he will do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with that point, although I should remind the hon. Gentleman of my reply to the hon. Member for Gosport (Mr. Viggers), in which
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
I said that the Government had made no real attempt to collect information on the matter. I shall, however, refer to statistics that have been collected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even after the Government accepted the need for legislation, the leisurely pattern continued; it is now more than four years since the consultation document was produced—it was published in December 1992. The Government are still not equipped with the information about the ethnic minorities that they should have. They are clearly a small group, but it could be argued that a small minority is vulnerable to discrimination and the need for protection is great. It is not adequate to say that people are not entitled to protection because there are not enough Asians in a community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have not collected the most basic information. Do they plan to provide a demographic, social and economic profile of the ethnic minority groups in Northern Ireland? Will the 2001 Northern Ireland census contain a question on ethnic groups? As I have said, the most reliable information that I can trace comes from the university of Ulster, which estimated that there are between 3,000 and 5,000 Chinese, 1,000 Indians and—this is a curiously precise number—641 Pakistanis, as well as 1,366 travellers living in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not even know on how many occasions the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987 has been used in response to incitement to racial hatred. However, we know that in 1995—this answers the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross)—66 racial incidents were reported. They mainly consisted of verbal abuse, damage to property, assault and intimidation. The great fear, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman would acknowledge, is that many other such incidents may have gone unreported—a clear picture of the position in Northern Ireland may not yet have emerged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the intergovernmental conference of the European Union will the Government agree to the consideration of minority rights, which would involve combating discrimination on the grounds of race, religion, age and disability? That point is being pushed particularly by Sweden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Have the Government budgeted for the measure and at what level? It is now becoming apparent just what a savage Budget the Government are implementing this year. It would be—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am sorry, but that is true. The scale of education cuts emerging in Northern Ireland is such that even the Minister is surprised by the consequences of his actions. Have the Government—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir David Mitchell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-West Hampshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I complete this point?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would an incoming Government have to deal with when implementing the legislation this year and how much money is there in the Budget?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir David Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman spoke contemptuously about the Government's strict limits on expenditure. I believe that the Labour party proposes to make no change to those spending totals, in which case the derisory note in his speech is inappropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0563">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not meant to be derisory, but sad. We shall inherit a difficult situation. I would particularly like to know what budgeting the Government have carried out. A Government would usually make an allowance in the Budget for the cost implications of introducing legislation. It would be interesting to hear—the Minister did not refer to this—what allowance has been made in the Budget for the implementation of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On April 15 1996 the Minister of State told me that the Government intended to amend the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987 by inserting a provision that will create an offence of causing intentional harassment, alarm or distress and will make the existing offence of publishing or distributing written material intended or likely to stir up hatred an arrestable offence. Will that be achieved by the order, or do the Government intend to amend the 1987 order in the way that the Minister suggested last year? It is likely that we will have to amend that order anyway in the next few months as a consequence of the North report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the fact that the order covers travelling people, as we urged. Many people requested their inclusion because travelling people have been the victims of harassment. It will be valuable to make clear the State's duty with regard to the educational and health needs of the travelling community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister explained the order's structure very quickly. Will he explain article 42, which establishes the commission for racial equality for Northern Ireland? It provides that there should be
	<br><blockquote><p>"at least 5 but not more than 7"</p></blockquote>
commissioners. Bearing in mind the small number of people from ethnic minorities in Northern Ireland, which the Minister noted, that provision seems to have been used without too much thought—I could be wrong—as to whether the structure is suitable for a Northern Ireland commission for racial equality. Did the Minister give any thought to having an ombudsman instead of the strange—for the small numbers of people involved—structure of not fewer than five and not more than seven commissioners? Are they to be paid, and if so, will that be on a full-time or part-time basis? Will there be a chief executive? What structure suits the establishment of such a commission? I have already referred to the organisation's budget, but given that we are talking about a population of between 10,000 and 15,000 people, why has that particular number of commissioners been chosen? It is similar to the size of the Scottish set up, but ethnic minority numbers are much larger there. Why has that particular model been chosen?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How does the Minister respond to criticism from the Community Relations Council and others, such as the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights, about the incoherent nature of the development of equity work in Northern Ireland? The Community Relations Council believes that there is a need for an overall review of the developing area of equity and rights work and that all aspects of legislation, monitoring and promotion need to be addressed. For example, Northern Ireland has the Community Relations Council, the Fair Employment Commission, the policy and fair treatment provision, the Central Community Relations Unit, and the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights; and there may
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
be more bodies to come. The Community Relations Council pointed out in 1993 that further bodies would emerge in the future, such as those dealing with disability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Canadian Human Rights Commission protects against discrimination on any of 10 grounds. Surely it cannot be right that we continue to develop policies in those areas— via legislation and institutions—in such an ad hoc and piecemeal way. The CRC says that the coming decade could see the development of up to 10 separate enforcement agencies in different areas of equity work. As an illustration of the variation in such bodies, the Government's own Standing Advisory Committee on Human Rights points out that under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, the Northern Ireland Council on Disability is an advisory rather than an enforcement body, but it has the power to introduce a code of practice on goods, facilities and services; by contrast, the Commission for Racial Equality is an enforcement body on discrimination which prohibits the non-provision of goods, facilities and services on the grounds of race. But the CRE can issue codes of practice only on employment and housing. There seems to be variation across different areas of discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What thought have the Government given to the consolidation of legislation and to making sense of what, for good reasons, has developed over the years, but now needs tidying up? I can imagine the exasperation of employers over the existence of different legislation and requirements coming from different bodies. We need to address the development of a constant and equal framework for legislation among the areas of inequality. The Labour party has a commitment to incorporating the European convention on human rights into domestic legislation, and that would seem to be the appropriate time to consider the present ad hoc set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a couple of specific issues arising from the articles in the order. Section 42 of the Race Relations Act 1976 contains a similar provision to article 41 of the order, involving national security. It relates to exemptions from the implications of the enforcement of the legislation. Under the 1976 Act that provision does not apply in the case of national security for Great Britain. There is an addition to that provision in this order. The order will not apply when issues of public safety or public order are also involved. The exemptions for Northern Ireland are extended. Why are the Government adding exemptions for public safety or public order for Northern Ireland? Will the Minister explain the logic? How often has section 42, giving an exemption to the order in the case of national security, been used in Great Britain? There is a worry that the exemption might get us into trouble again and bring us to the attention of the European Court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 67 is a good illustration of the dangers of simply copying the 1976 legislation and not giving it a sufficient twist to fit the circumstances in Northern Ireland. The Minister referred in his introductory remarks to the duty on local authorities. The provision lays on district councils the positive duty to make arrangements to ensure that what they do is geared to eliminating racial discrimination. It requires positive action rather than simply avoiding discrimination. The councils have to promote racial equality, not simply avoid discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the 1976 legislation, that is a positive duty given to local authorities. In Great Britain, the duties of local authorities are much wider than in Northern Ireland. Areas
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0564">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
such as social services, planning, housing and education are not dealt with by local authorities in Northern Ireland. Furthermore, central Government functions, such as health and social security, are not covered by the duty to promote positively rather than simply to avoid negative behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his introduction, the Minister said that this would be covered by the policy appraisal and fair treatment guidelines. However, I wonder whether PAFT is as all-embracing in terms of promoting equality and good relationships rather than simply ensuring that policies are not discriminatory. I question whether the Minister has given an adequate answer.

The smaller the group to which one belongs, the more vulnerable one is. [

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I am sure that he and the hon. Member for East Londonderry will be able to continue the discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In summary, the Opposition welcome this step forward in race relations provision, but we deplore the fact that it has taken the Government 21 years to implement the legislation in Northern Ireland. They do not seem to have taken the opportunity to learn from the experience in Great Britain. As I described in relation to the number of style of commissioners, the provisions appear to have been lifted from existing legislation without too much evidence of thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An enduring worry about Northern Ireland legislation is the frequency with which Committees such as this are asked to respond to a draft order. There should be a better tradition. Instead of simply producing a draft order, the Government should produce a policy paper surveying the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
problem. They should find out how many people belonging to ethnic minorities there are in the population and what problems they face, then they should say what they propose to do about the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present procedure is not satisfactory. A Government trying to think and learn should not simply lift 21-year-old legislation. That will lead to the sort of problems that I described in relation to article 67, where the Government have not taken into account the need for a different approach because of the lesser role of local government in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister say whether the Government have any plans on the stocks for an examination of anti-discrimination and human rights legislation in Northern Ireland? Has any serious work been done on co-ordinating and consolidating such legislation?

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the opening speeches with considerable interest and I must apologise, Mr. O'Hara, for the absence of my right hon. Friend the Member for Strangford (Mr. Taylor), who cannot be present today. I am sure that he would have much to say about this matter, but all hon. Members may speak in Committees such as this, even though they may not be eligible to vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) spoke about a delay of 21 years. I do not understand how the hon. Gentleman could have missed speaking to Lord Mason, who is often to be seen in the House of Commons. This matter is of great interest to him, and I am sure that he could have explained why he did not find time to introduce legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie also told the Committee that he was unhappy with using a draft order to implement the measures. That is exactly what we have always said—it is not a good way to introduce legislation. The hon. Gentleman rightly drew attention to the disadvantages of that approach. The best way to implement the legislation would have been by a Bill: we could then have explored the issues in detail by way of amendment. General principles could have been debated on Second Reading and we could have proceeded with the details in Committee. It would have been much better to have dealt with the issues that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was struck by the Minister's opening remarks. As so often in these matters, the terms "racial" and "ethnic" seem to be interchangeable. The Minister went on to refer to two communities in Northern Ireland. The order is riddled with a lack of precision over what is ethnic and what is racial. We seem to have no clear idea as to what is meant by those terms in the Northern Ireland context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the documents refers to a sum of £450,000. It is an estimate and I assume that that is a minimum amount set aside for the coming year to deal with problems that may flow from the factory of grievances that we are creating today. We already have a number of these bodies and all they ever seem to do is breed and spawn others for the next Parliament. It is about time that we started to simplify the way in which we deal with the problems rehearsed by the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0565">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
I was struck by article 22, which seems to have escaped everybody's attention. It prohibits discrimination on the letting or sale of property. The language is rather obscure: one would need to be a lawyer to investigate it thoroughly. I can well understand why we want to prevent discrimination in the letting of accommodation—certainly in the public sector. The same rules apply over here in the private sector. However, are we now saying that someone who is selling property should end up before a tribunal for having discriminated against an individual on the basis of race or religion? Why? Should the seller not be free to sell his property for whatever price he likes to whomever he likes? Is it not an attack on a basic human right? Have we got to the stage in this country where people are told to do as the community demands, regardless of their own wishes? [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] That is a horrible intrusion into the human rights of individuals. Should they be told to whom they may buy or sell?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should that happen to an individual in a shop? A supermarket may have a loss leader—10 tonnes of beans at 5p a tin. If someone tried to buy those beans to sell in his shop, the supermarket would be reluctant to sell them. If we are to adopt a certain approach, it will have to apply across the board. The approach has endless ramifications, which some members of the Committee who have been saying yes from a sedentary position should start to reflect upon. Frankly, everyone has freedoms; the freedom to dispose of property to any individual is a basic human freedom and owners of property should be allowed to enjoy it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come to the question of the unemployment of ethnic minorities—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Piara S. Khabra 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Southall)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that if the intention of the person who is disposing of property has racial implications, his individual freedom amounts to pure exploitation? It amounts to discrimination against another person on the basis of colour, religion or ethnic background.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not see why an individual should not discriminate over that if he wants to. Some communities may wish to maintain their position in an area. The hon. Gentleman should consider America, where small groups such as the Mennonites never sell property outside their own groupings and settlements, but will certainly buy from others. Are we seeing the creation of a one-way street? The disposal of property is a basic human right and I see no good reason to withdraw my remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had moved on to the question of unemployment and ethnic minorities in Northern Ireland. In his intervention, the hon. Member for Ealing, Southall (Mr. Khabra) used the word "racial" at the beginning of his remarks and "ethnic" at the end. He should sit down and think about what he means. We all know that it is possible to have a racial group that contains more than one ethnic group. I should have thought that within the general ethnic—that is to say, the recent immigrant—population in Northern Ireland, unemployment was pretty well non-existent. Such people tend to employ each other or to be small businessmen in their own right. The chances of them are being unemployed are practically nil. It would be interesting for the Minister and the Committee to have the figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie said that ethnic minorities had suffered 66 acts of discrimination or insult over a year. I wonder what the figure is for the rest of the community, given the present unsettled state of Northern Ireland. Members of ethnic minorities have been murdered by the IRA down the years. One or two other may have suffered robbery—not because they are members of an ethnic minority, but because the crooks in question thought that they were an easy touch. Sadly, we are all aware that that happens all the time throughout our community. I should have thought that, overall, the ethnic minority community in Northern Ireland—7,000 or 8,000 people—suffers less from criminal activity that the population at large. The Committee should bear that in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman support the legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To be perfectly honest, I think it is nonsense, like a great deal of the legislation relating to minorities that has passed through this House, usually, as the result of claims and allegations made outside the House over the past 25 years. For instance, the Jews have been, in the general scheme of things, a tiny part of the ethnic minority population in Northern Ireland. I do not know whether they have ever alleged massive, widespread discrimination other than the normal insult that any individual can suffer in the street. They have been a valued group in society and, sadly, they are slowly disappearing. There was a Jewish synagogue in Londonderry, where there might be one Jew remaining in the entire city. The Jews went to Israel at the end of the war so the former synagogue is now the headquarters of the Unionist party. We, at least, have no particular objection to the Jews.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As long as they are Protestant Jews.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well—I known the hon. Gentlemen's joke—I do not think that matters. The Jewish population in Northern Ireland was well-understood, highly respected and, as far as I know, had no problems with or from the general population. That applies to the one or two people of Indian and Pakistani extraction who live in my constituency. They are highly respected in the community; they give no trouble to anybody, live their own lives and do their own thing. They run their shops and businesses, although some of those in the second or third generation are moving away from that. Nobody bothers about them. They are accepted as part of the scenery and I am not aware that they suffer any discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same can be said of members of the Chinese community, who largely run takeaways and better-class restaurants. As far as I know, they have no problems with the local population; indeed, they provide employment for the communities in which they live. I wonder whether there is a real problem of discrimination, or whether it is more imagined than anything else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Khabra</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: An Irishman might want to buy property from an Englishman in London, but the Englishman might say, "I am not going to sell it to you because you are Irish." Does the hon. Gentleman agree that that is racial discrimination?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0566">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume from the reaction that I got earlier that in law it is, but I have not studied that aspect of racial discrimination. I do not care, however, whether the man is dealing with an Irishman or another Englishman he particularly dislikes; he could, presumably, refuse to sell to another Englishman. The incomer, the Irishman, would then have an advantage over the Englishman and would enjoy a freedom that he did not. That would be absolute nonsense, as the hon. Gentleman will realise if he thinks about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to consider another aspects of the provision. One group that causes immense concern in Northern Ireland is the travelling community, members of which are generally known by their long-standing name of Irish gipsies or tinkers, although that term carries connotations that they do not like. Such people cause communities serious problems, some of which my hon. Friend the Member for South Antrim (Mr. Forsythe) mentioned on 22 January in the Committee that considered the Road Traffic Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1996. He described the problems that such people cause communities by camping on roadsides and in lay-bys or as a result of their behaviour. They stop in the lay-bys that are created when a road is cut off and improved and conduct furniture sales or deal in scrap. There is no water supply and no toilets other than the fields, so hon. Members can well imagine the conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One group that exercised me camped on the west side of the Glenshane pass on the main Londonderry-Belfast road. It had previously been on the east side of the pass, and returned there after a day or two. When I passed yesterday, on my way to the House of Commons, council and Department of the Environment workmen were cleaning the site on the east of the pass of human excreta, rubbish and the foul mess that had been left behind. The Minister is well aware of that serious problem and the Northern Ireland Minister with responsibility for the environment, the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss), who is not present, is even more aware of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to find the right way to deal with any minority or group that causes such problems. We face the same difficulties that Great Britain has with new age travellers and it is time that we considered how to deal with them. The legal channel is not practical and public health powers are not strong enough. The measures contain nothing to deal with the problems of members of the resident majority population who may be harassed and suffer from the attentions of travelling groups, which can be up to a couple of hundred strong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In certain circumstances, council byelaws can be used to deal with the problem, but more needs to be done. We need strict time limits on camping by such ethnic groups—or racial groups as they are now to be properly described. One way to deal with the problem would be for the police to check vehicle tax. When that occurs, members of such groups usually depart in great haste. The introduction of an identity card would greatly help the detection not only of vehicle tax fraud, but of fraudulent claims for benefits by travellers. The same problem does not arise among the generality of ethnic minorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some cases, councils have provided camping sites. Whenever travelling people—they would call themselves the real travellers—turn up at such sites, they cause immense problems for other travellers there. On occasions, as soon as such groups of travellers have left,
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
the council has been obliged to replace the copper piping in the baths, and the showers and toilets, and clear up the rubbish. There is real difficulty in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister say how the Government are dealing with those settled racial groups of travellers? Are they still a separate ethnic racial group whenever they change their life style? For many generations they have lived nomadic lives: when they settle down, it is intended that they will be integrated slowly into the local community? Will they be given incentives to become settled people and live as the majority of the population lives, or will they be kept as a completely separate racial group?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are we trying to do in this country? Are we trying to create many different, self-contained communities within the nation? Or are we trying to achieve a more homogenous society, thus avoiding the difficulties apparent in places such as America, where race plays an even bigger part in social problems than it does in Great Britain or Northern Ireland generally?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth is that when crowds of travellers descend like vultures on an area, the harassment is suffered not by them but by the local people. The entire population of Glenshane—who will not vote for me in the general election, as the Minister knows—seemed to come to my door demanding that the travellers be removed as quickly as possible by whatever means were necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the reasons for treating the travelling people of Northern Ireland—the gipsies or Irish tinker population—as a racial group? Baroness Denton of Wakefield recently sent me a letter in which she stated that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Irish Travellers were a distinct ethnic group".</p></blockquote>
Article 5 of the order states that a "racial group" means a group of people defined in terms of their
	<br><blockquote><p>"colour, race, nationality or ethnic or national origins."</p></blockquote>
The order makes it clear that travellers are included because they have
	<br><blockquote><p>"historically, a nomadic way of life".</p></blockquote>
I must say that, if the travellers belong to a different racial group, it is not very evident. I think that they are different because of the mode of life that they have followed for generations. However, the order should make it clear whether the travellers are considered to belong to a different racial, rather than ethnic, group. Does the Minister believe that travellers are different racially, despite their Celtic, Roman Catholic origin, or that are they different ethnically because of their mode of life? Or are they both?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been mentioned, if that logic is taken further, it means that the Irish nationalist Roman Catholic population in Northern Ireland belong to a separate racial group, and that the Ulster Unionist, Protestant population—which considers itself British—is definitely a separate racial and ethnic group. That population has, as stated in article 5,
	<br><blockquote><p>"a shared history, culture and traditions".</p></blockquote>
Those people have racial origins in
	<br><blockquote><p>"two or more distinct racial groups",</p></blockquote>
in that they derive originally from the Celtic Irish, the Scots and the English. At one time, they even had a separate language, although they have all since drifted into using English.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0567">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Are we saying that every group has the right to propagate its culture and way of life, in the way that speakers of Irish have tried over the past 70 years to widen the gap between themselves and the British population of Northern Ireland? Would it not be better to try to make society more homogenous, or are we going to allow groups to become more separate? I hope that the Government have thought about the possible consequences the parades and demonstrations in Northern Ireland. There are different ethnic, cultural and racial groups to which we may wish to belong and the issue is a minefield. The Government have not thought the matter through—neither has the Labour party. I suspect that we shall hear an awful lot more about the order before we are finished.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman. He will appreciate that some strange pronunciations would come forth if an Englishman said "Maghera", "Lig-na-Paiste" or "Altnahullion", so I am sure that he will forgive me.'
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman listed various bodies. We have the Fair Employment Commission and the Equal Opportunities Commission, and we are to have a race relations commission—all for 1.5 million people. The ethnic minorities number 7,000 to 8,000 people, of whom up to 1,500 are travelling people. The rest are settled in the community; some stay but briefly in Northern Ireland, but are generally respected. None of us has any problems with them and I suspect that they encounter remarkably little difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are far too many organisations. They all deal largely with employment, in one form or another. At maximum we need two bodies to try to establish some cohesion and reason: one should provide advice, the other should enforce. I suggest to the Minister that, if he still has his job after the general election, he should pursue that matter. If the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie is in the job, he should think seriously about the best way out of the present mess, to which he also drew attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is so complex—there are so many cross-references—that it is causing immense difficulties for the population of Northern Ireland, not least in business and in employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Therefore, perhaps my right hon. Friend the Minister will forgive me if some of my questions are amply dealt with on pages that I have not yet read.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, will my right hon. Friend confirm that English travellers, a number of whom travel to Northern Ireland, particularly in the summer, will be covered by the order, as are other travellers? Secondly, he said that there was no limit to the compensation that might be awarded following a breach of the regulations. Who decides that compensation and is he satisfied that having no limit will not result in irrational conclusions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, will a new order be required if, in the not-too-distant future, additional powers are given to elected district councils in Northern Ireland? Would that require filling part of the McCrory gap, with which my right hon. Friend is familier? Is the giving of extra powers to district councils covered by the order or is further legislation required? When my right hon. Friend has dealt with those three queries, I shall be satisfied with the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting and useful debate. I should like to respond first to my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir D. Mitchell). The only travellers protected under this legislation are the Irish travellers. I shall deal with them more fully when I respond to the hon. Member for East Londonderry, but they have been regarded as a separate ethnic group. Under Great Britain legislation, the only group of travellers so regarded are the Romany gipsies, which receive this protection. I am informed that if Romany gipsies went from England to Northern Ireland, they would be covered by the legislation, but new age travellers would not. The legislation has been framed to prevent new age travellers form taking advantage of it. As in the rest of the United Kingdom industrial tribunals will decide on the amount of compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions will apply to district councils, whatever powers they have. I said earlier this morning—as did the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie—that the provisions would operate differently at the moment; if the powers of local councils increase, the provisions will apply equally to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to respond to the hon. Member for East Londonderry, who made a long and impassioned speech. He is arguing mainly against legislation in general rather than the order in particular. In response to the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie, the hon. Member for East Londonderry said that the legislation was, I think, unnecessary—I am not sure of the exact terms he used. I can only tell him that he is addressing problems that go far wider than this order. I appeal to him as a Unionist—surely he would want the same provisions of fairness that apply in the United Kingdom to apply in Northern Ireland. He will be relieved to know that the order is intended to apply the same level of legislation to all parts of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised a number of specific questions. He referred to there being two parts of the community within Northern Ireland. The order has been carefully drafted to ensure that no confusion arises—particularly in article 5, which is intended to ensure that race relations legislation is not used when the proper avenue would be fair employment legislation. That is intended to avoid the two main Northern Ireland communities claiming ethnicity purely on the basis of belonging to one or other of the main religious traditions.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not going to get involved in a detailed argument about the ethnic origins of every Unionist I have met in Northern Ireland—or indeed of every nationalist. I am aware that the hon. Member for Foyle (Mr. Hume) is the grandson of a Scot who went across to Ireland from Scotland and was a member of a Protestant denomination. As we all know, the hon. Member for Foyle is a Catholic nationalist. Therefore, to assert that there is an ethnicity that can be defined throughout the Unionist and nationalist communities might be a dangerous minefield upon which to enter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to deal with the hon. Gentleman's questions in another way, by looking at why the Irish travellers have been included in the order. First, many of the responses to the proposals for a draft order urged that the legislation should make clear the status of Irish travellers as a separate ethnic group. It is interesting that in other parts of Europe gipsies are recognised as a group requiring special protection. As I have already said, in Great Britain, we recognise that Romany gipsies are a racial group. Although it is clear that Irish travellers are of Celtic Irish ancestry and are normally Catholic, they are treated as being separate by mainstream Irish Catholic society, and they also regard themselves as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Irish travellers were thought to demonstrate accepted characteristics of ethnicity such as biological self-perpetuation. I discovered a new word yesterday—they are endogamous, which means that they marry within their own society. They have a shared culture and language, to an extent, and they regard themselves as separate form settled society. The fact that they travel is obviously another element, but it is only one element. This refers to another part of the hon. Gentleman's speech. If they settle—and I am told that some 60 per cent. of Irish travellers are settled—while they might lose that element of travelling, they stili retain those other elements of separate ethnicity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The view was that those factors pointed to the ethnic distinctiveness of the traveller community. It was believed that the position was not sufficiently clear to guarantee that the courts and industrial tribunals would interpret discrimination against Irish travellers as racial discrimination for the purpose of future legislation. Therefore, it was decided that the race relations legislation should make clear the status of the Irish traveller community as a separate ethnic minority group. That decision was announced by the Secretary of State on 27 July 1995.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Race Relations Act 1976 does not list specific minority groups, English case law has accepted both Romany gipsies and Irish people—to answer another
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
question—as constituting racial groups. To date, it has not been necessary to distinguish between Irish travellers and the Irish generally in the legislation for Great Britain. It is a difficult area, but we have set out to address it in a way that we believe will allow for fairness and justice to prevail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman tell us whether it was hoped that Irish travellers in general would eventually be incorporated into Catholic society in Northern Ireland? Is there any indication as to how many of them were born in Northern Ireland and how many in the Republic? They tend to travel down and camp in the south in winter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is getting into the realms of speculation, which is also dangerous territory. I am saying that we have looked at that particular group in the light of their life styles and traditions as they are now. We believe that in those terms they constitute a racial group when it comes to the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's reservations about the measure. However, I am sure that, as a Unionist, he appreciates that it might be strange if, after 21 years, we were not looking at bringing the laws on these matters in line throughout the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Bruce 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I declare an interest before asking my question. I am adviser to the Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services. It seems, from these exchanges, that if a Catholic firm decided not to take on a Protestant, it would not fall foul of this measure. But if an employment agency sent a Northern Ireland citizen, of whatever religious background, to a Chinese-owned company, which then discriminated against that individual and employed a Chinese instead of a white person, it would fall foul of the measure. Will my right hon. Friend clarify the position, as it seems a little strange?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall check on this and write to my hon. Friend as necessary. My understanding is that he is correct. His first example—of a Catholic firm not employing a Protestant—is covered by the fair employment legislation, which was designed for that purpose and introduced before this measure. We all appreciate that the situation in Northern Ireland was such that that legislation took priority. For that reason, the Labour Government, as well as the Conservative Government, decided that that matter should be dealt with first and that they would come to race relations legislation when the time and need arose. Obviously, I want to ensure that I have given my hon. Friend the Member of South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) accurate information. I will check that and write to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I always learn something when the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie speaks. Today, I learnt, first, that the Labour party policy is to change the basis of legislating in Northern Ireland. We look forward to hearing his recommendations about what he will do in the unlikely event that the Labour party finds itself in Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we heard again, which is not unusual, that Labour will spend more. I am always fascinated that whenever we have a debate of this sort, we are left with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0569">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
the clear impression that, were there to be a Labour Government, more money would be spent in several areas. It is only when we leave this building and hear the right hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) telling us that taxation will be no higher and current levels of spending will be maintained that we hear the other side of new Labour's approach. Whenever I press the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie too hard on that point, he always mentions the magic words windfall tax. That is Labour's way out of all problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the hon. Gentleman's specific questions, a number of which were important. First, he implied that we had not consulted those whom we should have consulted to ensure that the legislation was correct. We consulted widely in 1992 for more than a year about the shape of the legislation and we have subsequently had extensive discussions with ethnic minorities about the draft legislation. It would be wrong to say that there has been no consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman went on to say that it was strange and almost irresponsible of the Government to rely on a university to provide statistics. The statistics on ethnic minorities which are prepared by the university of Ulster are paid for and commissioned by the Government. That is a perfectly legitimate use of Government resources to ensure that we have the information that we need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the census in 2001. There was no pressure in 1991 to include an ethnic question in the census. We are considering and discussing with ethnic groups as to whether there should be such a question in 2001. Obviously, we want to hear what they have to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will it be ethnic or racial or both?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the moment, we are considering the possibility of an ethnic question, and we are consulting on that. If the hon. Gentleman wants to propose that the question should be wider, I am sure that he will do so through the proper channels and that his proposal will be given due consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie also asked about the amendment to the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987. That is not part of this order; it is still under consideration by the Northern Ireland Office. He is correct in that we have said that changes will be made, but they are not contained in the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I was in touch with the Minister I got the impression, not that changes were under consideration by the Northern Ireland Office, but that an amendment was to be made to the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987 in connection with the North report on parades. I was seeking an undertaking from the Minister that that would be an appropriate time to make that amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will understand that at the moment we are considering the implications of the North report. Indeed, many parts of the report are out to consultation and it would be wrong to predict the outcome. My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State will want to announce the results of that
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
consideration in due course. That may be the vehicle through which this change can be made. The hon. Gentleman asked whether it was part of this order and I can assure him that it is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie asked about finance. The hon. Member for East Londonderry said that the explanatory document refers to £450,000. That is an estimate. It will be for the commission, when it is established, to determine and prioritise its budgetary requirements and then apply to the Department of Economic Development for financial support. In terms of planning, however, £450,000 per annum has been set aside for the next three years. In addition, other budgets will continue to assist ethnic minority projects. We are therefore making provision, but until the commission begins to operate and to assess its precise requirements, it is difficult to give a more precise figure. There is cover, however, and that is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie had a passing lash at the cuts in expenditure. It is important that members of the Committee appreciate why Northern Ireland faces hardship in its economic and public expenditure provision this year. The ending of the IRA ceasefire last year and the problems that emanated from that through the summer have required the Government to find £120 million over the next three years to meet the security consequences. That money has to come from the Northern Ireland block. None of us wants to see that—we would all rather see the money being spent on the sort of programmes to which the hon. Gentleman referred, but, in the words of Lord Healey, that is the elephant on the doorstep which we had better recognise, because otherwise we will tend to get trampled on. It is the reason why things will be hard this year in Northern Ireland. I hope that that lesson is not lost on those who are causing the extra expenditure when they see the effect that it has on their communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked several specific questions. With regard to article 67, the draft Race Relations (Northern Ireland) Order, in common with legislation in Great Britain, places a duty—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sense that the right hon. Gentleman is moving away from the structure of the proposed CRE in Northern Ireland. If he is going to deal with that later, I shall wait, but I am interested in why it will have not fewer than five and not more than seven commissioners, and why the Government have simply lifted the Great Britain model.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with that now, because the hon. Gentleman would obviously feel happier if I did and I always try to satisfy him. We will advertise for a chairman and it is planned that he or she will work for two days a week. There will be at least five and not more than seven commissioners, as the hon. Gentleman said, and they will be paid approximately £3,500 per annum. It is up to the commissioners to decide on staffing; they are likely to have three or four staff, including a chief executive. The hon. Gentleman will also see that under the legislation, the number of commissioners can be varied, a fact which will be taken into account as the commission develops.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Khabra</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What will be the racial balance in the appointment of commissioners?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0570">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter which will be carefully considered, as it is important. However, I cannot give the hon. Member for Ealing, Southall (Mr. Khabra) an answer at this stage, as a view has not yet been formalised. If it will help, I shall wrote to the hon. Gentleman about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie talked about the commission and all the other bodies, and wondered whether there was a need for consolidation. I think that the hon. Gentleman feels that we should proceed now. He repeatedly referred to the 21 years over which this Government have delayed, but for the first three and a half years it was a Labour Government who delayed. The reason they delayed was because they understood the situation in Northern Ireland—as do we—rather better than the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, we want to consider whether there is a case for consolidation, but it would be sensible for us to await the review of employment equality that the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights is currently undertaking. We want it to see whether there is a case for further consolidation. That can then be considered in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie asked about articles 67 and 41. Article 67, in common with the legislation in Great Britain, places a duty on local government to promote good race relations at a local level. The order also aims to emphasise that the establishment of the Commission for Racial Equality in Northern Ireland will not absolve local government from its responsibilities with regard to ethnic minority groups. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman accepts that. Placing such a duty on local government will ensure that all councils—not just those with large ethnic minorities in their areas—will take responsibility for promoting good race relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, the Northern Ireland legislation has been drafted to suit central and local government structures. Central Government functions in Northern Ireland are subject to the PAFT guidelines, which ensure that issues of quality and equity condition policy making and are central to all spheres of Government activity. Circumstances in Northern Ireland differ from those in the rest of the United Kingdom. The other is right to recognise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 41 relates to national security. Again, it reflects the special circumstances of Northern Ireland, where there are problems which, by and large, do not exist elsewhere in the United Kingdom. The wording of the article reflects that, but is not unusual: it is in line with other Northern Ireland legislation such as the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973, the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1976 and the Sex Discrimination (Northern Ireland) order of 1976. The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie will know that the latter two were passed by a Labour Government. Article 41 provides the necessary level of protection in the particular security circumstances of Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie for his welcome for the order. Both Labour and Conservative parties, when in Government, have taken a sensible approach to the matter, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is as pleased with the outcome as I am.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. This the first time that you have chaired a Committee of which I have been a member. I look forward to the experience. So far, you have made it clear that you want to let the debate flow and you have allowed hon. Members to make a number of points related to the order: I hope that you will allow me to do the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disappointed in what the one hon. Member from Northern Ireland, the hon. Member for East Londonderry, had to say. His remarks seemed neanderthal at first, but then I realised that he was expressing an imperial view of the development of communities. The hon. Gentleman asked whether the intention was to create a homogenous community: I have not heard such talk for 30 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the development of the new age travellers, the Government recently have moved away from encouraging the proper treatment of travellers in Great Britain, and their approach is now half-hearted. That is very sad, but the argument from the hon. Member for East Londonderry seemed to be that there should be a monocultural rather than multicultural approach in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is an honourable gentleman. I am sorry that he did not respond more strongly and make it clear that the Government have no intention of encouraging a monoculture or a homogenous community. He should recognise the joy and pleasure to be gained when people live in harmony in multicultural society. The culture of Northern Ireland would benefit if people could leave behind some of the baggage that history has forced on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ethnic profile of Northern Ireland was discussed at some length. The saddest comment came when people from an ethnic minority were praised for being quiet and not causing trouble. My hon. Friend the Member for Southall deserves commendation. He is a Member of Parliament because he spoke up and took a position. That is the point, and why people from different ethnic communities should be celebrated. They deserve protection from discrimination not so that they can be quiet but so that they can speak up and demand their rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order may be 21 years late, but I am glad that the Government have brought it in at the fag end of their life. I commend the Minister for that, but why is such an important measure only a statutory instrument? That has happened far too often. Perhaps the Government thought that they did not have time to take it through a proper legislative process, but that would have allowed serious debate on the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie: we must consolidate the approach to human rights in mainland Britain and in Northern Ireland—not just tag measures on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the order, which is at least being implemented, but that implementation is shoddy and an insult to the people of Northern Ireland. The measure is not a look to the next millennium, but a stitching-on as the current millennium is ending. It does not prepare Northern Ireland for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we will consider the matter seriously when we come to power and try to put it into the framework of legislation for Northern Ireland. I also hope that, following a thorough debate, hon. Members of all parties in Northern Ireland will support a human rights structure
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0571">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
that will allow people to develop their relations with each other. That might lead to some reconciliation on other, deeper matters which have riven the nation of Northern Ireland in two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Londonderry said that there could be all sorts of marches. He seemed to put that up as a spectre, or a threat. I watched the march in London of the Hindu community celebrating the opening of their mandir. It was not threatening, but a wonderful and joyous celebration and something from which Northern Ireland could learn. People respect marching in joy and pleasure, but not threats and aggression. There might be some celebration of the ethnic communities that could lead the way—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Gentleman and interrupt the flow of argument—there have been few occasions on which I have had to intervene, and I thank the Committee for that—but I draw his attention to article 5(3)(b), to which the Minister referred. It specifically excludes
	<br><blockquote><p>"religious belief or political opinion".</p></blockquote>
I was listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman and it appeared that he was beginning to stray down a wrong path. I ask him to bear that in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that direction, Mr. O'Hara.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the hon. Member for East Londonderry was making a point about the question of ethnicity and race. If the matter is mixed up with religious persuasion it becomes a difficulty, which is why we need a consolidation of our approach to human rights rather than a separate religious fair employment Act or a measure to deal with ethnic minorities. That is what Northern Ireland deserves and should have had over the past 21 years, since the passing of the Race Relations Act 1976, which deals with the British mainland, was passed. We might then have been further on with giving tools to those who want to create a society that does not focus on the great divides in Northern Ireland of historical and religious culture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had the pleasure of chairing the launch of the Labour group of the Ulster Unionist movement in Belfast in 1995. Many people there thought that past legislation, which was reactive, had heightened people's awareness of the divides. That is worrying. The order is preventive. A small part of it is aimed at giving local authorities a positive role. Only a line and a half of the legislation talks of promoting good race relations, which is too little. It is better positively to promote good relations and respect for people's ethnic backgrounds than to try to legislate to prevent aggression from breaking out between ethnic groupings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had the pleasure of chairing a session of the Northern Ireland youth parliament in 1995. There were some young people from different ethnic communities there—in very small numbers, I might add. The saddest thing was that most of the young people who came from different parts of the divide—as mentioned by the hon. Member for East Londonderry—had never spoken together, even though they may have come from the same town.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legislation, though welcome, is only welcome as a marker. It should be built on by a future Government in the context of consolidated human rights legislation.
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
I shall not try to negate the instrument, but the people of Northern Ireland are trying to take a broader view and seek ways out of the dilemma of history. They want a positive—not just a quiet—role. They want more than passing a law merely to prevent people from being discriminated against negatively; they want the positive elements to be promoted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say a few words about the traveller population. There is a debate over whether a travelling population can be an ethnic grouping. In particular, it has been debated whether travellers of Romany gipsies are a racial or endogamous group. I had thought that "endogamous" had been invented by the shadow Chancellor—but that is probably "endogenous". What is regarded as inter-breeding and self-perpetuating for economic policy might be just the same for racial and ethnic reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Discrimination is still exhibited on the continent against Romany gipsies. It reminds me of the comments made by the hon. Member for East Londonderry about the travelling Irish population. The travelling population on the mainland of Britain may well still be regarded with prejudice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the leader of a council, I used to speak to travellers and sought to plan and provide for them. Sites were available to accommodate their life style. There were permanent sites, but, although they were permanently provided, they were not permanently full of travellers. Their life style became accepted and their trades were respected. I am told that Perth travellers could tell people the price of any metal from a scrap dealer in Scotland, particularly on a Friday: such is their knowledge of markets. They will travel a long distance to carry out their trade, but return to regular sites, following a regular pattern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are putting this provision in the legislation, but they will have a short life and a new Labour Government will soon be in power. The Labour Government will take a more positive view and try to provide facilities for travellers. The legislation will not then be merely a statement of principle but will be acted on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I inform the hon. Gentleman that exactly the same knowledge of the value of metal is possessed by the so-called travelling community in Northern Ireland. A friend of mine works in engineering, doing up ships' propellers, which are often made of valuable metals such as bronze and so forth. He told me that one day all those metals were gone and they all turned up later in Cork.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I saw nothing in the legislation to suggest that criminals were an ethnic group, although they, too, may have an endogamous behaviour pattern and intermarry and perpetuate themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the hon. Gentleman's comment was helpful. The present measure should have been considered under a previous Government soon after, if not at the same time as, legislation for the rest of the United Kingdom. By
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0572">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
setting similar legislation in a Northern Ireland context, we shall make people face up to the prejudices that have been described today. If the measure achieves that and starts a real debate, we may make progress. The measure should, therefore, be welcomed. If, however, the statements made by the only hon. Member from Northern Ireland present today reflect the community's views about ethnic minorities and particularly the travelling
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
community, we shall have a long way to go before we achieve a just society with human rights for all in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
