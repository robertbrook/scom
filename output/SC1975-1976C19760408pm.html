	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. E. S. Bishop)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned this morning, the Committee was considering the points made by the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton). I told him, with regard to his anxieties about the restrictive practices legislation, that a very wide measure of exemption for agricultural associations had been provided in the legislation since 1962, and that the Agricultural and Forestry Associations Act of that year exempted from registration the agreements made by formally constituted co-operatives and their members in connection with the marketing of members' produce and the supply of requisites to those members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that over a period of time this matter has engaged the attention of the industry, the NFU and many others engaged in the production of food. The Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1968 widened the classes of co-operativcs and agreements which could benefit under the 1962 Act. As recently as 1974, extensive consultations were carried out with the NFU and other interested organisations on the way in which the 1972 arrangements should be expanded and brought up to date. A substantial measure of agreement was reached and, as I mentioned this morning, the outcome was the Agricultural and Forestry Associations Order 1974 which came into force on 1st March 1975, only just over a year ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1190</span>
The position has been reviewed, action has been taken and changes have been made. The most important change which the order made was to extend exemption from the restrictive trade practices legislation to arrangements under which a number of co-operatives consisting of individual producers agreed to sell their members' produce through a second-tier co-operative, which is referred to as a federal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This new order widens still further the range of agreements to which exemption is given and it goes as far as possible to assist the legitimate activities of agricultural co-operatives while preserving a balance between their needs and the interests of consumers. I would remind the Committee of some of the points I made in this connection this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the provisions of the Agricultural and Forestry Associations Order 1974 are somewhat complex, and I recognise that they need to be tested in the light of experience. I can give the hon. Member for Macclesfield the assurance that if any substantial difficulties are reported these will be fully considered in consultation with the interests concerned. If any changes in the existing legislation are considered to be desirable, they will be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the proposed EEC directive on producer groups could, when it appears, involve a much more radical reappraisal of the relevant legislation affecting agriculture associations, and it would seem good sense to wait for this. I think I can give an assurance that the matter is under review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would also emphasise that when changes of this sort are proposed a great deal of investigation and consultation is necessary on the restrictive practices front, with the Office of Fair Trading, with other Ministries, with the NFU and with a number of other organisations. Although I appreciate the hope of the hon. Member for Macclesfield and his hon. Friends that something might be done on this occasion, I think he will agree that this could bring about a radical change in the operation of agriculture. He will be aware of the very good work done by the Central Council for Agricultural and Horticultural Co-operation, which is making an increasing contribution to agricultural co-operation, and in the case of co-operatives there are special exemptions from restrictive practices legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0653">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1191</span>
But I agree with the hon. Member that some changes might be considered, though I feel that the Bill is not the vehicle for them. I think it would be better to allow the working out of the changes that have been made in the last year or so, by the orders to which I have referred to show us what other changes are necessary. I am sure the Government will be very sensitive about taking action to deal with some of the anomalies to which the hon. Gentleman has referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am absolutely astonished to hear the Minister of State trying to argue against this new clause by saying that this Bill is not the vehicle for this type of change. When I see what the Government have done over this Bill to use it as a vehicle for everything they could think of, and when I hear the Minister at this stage having the nerve to say that the Bill is not the vehicle for these types of amendment, I just give up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me clarify the position. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman was listening. I was saying that the Bill is not the vehicle for this new clause. As the hon. Member knows a great deal of consultation would have to take place. Obviously we could not make amending legislation in the Bill unless consultation had taken place. I know that he is referring to the family succession clauses, which were introduced after the Committee had suspended its operations for a few sittings while further consultations took place. What I am saying is that the consultation which would be necessary to do justice to the case that the hon. Member has put forward would make it impossible to bring in the provision on this occasion. However, I have given an undertaking that after the operation of last year's order has been assessed, and with the changes that are possibly afoot in the EEC, there will be an opportunity for review and action as necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We on this side of the Committee are always grateful for the Minister's sympathy, but is that enough? Can the Committee really accept his assurance that he is keeping the matter under review? Is that adequate? I understand from the National Farmers' Union and other bodies that they have
	<span class='label label-info column'>1192</span>
discussed various aspects of this highly complicated subject with the Minister's Department over several years. It is not just since 1974 or 1975. This matter has been interesting bodies involved in farming, and the Ministry itself, over many years. Numerous papers have been presented to the Ministry setting out in detail the unwarranted difficulties, which I am sure the Minister appreciates, that are caused to the agriculture industry by the restrictive practices legislation, and these papers have gone further in that they have suggested solutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far, however, apart from a very small measure of help for co-operatives in the 1974 Agricultural and Forestry Associations Order, there has been no action. Bearing in mind the pressure and the representations which have been made over so many years, is that really good enough? The National Farmers' Union has the impression of being met by solid stonewalling on the part of the Ministry whenever the issues have been discussed. This would not lead me to believe that the assurance, which I am sure the Minister is giving in good faith, means very much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A highly technical matter of this complexity requires all concerned to combine in making an imaginative and constructive approach if a satisfactory solution is to be found. We cannot keep putting off the finding of a satisfactory solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely one possible answer to some of the problems is provided by this clause which I hope will be acceptable to the Committee. t would enable the farmers' unions and the co-operative organisations to do much more in giving advice and guidance to their members—surely this can only be to the benefit of farmers and the farming industry—and to assist them in carrying out their businesses. Again, surely this can only be to the advantage of agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Small businesses cannot employ specialist advisers on a full-time basis. They may be able to engage the services of consultants and professional advisers, but to obtain all the necessary services in this way would be much more expensive than it is for the larger business which employs experts on a full-time salaried basis. I need not emphasise that point. I am sure that it is already understood by every hon. Member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, not all the required ser-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0654">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1193</span>
vices are available to the small business from independent sources. Even when they are, they may not be sufficiently specialised. In agriculture, such services can be provided by the National Farmers' Union and the co-operative organisations, which can employ specialist advisers on a more economical basis and people who will be specially skilled in relating their expertise to the industry. t is difficult to make the best use of the services of such advisers, except by using methods which technically are caught up by the Restrictive Trade Practices Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause, which I commend most strongly to the Committee, would remedy this problem. It would also deal with the legal hindrances placed in the path of the farmers' unions when they wish to give a lead to the industry, particularly at times of crisis. Again I remind the Committee that this country is facing a crisis. With the pound dropping through the floor, it is vital that we produce more of the food that we require. I believe that the farmers' unions and the farming industry can do this, if some of these restrictions are unloaded from their shoulders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is broadly agreed among all political parties—I am delighted that the Liberal Member is with us this afternoon; he indicated to me that he has considerable support for the new clause—that it is necessary to control agricultural output and to regulate the industry generally in the interests both of the national economy and of the consumer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Body</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed, and if my hon. Friend wishes to intervene I should be happy for him to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the hon. Member and hon. Lady opposite that they were signatories in public to an early day motion on the Order Paper of the House which was signed by nearly 200 members of all parties, and its objective is precisely the content of the new clause which we are now debating. The clause would enable farmers' unions to play a bigger part in the process which I have just described, for example, by encouraging the increased production of specific commodities in order to avoid shortage and by helping to maintain confidence in times of crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position of agricultural co-operatives tinder the restrictive trade practices legis-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1194</span>
lation is, as the Minister has rightly said, extremely complicated. The basic concept of an agricultural co-operative is of a body which trades in its members' agricultural produce or which assists their production by supplying them with the goods and materials needed for their farms. The legislation, however, treats them in quite a different way, namely, as trade associations, the existence of which is suspect. This means in effect, that many ordinary, every-day trading activities which contain no legal complications for other businesses can lead a co-operative body into a morass of legal technicalities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause would not be a complete solution to this situation, but it would remove some of the complications and thus enable agricultural co-operatives to carry out their ordinary functions without being quite so concerned about whether their activities were lawful. If farmers are to be encouraged to trade with and through co-operatives, which has been the policy of successive Governments for many years, the co-operatives must be treated as trading bodies rather than as trade associations for the purposes of the restrictive practices legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless the Minister is prepared to go further than the assurance—I am sure it was sincere, although I do not think there is much behind it—that he has given, I must ask the hon. Lady and hon. Member opposite to honour their signatures to the early day motion which they signed in knowledge of the full facts of the situation and in the knowledge that this matter had been discussed between the NFU and farmers' organisations and the Ministry over a number of years. I ask them to vote with us to insert the new clause in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. I have been a loyal and silent member of this Committee so far, so, despite the fact that the Whip is looking at me, I intend to say a word or two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only did I sign the motion, but, if I remember rightly, it was I who put down the motion. Therefore, I have a certain interest. I do not intend to support the clause. There is something to be said for the argument that to bring it in as a back-bench amendment at this point and in this Bill is not the appropriate way to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0655">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1195</span>
do it, especially as I am convinced by Government action that it can often be counter-productive to the Government in Committee, because they have other means of reversing that decision at a later stage and it tends to make them even more solidified in a policy when they are given the public humiliation of a defeat. Therefore, it would be counter-productive to try to achieve this on Committee. This is not an excuse. It is bitter experience. I have the experience of the mule with little pride of ancestry and no hope of posterity. So I say it from a perfectly safe position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I do not want the Minister or the Ministry to believe that this is a ploy offered, as always, by the Opposition at this stage of the game. There is a great deal of merit in the principles enunciated in the clause, although I do not think that we should pass the clause in its present form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand that the Minister is paying attention to the arguments, he should remember that there arc also people on this side of the House who have not always taken a reactionary view on agriculture and who are stressing the same points. But there is a difference, particularly between agricultural production, on the one hand, and the role of the cooperatives, on the other. It is a simple proposition that farmers often face being barred from getting the kind of advice and marketing policy which would have been useful to farming production and marketing at a particular point in time, because they were being restricted under the existing restrictive trade practices legislation. Above all, this applies to the co-operatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that there is a big difference between an agricultural co-operative and normal trade associations. The difficulty is that the agricultural co-operative, which is basically a producing body—a trading body—is nevertheless treated for the purposes of the Act as if it were a trading association and subject to these restritions. I am thinking of one massive co-operative which does a major job on behalf of 300 producers, who work on a contractual basis and who find themselves restricted both in advice and in other ways because of the present practices of the legislation. It should be taken not only into long-term consideration but into immediate consideration,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1196</span>
because the only way forward in agriculture is to introduce an element of planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to see an extension of contracting in farming and an extension of producer co-operatives and co-operative marketing in farming. The existing legislation inhibits this, and we have not got a great deal of time to sort it out. The Ministers know my views on how I think agriculture should be planned in future, and if we do not move speedily on this we may find the major problem facing Britain of food procurement being made more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason arises from the position we face in the EEC. With respect even to my hon. Friend the Whip, the problems created by the EEC are not of my making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Ellis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nor mine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nor of his making. It is humbug on the part of the party opposite to call this in aid on every possible occasion. They are now the greatest anti-marketeers in the business, so I pay very little attention to what they have to say on this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, the presence of the EEC and the legislation prevailing in Europe means that we must look at the whole co-operative position far more generously and open-mindedly than in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put down the motion which was signed by 200 Members; I did not know that so many Conservatives supported me on agriculture; they usually refer to me as the hon. Marxist for Renfrewshire, West, or as an agricultural anarchist. Two hundred supported me, including, no doubt, a number of Conservatives. Whether they did so for ulterior motives, our motion was right. We had to bring this to the attention of the Government. We were right in saying to the Government that the treasure must be brought up from the ship rapidly. I do not support the clause and hope having made the point, it will be withdrawn. But I think the Government must take it on board with rather more urgency than I detected in the tones of the Minister of State in his reply just now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member talks about a motion which went down in his name last year. I think he would not take it amiss if I said to him that that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0656">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1197</span>
motion was drafted by the National Farmers' Union. Neither will he take it amiss if I tell him that this new clause was drafted by exactly the same people who drafted his motion. It was because our names happened to be on the new clause that he did not get his down first, and I remind him that at the last general election it was part of the Conservative Party's manifesto that we would look into all these matters again if we were successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1 do not think the hon. Gentleman can begin to say that we are latching onto this in the hope of stealing a quick political march over the Government or over hon. Members opposite. For a long time it has been part of my party's policy to think again about these matters. As both the motion and the new clause were drafted by exactly the same people, I cannot understand why he cannot be consistent and why he cannot support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has always been a long-lasting part of the Conservative Party's policy to think again about these matters. The trouble is that it never does anything about them in the lobbies. Hon. Members opposite are always thinking again about these matters, especially when they are approaching an election. It is exactly what they said on this occasion. They did nothing about it when they had the opportunity. On the question whether I will not take this or that amiss, the hon. Gentleman has scored two misses. I drafted the motion; the NFU drafted the clause. I would reject the clause—that is a short miss. I accept the motion, which is mine. Mine is a perfectly logical and tenable position. I take 50 per cent of it amiss regretfully. I will repeat what I said. I want the Government to take this on board with a great deal more urgency than they have done and sort out particularly the co-operative aspect so that we can make some progress, because I believe it is vital to forward the agricultural plan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not want to intervene, but I have been goaded into doing so by some of the quite outrageous remarks that I have heard from the Benches opposite. In doing so, I ought to declare an interest. I have for some years been an active member of a farming co-operative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1198</span>
I am rather anxious about this clause. Clearly, there is a case for reviewing the law as it now stands, but the clause goes much too far. I hope that, rather than be called upon to vote one way or the other now, we have further time in which to consider it quietly and in some depth and not be wholly persuaded by remarks today. I do not know whether they came entirely from my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) or whether he was inspired by others, as I suspect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always inspiring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend inspires me? The phrases that I heard—it must have struck him—did not come naturally from the mouth of my hon. Friend. I am rather worried about some of these arguments, and I do not think we should press the matter to a vote. I am all in favour of reviewing it, but perhaps it could be done at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There seems to be an unholy alliance here. In the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), it may not be amiss if someone called "Bishop intervenes". There has been a plea to exempt the NFU. t would be difficult to justify singling out the NFU for special exemption under the restrictive practices legislation. Trade associations generally are concerned to promote the interests of their members, and in some cases these interests do not coincide with those of the consumer or the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the interests of the consumer, therefore, control has to be exercised over restrictive agreements or recommendations in agricultural matters. The hon. Member alleged that no important changes had taken place as a result of the 1974 order to which he and I made reference. As I told the Committee earlier, the most important change which the order made was to extend exemption from the restrictive practices legislation to arrangements under which a number of co-operatives consisting of individual producers agreed to sell their members' produce through a second-tier co-operative or, as it is referred to in the order, a "federal".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, the new order widens still further the range of agreements that are given exemption. Indeed, it goes as far as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0657">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1199</span>
possible to assist the legitimate activities of the agricultural co-operatives while preserving a proper balance between their needs and the interests of the consumers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have done a service by drawing attention to the need for review of this legislation. The Government certainly have it very much in mind. I have told the Committee that we want to see the working out of the 1974 order, and the changes that are likely to arise from the EEC. It would be appropriate, in this changing situation, to take all these factors into account before making the necessary changes. I hope that, with that assurance the hon. Gentleman will recognise my acknowledgment of the service that he and others have performed in drawing our attention to this matter and that he will find it possible to withdraw the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister's remarks mean that his Ministry has every intention of bringing in the necessary legislation very soon to amend the present situation, I, as a member of the Opposition, and ever sensitive to the prevailing trends—not only that promoted by the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) but the minor reservations expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body)—I believe that the Minister is saying that the Government intend to act quickly.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This simply seeks to breathe new life into the landlord-tenant system and to get more let land in the country. We have said so often in the Committee that the effects of the Bill and the consequent effects of taxation will severely reduce the number of farms coming on the market to let. This is an attempt to produce, for new lettings and new contracts, where everyone is going into it with their eyes open, a new form of tenancy which will encourage owners to let their land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under subsection 1(
	<i>b</i>), this will not commence until 29th September 1976, which gets over any retrospective effects. It is supported by a number of farming bodies. I mention in particular the Young Farmers' Clubs, which feel strongly on this matter. It deserves careful consideration in the light of what has been said, during these lengthy proceedings, about the landlord-tenant system. The Committee will note that 25 years has been selected. I suppose somebody will hark back to the Minister's remark earlier that the average length of a tenancy was 30 to 40 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very difficult to find any evidence. Certainly, as far as I can see, no studies have been done by the Department as to the average length of a tenancy. It appears that the 30 to 40 years' calculation comes from the ADAS surveys. The last one was dated May 1975. This showed that 2.3 per cent of farms within the survey had new tenants. Therefore, one can only conclude that the Minister's advisers made a simple arithmetical conclusion and said, using a little common sense and a little mathematics, that the average length of a tenancy was 30 to 40 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps a more careful and productive approach is to consider, first, that a tenancy must have ended when a tenancy holding disappears from the ADAS returns produced in June each year, and secondly, when a new tenancy is granted. Over the period 1970 to 1973, on average the number of tenancy holdings was declining by 2.7 per annum. In addition,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0658">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1201</span>
the proportion of new tenancies within the ADAS rent survey averaged 2.2 per cent per annum. I am never very good at mathematics myself, but I am assured that, combined, these two figures give a total of 4.9 per cent, which implies that the average length of a tenancy is much less than 30 to 40 years—somewhere, one might say, between 20 and 22 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This does not invalidate all we have been saying about the overall effect of the Bill on removing land from the owners' control because that is only an average, but it would seem to imply that the figure we have selected covers much more the average life of a tenancy than perhaps was indicated by the Minister's previous figures. It would also, therefore, imply that the grant of this sort of tenancy would not inhibit capital investment or good farming, and both parties would be going into it with their eyes open. Therefore, it stands a chance of bringing more land on to the market, which is so urgently needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support this. I have indicated at previous sittings that the Bill was not the place to introduce these clauses because we had hoped the Agricultural Holdings Act would have been overhauled, and we should have a breath of fresh air in the Act which would enable new types of contracts between an owner and the man who was to farm the land, such as is the case abroad. But since they have been introduced, I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) has mentioned this matter, which is one way in which we could entice the landlord to put more land on the market to let.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am convinced that many landlords and many tenants would like to do this. As I have already said, many people would like to enter into a contract of tenancy which they know would end at a particular time. They could arrange their affairs so that they could have a pension at the end of 25 years, they would have educated their children, and that was what they wanted. I believe that if a landlord was enabled to do this, it would entice more land on to the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have heard some horrifying figures, in the past few weeks, since this matter has been mentioned, of rents which have been given or offered for land. I believe
	<span class='label label-info column'>1202</span>
very largely because people realise that the supply of land will be drying up completely and that they will have the opportunity to pass it on to their children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe there are other ways in which we could do this, but I very much support my hon. Friend, who proposes a practical method. If a landlord perhaps wants to give up some land which he has been farming because he is without a son, and feels that he is not capable of going on farming, in a fresh letting where there is no inheritance of a previous tenancy why should he not let to a good man for a fixed period of time? This would enable people to farm the land and to do what they want to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support everything that has just been said. Obviously, one is in danger of repeating oneself, and I will try not to do so. The fact is that we shall cause very real difficulties for young men to get into farming from now on. We have heard put very forcibly by the hon. Member for Dudley, West (Dr. Phipps) that what he was concerned with was justice and cases of hardship. There could be no hardship, no injustice caused if the amendment were allowed and the new clause inserted. A new tenant coming into agriculture would, with his eyes wide open, know what he was committing himself to, and would he only too pleased to accept the kind of tenancy that the clause envisages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Twenty-five years seems to be a reasonable period. There could be no possible cause for any ill feeling between landlord and tenant if such an agreement was entered into. Above all, it would avoid the necessity upon which many landowners are embarking, of finding devices to get round these clauses. They will be got round—there is no doubt about that. One can get round them by forming farming partnerships or forming companies with the landowner having 51 per cent of the shares or 51 per cent interest in the partnership. That will be a threat hanging all the time over the tenant who is left with 49 per cent—knowing that the landowner will be able to dissolve the partnership or wind up the company at a very short period of notice. This is how it will be used; there can be no doubt about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to permit the new clause to be inserted, it would avoid the necessity for landowners, and particularly the large institutional landowners—I do not want
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0659">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1203</span>
to use the word "ruthless", but they will certainly be the most determined to get their money's worth out of their land—to embark upon these devices to get round the clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I hope the Minister will consider this with some sympathy, not from the point of view of the landowners, but from the point of view of existing tenants and those who would like to become tenants. These are the ones who would gain by a clause such as this. The landowner himself would stand to gain nothing by the new clause, but entrants into agriculture would. It is for their sake that I hope the Minister will give consideration to it. If he cannot support it now, perhaps he can reflect on some of the things that we have said, on the way in which these clauses will be got round, and on the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins), who has spoken of the very sharp increase of rents for land that has now been let—let after the announcement by the Government that they were intro-during this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rents have roared up in the few cases where land has been let. The figures are quite startling. I hope that, between now and Report, the Minister will use his intelligence service, through ADAS and elsewhere, to find out how much rents are now going up. He will find that very sharp increases are now being negotiated.—If I say 100 per cent increases, I do not think I am exaggerating. I will not quote the example because I have not ascertained the truth of it, although it comes from a reliable source, but I have heard of an instance of rent being agreed which is double what it would have been a few months ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a situation is quite appalling for youngsters trying to get into farming, or for any existing tenant trying to increase his holding by taking on further land which may be adjoining and could be conveniently added to the existing farm. I hope, therefore, if he cannot agree now, that the Minister will consider these two points, because I believe they are of great importance to the future of agriculture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have given this matter serious consideration. I would say at the start that, far from acting as a counterbalance to the family-succession provisions,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1204</span>
which I think is the purpose behind the clause, it would not only defeat family succession, which is the whole point of the changes we have been seeking to make, but it would also seriously limit tenants' lifelong security of tenure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause would introduce a totally new provision into the Bill. The effect would be to exclude from the family succession provisions a tenancy commencing on or after 29th September of this year, as the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) has said, where on or before the commencement of the tenancy the landlord gave notice that possession of the holding might be recovered under the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause would strike at the heart of the family succession scheme and the security of tenure provisions of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948. The Government's succession scheme is designed to allow two transfers within a family. I have already explained at length that we regard this as a fair compromise between the two extremes of family succession in perpetuity and one succession only. To allow opting out at will when a new annual tenancy is granted is totally at variance with our intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee will know, one of the cornerstones of the 1948 Act is lifelong security of tenure for the satisfactory tenant farmer. This is achieved by means of annual tenancies which are automatically renewed each year. Only a few lettings escape the security of tenure provisions—for example, when land is intended for grazing or mowing for a specified period of the year or when it is let on a short-term letting granted with the consent of my right hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause would therefore introduce an entirely new concept, which would erode tenants' security of tenure. I am quite sure that this is something which the hon. Gentleman does not want, especially at a time when we are extending this security through the family succession scheme. If the clause were accepted, landlords might well insist that prospective tenants must be prepared to accept a tenancy on the terms proposed, or could not get the tenancy. Apart from other considerations, I am sure that this would not be in the best interests of good farming. A tenant in this situation, having held the tenancy for over 20 years, would have no incentive
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0660">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1205</span>
to farm to the best of his ability, nor could he plan ahead with any sense of confidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not the point. The choice is not between this form of tenure and the old form of tenure, if I may describe it as that. It is between this form of tenure and no tenure at all. This is what we are saying. We are saying that land will not be let.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be drawn into the argument about availability of tenancies. This has been dealt with at some length by my hon. Friend on earlier clauses. But it would mean that the tenant would be very conscious that his tenancy was to be terminated by the landlord at any time after 25 years without reason and with no right of appeal against the notice to quit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can hardly believe that hon. Members opposite want such a situation, with all the insecurity involved in it. Clearly fixed farm tenancies must be examined with considerable care before any decision is taken for or against their reintroduction. I therefore think that this is something which is better considered in the context of the overall review of the agricultural holdings legislation during the course of the Bill and about which my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary has already spoken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For these reasons, we cannot accept the clause and I hope that, with the interests of good farming at heart, hon. Members will be prepared to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.15 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think the Minister has answered the very valid point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body). This is why some of us who feel strongly that the whole system is coming to an end are so depressed. It will go on, as my hon. Friend said, in ways that get round the security provisions. This, at least, is a system which enables a landlord to let on a fixed term. The security is there for 25 years, which will probably carry him through his lifetime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether any of my hon. Friends wish to say anything further, but I wish to press this to a division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend presses this clause to a Division, because
	<span class='label label-info column'>1206</span>
the point I was trying to make was that this will give a tenant more security than under the Government clauses. Very simple devices will be used to get round this clause in such a way as to give a tenant coming in now less security than he had even under the existing law. This is a certain fact. No landowner, particularly the smaller ones who may have only a few hundred acres and who may well have to sell off part of it because of capital transfer tax some time either in his or his son's lifetime, will give a straightforward tenancy from now on without resorting to simple devices to get round the clauses we have inserted. The result is that the devices to which they will resort, to which I have referred in recent weeks, will give the tenant a great deal of insecurity because he will then be made a junior partner or junior director of a farming company which can be brought to an end at a month's or year's notice. We want to guard against this, because it will put him in a worse position than he is in now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I beg the Minister to reconsider this. I am not asking him to do so this afternoon. He has dug his toes in so deeply this afternoon that it is too tall an order to expect him to go back now. But perhaps between now and Report he could reflect on these points, take some advice from his legal staff as to the various devices which will be used to get round this, weigh up the consequences and see whether this clause would not be to the advantage of the tenant from now on. It would enable a tenant to have an assured 25 years on a farm without the threat hanging over him which he would otherwise have when landlords resort to the kind of devices I have spoken about. I hope that the Minister will reconsider this calmly at some later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the meantime, perhaps the Minister could reflect upon the increase in rents. Not many tenancies will be granted from now on. If he watches the figures he will see a frightening increase in rents now being charged. This is frightening because at the moment, temporarily I believe, farming is all right. But as a Jeremiah on this subject, I am convinced that farming will get into trouble and, when it does, those rents, which are the tenants' first obligation in law, will be very difficult to pay. This will he a great
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0661">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1207</span>
worry to a tenant who will have to agree to pay a rent in excess of what that farm should carry. But he will have to pay it in order to obtain a holding. It will cause great worry, and it is desperately near. I do not want to reflect on the reasons why I think we shall have trouble—the hon Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) is not here to agree with me—but we must not create difficulties for the younger tenants coming in, as they will be, by allowing them to pay such huge increases in rent. It will make it very difficult for them. I beg the Minister to reconsider this when he can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must belabour this point once more, because the Minister of State, for whom we all have a great affection personally, does not seem to have taken this on board. He referred to the security of tenure for tenants and their succession. But it is not a question of succession. These farms which come into hand which the landlords—there will be few of them—will be able to let, but where in fact there are no successions, will be taken in hand or will be sold. They will become owner occupiers or they will be taken in hand. They will not be let. The Minister can ask his advisers up and down the country. There is no doubt about this whatsoever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Stainton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Look at the Rent Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know about the loopholes in the law. I am not a lawyer. I beg the Minister to give this opportunity to many managers—of whom we have spoken before—that they should have an opportunity to have a go at a farm for a good part of their lifetime, after they have trained for 25 years. They will not have the opportunity to get this land because, as I say, it will be sold or taken in hand. They will not he given the opportunity to let, even if this is a limited letting. There is no question of succession at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I were a landlord and I am sure that the hon. Member would agree with me—if I wanted to let a particular piece of land for a period of five years, it could easily be done, in my view, by letting it for 364 days every year
	<span class='label label-info column'>1208</span>
and renewing it. Then the farmer can be the tenant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not a lawyer but I think the Minister will shoot the hon. Gentleman down on this. I have never yet succeeded in letting arable land, at ally rate, on 364 days. The sale of grazing keep, yes, but not this, unless one is Ministry of War, Ministry of Defence or something like that. They can do something quite different from anyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister will, as my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston has just said, reconsider this matter, because it will enable a few more thousand acres to be available to give an opportunity to a chap to have a go on his own.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the closing moments, I must resist the endearments and affection which have been so touchingly expressed, as compared with the claim that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary is an iron lady.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very tempted by the comments of the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) when he said that whatever we do the industry will find some way of getting round it. If that is the case we do not need to worry, although I appreciate his very sensitive advocacy in support of the clause. The fact is that the cornerstone of the 1948 Act has been the way in which the satisfactory tenant can get the annual tenancy renewed automatically almost year by year. There are various exceptions to it, but the point is that this change would be a radical alteration of the existing legislation as well as of the family succession scheme. It would mean that after a certain date the tenant could be given notice that in X years' time he would have to go, with no appeal whatever to the ALT or anyone else. t really goes against the whole concept of the family succession principle which we have been discussing. For those reasons it is impossible for the Government to accept the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am urged to review the situation between now and Report. That is very tempting, but I can say that we shall clearly be looking at quite a number of the aspects of the legislation which have been amended or where amendments have not been made before Report. I am bound to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0662">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
