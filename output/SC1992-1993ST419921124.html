	<div class='legislation'>Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Falkland Islands) Order 1992</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Dorrell)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Falkland Islands) Order 1992.</p></blockquote>
This morning another Committee discussed the double taxation arrangements between this country and Guyana. Until that treaty is given effect, there will be, and in recent years there have been, no double taxation arrangements between the two countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the position between Britain and the Falkland Islands. Indeed, the subject of this morning's debate was positively visionary by comparison with the order this afternoon, which is an extremely detailed, even technical amendment to existing arrangements between the two countries. It concerns the relief due to United Kingdom companies in respect of dividends that they receive from Falkland Islands subsidiaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1984 order extended that relief to take account of tax spared under the specific Falkland Islands Income Tax Ordinance. In 1987 the Falkland Islands Government decided to revise their legislation in this area and introduced the Taxes and Duties (Special Exemption) Ordinance, which had substantially the same effect as the order which is referred to by name in the existing double taxation arrangements between this country and the Falkland Islands. The amendment enshrined in the order merely updates the statutory reference in the existing arrangements and is therefore a textual amendment with no practical effect on the intention underlying the arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also taken the opportunity of the textual amendment to introduce wording that provides for the application of UK tax relief to any substantially similar provisions that may be enacted in future. The amendment is one of very limited scope and I hope that it will commend itself to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.32 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope to catch your eye later, Mr. Adley, in our extensive debate on the subject. Before I do so on matters of substance, however, I should like to welcome you to the Chair. I understand that this is the first time that you have presided over a Committee of this kind. May I congratulate you on your elevation to this important role in the affairs of the House? On behalf of your many friends in the Opposition, may I say how pleased I am that you are presiding over a Committee discussing matters pertaining to the Falkland Islands, in which you have experience and interest. I wish you well in the task that lies before you. I hope that we shall see you in the future on the Committee
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
stage of the Finance Bill—a great treat to which Committee chairmen look forward—and I am sure that your wisdom, good nature and charm will guide us as we deal with this legislative matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I associate myself with the hon. Gentleman's remarks and say how much all Government Members of the Committee welcome your arrival in the Chair, Mr. Adley, and look forward to your firm hand at keeping us within the confines of order and the efficient dispatch of business that that will allow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.33 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Hoon 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ashfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> 
	<i>rose—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I call Mr. Mandelson—sorry, Mr. Hoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, it is a mistake that large numbers of people in this institution make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is not the only Member of the House to suffer from that. I was leaving the Committee this morning when I heard a visitor—my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson) will bear me witness—say as the two of us walked past, "Is that John Prescott?" Some hard things have been said about me in my time, but nothing quite as scathing as that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The draft statutory instrument seeks to amend arrangements between the United Kingdom Government and the Falkland Islands Government concerning relief from double taxation. It applies to income and capital gains taxation, without making specific reference to the subject matter of the tax. That will not come as a great surprise, but what might be considered surprising is the failure to deal in particular with potential oil revenues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if the Financial Secretary would address that issue in the light of two relevant matters. First, the agreement is made between the United Kingdom Government and
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Government of the Falkland Islands".</p></blockquote>
That question must be addressed in the context of the failure of Argentina, in particular, to recognise the Government of the Falkland Islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, as I have mentioned already, where there is the prospect of exploration for oil off the coast of the Falkland Islands, it is necessary when considering taxation to allow for the prospect of that exploration's being successful, with the consequent flows of oil that we hope will result. Suppose that oil is found in any commercial quantity. The exploration appears likely to be successful, because in the past when a preliminary search has been conducted, its results have not been published. It is not an unreasonable deduction that the failure to publish the results of that research might be because it intimated the presence of oil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If oil is discovered, as a result of the agreements entered into the oil wealth will flow through the Falkland Islands, at least in the taxation sense, although it may not go through their physical territory. The Government might have considered that in double taxation terms. If a substantial amount of oil wealth is generated in and around the Falkland Islands, it will produce a significant tax liability for oil companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no apology for mentioning Argentina. The complicating issue is that that oil may not be landed in the Falkland Islands, but may be discovered in the waters
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0483">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
round them and landed in Argentina, creating considerable difficulties for the tax lawyers in the United Kingdom who have to allow for a tax situation where one country—Argentina—does not even recognise the Falkland Islands Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are potential problems that the Government might have addressed in drafting the statutory instrument. The Financial Secretary mentioned one of the problems that I wish to raise with him when he quoted from the Treasury brief. I assume that you have the document, Mr. Adley, as has each Member of the Committee. It is headed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Double Taxation Relief; Motion for Address; Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer—Double Taxation Relief.</p></blockquote>
Has the Financial Secretary that document in front of him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I Do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, [hon. Members: "The Chairman does not."] I am sorry, Mr. Adley. I am making too many assumptions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I refer the Financial Secretary to the paragraph on the second page of the brief which begins "Paragraph 26(2)". He said the any substantially similar provision could be adopted without the need for further legislation, if I understood him correctly. I assume that that would mean that no further legislation would be needed. I should be grateful if, in due course, he would explain that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To continue that theme, the Committee would be interested to know whether, in view of the subsequent taxation regime that would clearly be necessary if large quantities of commercially available oil were subject to tax by the Falkland Islands, any subsequent legislation could be passed under this provision without the matter being referred to Parliament and to a Committee of this sort. That would change fundamentally the nature of agreements made with the Falkland Islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already mentioned the difficulties that would arise if oil were discovered. It would probably not be landed first in the territory of the Falkland Islands but in Argentina, the nearest land to the Falkland Islands. Argentina still claims sovereignty over the surrounding waters where oil might be discovered. Clearly there would have to be an agreement between the Government, the Falkland Islands Government and the Government of Argentina. There would be problems in framing such agreements with a country that does not even recognise the right of the Government of the Falkland Islands in respect of their own citizens. It is difficult to see how they could recognise the responsibility of the Government of the Falkland Islands in relation to double taxation agreements. We know that there have already been preliminary discussion between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of the Falkland Islands on matters such as the harmonisation of legislation, law enforcement and environmental pollution, all of which would clearly be relevant if oil were discovered in Falkand Islands waters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Financial Secretary say whether, in the discussions that have taken place, there was any specific reference to double taxation agreements? If, as has occurred, representatives of the Governments of the United Kingdom, Argentina and the Falkland Islands have been reviewing their legal relationship in the light of oil exploration in particular, which I understood to be the reason for the meeting, the question of double taxation relief is very relevant. There is little point in discussing the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
practical consequences of oil exploration if double taxation and the likely financial benefits to the Falkland Islands are not taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Peter Mandelson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hartlepool)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say just one word to my hon. Friend—squid.—
	<i>[Laughter.]</i> Everything that he said about oil applies equally to squid. Will my hon. Friend, in elaborating his argument to the Financial Secretary, comment on the fact that it is not just in oil exploration that there is potential for dispute between the Governments of Britain, Argentina and the Falkland Islands? What applies to oil applies also to squid. Argentina plans shortly to increase its catches in the south Atlantic of a very lucrative form of squid. I hope that my hon. Friend will not restrict himself to the question of oil in relation to double taxation. It could equally apply to the increasingly important catches of squid and the subsequent problems and disputes that could arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that hon. Members who insist on intervening will try to keep their interventions brief. I point out to the hon. Members for Hartlepool and for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon) That, as far as I am aware, there is no differentiation in the order between squid, oil, or any other commodity or service. Fascinating as it is to know about squid and oil, if hon. Members could occasionally mention double taxation, I should be grateful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Adley. Not for the first time my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool has the advantage of me when he mentions squid. As I represent a landlocked constituency, I have not had my seafaring friend's opportunities and cannot take advantage of these issues. Certainly his knowledge of squid is more extensive than mine and in the light of your comments, Mr. Adley, I shall resist the temptation to develop any arguments about squid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Oil exploration and its double taxation implications are put into context by the agreement which I understand that the Falkland Islands Government have entered into on oil exploration in the south Atlantic. It appears that, for the moment, the agreement presupposes that any benefits deriving from publication of the results of the exploration—not, I emphasise, any benefits deriving from the discovery of oil—will be published and will be shared equally between the companies in question and the Falkland Islands Government. That division, I understand, is the result of pressure exerted by the Argentine Government and I should be grateful if the Financial Secretary would comment on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is possible for the Argentine Government to influence the publication of something as sensitive as a survey of the possible location of gas and oil in the south Atlantic, their influence might also be felt if that discovery led to taxable flows of oil. The oil would have to be landed in Argentina and the Argentine Government would be able to exert a stranglehold on the ability of either the United Kingdom Government or the Falkland Islands Government to tax that oil. Double taxation in the context of the discovery of oil involves more than the Governments of the United Kingdom and the Falkland Islands: it involves the participation of the Argentinians. Clearly the Government of the United Kingdom have already recognised that by inviting Argentina to participate in the preliminary discussions to which I referred. This sort of division over the proceeds of the publication of any survey
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0484">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
might have some relevance to the tax regime that could result from the discovery of oil and I should be grateful if the Financial Secretary would comment on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relevance of this is again underscored in the Treasury's note which mentions mineral royalties. I draw the Financial Secretary's attention to the fourth paragraph on the page headed "Background" which says that the existing arrangement
	<br><blockquote><p>"places limits on the source country taxation of dividends, interest and management fees flowing between the United Kingdom and the Falkland Islands and vice versa."</p></blockquote>
If royalties, interest, dividends and the like are paid by a resident Falkland Islands company, but are received into the United Kingdom, I assume that they are taxable only in the United Kingdom and not at source. That is obviously the purpose of a double taxation agreement and it is the standard form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is significant that the paragraph then goes on to deal with the question of mineral royalties. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Royalties, other than mineral royalties, are exempt from taxation in the source country."</p></blockquote>
That leads me to the assumption that some consideration has been given to what might happen in the event of oil being discovered in the waters of the south Atlantic. The Government clearly have the opportunity, perhaps for our benefit, of developing this line of argument in the context of that statement because it suggests that if mineral revenues are exempted from the normal double taxation arrangement, they will be subject to taxation both in the Falkland Islands and, presumably, on receipt in the United Kingdom, assuming that the company was resident in the UK. I assume also that there would be a difficulty if, as I expect, the oil had to pass through Argentina. That would give rise to questions of jurisdiction and recognition and would be an issue for the Government to resolve in their relationship with Argentina, in the context of the Falkland Islands. I do not wish to make life any more difficult than it is for the Financial Secretary, but it would help us all if we could understand more clearly what is expected, particularly in the light of the provision that refers specifically to mineral royalties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem for UK resident oil companies would be the multiplicities of jurisdictions that could arise, assuming that the oil were discovered in the south Atlantic, transferred to the physical territory of the Falkland Islands and piped on to Argentina before being sold in the international market. I should be grateful if the Financial Secretary would develop an argument on that in the light of the background briefing which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has so helpfully supplied to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have developed my point at length and I am grateful for the Committee's attention and for that of the Financial Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.53 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Milburn 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Darlington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Ashfield for covering some of the ground that I intended to cover. I shall try not to retread his footsteps. However, since I was cut off in my prime this morning, I should like to mention on or two issues of concern on double taxation relief as it applies to the agreement between Her Majesty's Government in the UK and the Falkland Islands Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
The issues that my hon. Friend the Member for Ashfield raised on oil licensing agreements and the potential discovery of large quantities of oil reserves are important. However, my hon. Friend did not cover one matter. I know from comments that the Financial Secretary made this morning during our discussion on Guyana that there are about 100 agreements offering double taxation relief between the UK and other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel strongly that, given the developments in the south Atlantic and, in particular, the crucial economic role played by Argentina in that part of the world, we are in some danger not only of entering into an agreement with the Falkland Islands Government, but almost by default of moving towards agreements with Argentina as well. I illustrate my point with reference to the two commodities which have already been mentioned—oil and squid— specifically in connection with double taxation relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know from a succession of interesting press reports which have been made available to us by my missing hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) that it is very likely that considerable reserves of oil will be found in the waters adjacent to the Falkland Islands. However, if oil is found in commercial quantities around the islands, it is clear that co-operation with Argentina will be essential for development of the reserves. Major gas fields have already been found in Argentine waters between Tierra del Fuego and the Falklands, but so far, as we know, little oil has been found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from the press reports, mainly from the 
	<i>Financial Times,</i> that there is an acceptance of this point on behalf of both the Falkland Islands Government and Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom. Indeed, Mr. Ronald Sampson, is the chief executive of the islands council, made it clear in April this year that local councillors in the Falklands had been made aware by the British Government that in the long term there would have to be much closer co-operation with Argentina in oil exploration. I understand that the initial move to undertake seismic surveys in the waters round the Falklands was made unilaterally by Her Majesty's Government and led to some progress from the Argentine Government which resulted in an agreement that the report of the surveys will be made available to the Government in Buenos Aires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the economic circumstances of the Falkland Islands and the crucial role of Argentina in that part of the world, almost inevitably, when we are considering treaties of this sort, we are discussing not simply a treaty arrangement between Her Majesty's Government and the Falkland Islands Government, but, almost by default, an agreement with the Argentine Government as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool rightly said—even though it was greeted by howls of laughter— that squid fishing in the south Atlantic is of crucial economic significance. I should be surprised if Members had the same reaction to the words haddock, cod, skate or plaice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mandelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason why it is so important and why the inhabitants of the Falklands Islands are bound to be concerned can be readily seen in the recent comment of Mr. Fernando Gutierrez, the Fisheries Under-Secretary in Argentina, quoted in the 
	<i>Financial Times</i> of 21 October 1992. Members of the Committee may or may not be interested to know that that is not only Trafalgar day but my birthday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This was in the 
	<i>Financial Times,</i> not in some unreliable rag from the 
	<i>Hartlepool Mail,</i> such as the Financial Secretary might be likely to leap to his feet to taunt me with. He said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"new regulations would allow up to 40 foreign-owned, special squid fishing vessels, known as jiggers, to operate in Argentine waters and catch up to 100,000 tonnes a year".</p></blockquote>
That is the scale of the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was extraordinarily interesting, but totally irrelevant to the details of this small piece of legislation. I should be grateful if hon. Members would restrict their comments, at least in some respects, to taxation matters rather than to the products of said taxation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Milburn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Adley. That was a little harsh. My hon. Friend's intervention was perhaps tangential to the issue, but none the less of some significance. I will finish this point, if you will allow me to continue, in relation to squid. There is a significant sentence in the 
	<i>Financial Times</i> report of 21 October 1992. It turns out that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Argentina, Britain and Falkland Islands officials will hold a new round of their biannual fishery talks in London next month."</p></blockquote>
It that is not evidence that a direct economic relationship is developing between the Falklands Islands and Argentina, I do not know what is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before becoming bound up with more references to oil and squid, I move on to two specific concerns in the schedule and in the explanatory note. Paragraph 1(2)(b) of the schedule reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any other provision which may subsequently be made granting an exemption or reduction of tax, which is agreed by the competent authorities of the territories to be of a substantially similar character, if it has not been modified thereafter or has been modified only in minor respects to as not to affect its general character."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps that is not clear to hon. Members. Fortunately we have the Treasury's explanatory notes, setting out exactly what it means. Paragraph 2 of the schedule states that the supplementary arrangement will enter into force on notification of the completion of the necessary legal procedures in each territory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now I come to the nub of my agreement, and the key sentence. The arrangement will have effect in the United Kingdom
	<br><blockquote><p>"for any year of assessment beginning on or after 6 April 1987",</p></blockquote>
and
	<br><blockquote><p>"for any financial year beginning on or after 1 April 1987".</p></blockquote>
Those hon. Members who served on the Standing Committee on the Finance Bill in the previous Session will remember the long, detailed discussion, and contentious debate in an overwhelmingly good-natured Committee, on retrospective legislation. I am worried about this provision and ask the Financial Secretary why, if the order is passed
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
today by the Committee, and if the House agrees to it, it will have effect not from 1 or 6 April next year, but, retrospectively, from 1987.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is extremely worrying, because there are well-known conventions in the House about the application of retrospective legislation. It would concern not only hon. Members but, more importantly, our constituents in the outside world, that in November 1992 we are discussing a treaty which, if we pass it, will have retrospective effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Profoundly damaging democratic implications arise from that clause and explanatory note in the schedule. Why 1987? Why not 1988, or 1989—or earlier? The Financial Secretary has some questions to answer over that date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my final point will not be greeted with the howls of laughter that we heard earlier when my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool mentioned squid. It concerns something in the background note that I could not find in the schedule, the order, or the explanatory note, which all Members of the Committee have before them. The penultimate paragraph on the page headed "Background" says that the order will apply to all manner of people. It specifically mentions a category of "temporary business visitors" and reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The earning of temporary business visitors are, with some exceptions, taxed only in the country of the taxpayer's residence. The income of public entertainers is, however, taxable in the country where they perform."</p></blockquote>
That is significant, because Her Majesty's Government, with cross-party parliamentary consent, still have garrisons stationed in the Falkland Islands. I have not had the pleasure of visiting the Falkland Islands, although I understand that you have, Mr. Adley. You shake your head. Even if you have not, you probably know more about them than I do. Hon. Members from both sides of the House have had an opportunity to visit the Falklands. Whatever their attractions, I understand that they are a barren, windswept and lonely part of the world. We have troops there and more than 2,000 resident live on the islands. I understand from a press report that the only form of public entertainment they have—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. George Mudie 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not the sheep!— 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Milburn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only public entertainment is a pub/hotel that provides a video. 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I apologise, Mr. Adley—The sedentary intervention from my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie) has somewhat thrown me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I was trying to address before I was interrupted was that the only form of public entertainment on the Falkland Islands at present is publicly shown videos available at the only public house/hotel on the islands in Port Stanley. Fortuantely, that form of entertainment is now supplemented by public entertainers who fly there from Britain and, I suspect, from other parts of the world to entertain the Falkland islanders and our troops stationed there. Why on earth should they be treated any differently from other temporary visitors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has uncovered a difficulty for the Government. There is also the question of definition. As my hon. Friends know, the Falkland Islands are visited from time to time, no doubt to their great advantage, by the former leader of the Conservative party,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0486">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
now resident in another place. I understand that her visits are much welcomed in the Falkland Islands, as indeed is her departure from these shores.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary may like to consider this difficulty. It is widely reported that the noble lady—and, no doubt, personalities like her—attract large sums of money when they visit foreign countries. Would such personalities be classified as temporary business visitors? It is possible that her affairs and those of people like her could be so categorised. Or would personalities who no longer have direct ministerial responsibility be classified as public entertainers, taxable in the countries where they perform? It is clearly a question of definition to which the Financial Secretary will wish to address himself. The Governments of the Falklands Islands, of Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, The United States and other countries with which we have double taxation arrangements migh also like to address that question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman replies, may I say that the Clerk and I are the only ones who were not supplied with the draft Treasury notes. I have had a chance to look at them, but they have no legal status, and I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman and his Friends would restrict their remarks to the merits of the order itself, fascinating though the notes may be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hendon, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Adley. I think that you and I were thinking along similar lines at broadly the same time—an unusual occurrence. Much of what is being said about the change that the new double taxation agreement produces is out of order. It is designed to benefit companies investing in the Falkland Islands, not the individuals described by the hon. Member for Darlington and other members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for assisting me as to what is in order. I am doing my best to keep all members of the Committee in order, mindful of the fact that I suspect that, whether it is in or out of order, we shall be here until 6 pm. I request hon. members to do their best occasionally to mention the order itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mandelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Adley. I hope that we shall reflect upon your observation in this sense. The explanatory document provided to the Committee elucidates aspects of the order and its implementation which are not directly stated or explained in the order itself. There is, for example, a very important point on the taxation of individuals in the country of the taxpayer's residence. We have already discussed what is and is not the taxpayer's residence and its whereabouts at any given moment of the year. That begs a number of important questions for the operation and implementation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Is this an intervention?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mandelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a point of order, Mr. Adley. I hope that on reflection, you will be indulgent to members of the Committee who wish to draw out the important issues and the implications of the order which can be understood only by reference to the background document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a point of argument rather than a point of order, but no doubt the Financial Secretary will have heard what you said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Milburn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems some time ago since my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East asked me to comment on his intervention. He will be pleased to hear that my remarks are drawing to a close and I hope that the Committee will finish its proceedings at 6 p.m. I do not know whether my hon. Friend intended to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an important matter of general principle about the background notes. I was surprised that neither you, Mr. Adley, nor the Clerk to the Committee had been given a copy because they are important in defining the terms in the schedule and the explanatory note. Without them the Committee would be at something of a loss. I make that point not just for this Committee but because I hope that the House will take it on board more generally in considering statutory instruments and orders such as this. The issue has been pressed in other Committees on which I have had the pleasure of serving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East about the nature of temporary business visitors. I should not have liked to comment on the definition of the role of the former leader of the Conservative party because, whatever I said, my comments would be dismissed as merely party political. But one important issue needs clarification. Why do not public entertainers, who may be members of limited companies or may have their own limited companies, earn the distinction of being temporary business visitors? There is something pejorative in the exclusion of entertainers from that category, particularly in view of their potentially important role vis-a-vis the Falkland Islands. I hope that the Financial Secretary will be able to answer that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On reading the fine print—some hon. Members might say reading between the lines—a number of issues require clarification in what appears to be a straightforward matter. Orders of this kind which have ramifications far beyond their contents should be discussed in considerable detail. If not, we devalue the parly process itself. All members of the Committee would wish to prevent that from creeping into our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Illsley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification on one or two points arising from the order which relate to the 1984 arrangements. Hon. Members have mentioned potential oil exploration in the Falkland Islands and I note that the order refers not only to double taxation relief but to pioneer enterprises, which do not attract tax at all in the Falkland Islands, or within the United Kingdom for companies that have invested in the Falkland Islands. Would oil companies exploring in the Falkland Islands be regarded as pioneer enterprises and therefore not liable to tax in the Falklands, and by the same measure, not liable to tax in this country? Given that oil exploration and development could give rise to substantial profits for oil companies both in this country and in others, it seems that there is some scope for making fast money through oil exploration and development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Financial Secretary tell us what pioneer enterprises are, how many are still classified as such, whether we are still pioneering in the Falkland Islands, and whether we restrict the types of company that can be regarded as pioneer enterprises? It is interesting that hon. Members have referred to exploration for oil, and to note
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0487">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
from recent press reports that that exploration has been delayed. The companies that were invited to tender have not been allowed to continue. It seems that the Falkland Islands Government and our own have delayed the tendering process or repeated it. One wonders whether that is because somebody saw that there could be a possibility of a pioneer enterprise looking for oil being allowed relief from taxation in both countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also interested in the backdating of the Order to 1987, bearing in mind the takeover of the Coalite Group by Anglo United, which gave the Falkland Islands Company to Anglo for a value of £478 million. I doubt that the Falkland Islands Company is worth that much—I think that was the total sum of the takeover. Obviously taxation of Anglo or of Coalite comes under the order, bearing in mind that it is now to be backdated until 1987. Would any of the profits from that sale be caught by the provisions of the order?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Darlington mentioned the Upland Goose Hotel. The Falkland Islands Company is up for sale and is valued at about £10 million. It had pretax profits this year of £1.25 million and, again, depending on the definition of what are and are not pioneer enterprises, it seems that it would be open to anyone in this country to go over to the Falkland Islands, buy some of these enterprise companies in the Falklands and sell them on at a profit that will not, perhaps, be liable to tax in the Falkland Islands and receive relief from tax in this country. Therefore, I should be grateful if the Financial Secretary would give us some idea of where we are in relation to pioneer enterprises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mandelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make two points. The first concerns an issue which arose earlier and to which I made brief reference—the earnings of temporary business visitors who are, in terms of the original order, of which is this a supplementary arrangement, taxed only in the country of the taxpayer's residence. This is a crucial consideration. Will the Financial Secretary, tell us what definition of residence is contained in the order?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is important. In normal circumstances and in other contexts in similar orders relating to tax relief for double taxation, a resident is defined in the terms of the order as any person who is liable to tax where he lives by reason of his domicile, residence or place of management, which seems straightforward and no doubt in most circumstances would be. However, the question arises of what definition of residence would be applied to somebody who lives in two places and in both places and by what means one would determine his status as a resident of one country or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might seem that an obvious way to determine that person's status is in concluding where his permanent home might be. We discussed in the context of a different order what happens if the individual concerned has two permanent homes. Who decides which of the permanent homes is valid and fulfils the criteria we are discussing? It could be where his personal or economic relations are closer, which would suggest that one of his permanent homes is his principal home. If it is not found possible to decide on that basis, it might be considered desirable, or appropriate, to determine the matter on the basis of nationality, but people may have more than one nationality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hate to interrupt the hon. Gentleman's splendid oratorical flow. The Committee was I believe, debating this morning the Guyana order, which was much more elaborate than this one. As I understand the order before us, it deals with resident parent companies. It is a matter relating to companies and not to individuals. I should be grateful therefore if the hon. Gentleman would relate his remarks to the companies and not the individuals who may from time to time be connected with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mandelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may refer you Mr. Adley, to the explanatory note. The question of residency of parent companies applies in this order no less than any other. How will the place of residency be determined in terms of the explanatory note, page 3 of the order, when similar ambiguity arises? It may well be that the place of residency of the company is the location of the effective management. That begs a number of questions. I shall not detain the Committee by rehearsing all aspects of the ambiguity, but the effective management of the company may be fragmented or split between sites and countries and be difficult to determine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point concerns para. 1(b) of the order, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any other provision which may subsequently be made granting an exemption or reduction of tax which is agreed by the competent authorities of the territories."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to refer to the territories in paragraph 2, when it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Each of the territories shall notify to the other through diplomatic channels the completion of the procedures required by its law for the bringing into force of this Supplementary Arrangement."</p></blockquote>
I want to explore the issues of competent authority and diplomatic channels and perhaps the Financial Secretary will cover that in his reply. We would be remiss if we overlooked the fact that double taxation relief and the arrangements prescribed in the order will operate in peculiar circumstances. The competent authorities are the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of the Falkland Islands, and the role of the Government of Argentina is also relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the Financial Secretary to consider the implications for the operation of double taxation relief under the order if the status of the Falkland Islands and the competent authorities were to change. I want to know what the implications would be if the nature and character of those competent authorities changed after the order came into operation. I want to know what the implications would be for "the diplomatic channels" which will provide the means by which such matters will be determined? What will happen as a result of forced or unforced change in the character of the competent authorities if those diplomatic channels were to break down? How would the arrangements prescribed in the order be fulfilled?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I need not labour the point. We are not discussing ordinary circumstances or an ordinary country with a normal diplomatic situation. We cannot discuss the order with a reasonable expectation that the competent authority will remain unchanged for the foreseeable future or that the diplomatic channels to which we have become accustomed and of which we have experience will continue to exist for the foreseeable future. Heaven forbid that there should be a sudden or violent disruption or threat to the arrangements that I have described, as in 1982, but, as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0488">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
parliamentarians and law-makers, we must consider every implication and all possible circumstances which may have a direct bearing on the operation of the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if the Financial Secretary would consider the definition of the residency of the companies which are the subject of the order and how the place of residence would be determined if there was ambiguity. Perhaps he would also explain his thoughts on the operation of the order in the event, albeit unwelcome, of the status of the competent authorities changing and the diplomatic channels breaking down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.34 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mudie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Time guarantees that I shall be brief to allow the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East to argue their cases for as long as they wish. Earner, I interrupted my hon. Friend the Member for Darlington and I think that some of my hon. Friends misunderstood my intervention. I thought that my hon. Friend was about to refer to material which I had carved out with diligent research and that he was going to leave me speechless, but he confined himself to squid and cold windswept helms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friends have made relevant points about the double taxation of oil, and the seafaring Member for Hartlepool—that wonderful port—has raised the subject of squid, it is important for the Minister to understand that the squid industry, which the double taxation regulations will protect, is subsidising the sheep and wool industry in the Falklands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister be able to face his senior colleagues at the Treasury in the knowledge that he has been in Committee protecting an industry that sells its materials at a price lower than the cost of production? I come from a city with a fine tradition in wool. In fact, the coat of arms of Leeds incorporates a sheep.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is fascinating, but could I ask the hon. Gentleman to return to the order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mudie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just wanted to make the point that that shows how deeply people in Leeds feel about wool. The whole prosperity of Leeds was based on wool. Therefore, it pains me—I am sure that you will sympathise with me, Mr. Adley, with your reputation for fairness—to look across the city of Leeds and see no mills in production. Up north, hon. Members gaze across their constituencies and see unemployed people wanting work. If the same subsidies had been given to the wool industry—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying a long way from the point. As he so kindly said, I am a patient and tolerant man, but I should be grateful if he could make some effort to attend occasionally to the subject before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Mudie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I am sure you understand, Mr. Adley, the lure of Leeds and the unfair way in which it is treated by the present Administration justifies my references to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already said that the fishing industry subsidise the wool industry. Hon. Members will be alarmed to know that clean Falklands wool—I regret that my research was not thorough enough to discover the price of dirty Falklands wool—is being sold at £2 per kilogram, while production costs about £2.50 a kilogram.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
One of the individuals in the Falklands who will be covered and affected by double taxation is Councillor Kevin Kilmartin. His party affiliation is not mentioned, but I am sure that, being a good, hard-working person, he is a socialist, although were he a socialist I think that he would run his business somewhat better. He owns Bluff Cove farm and has some good news for the Minister, which will enable the Minister to explain himself to the Treasury when he returns. There are 90 farms on those tiny islands of the Falklands. It reminds me of the Yorkshire dales when I think of that land and those hills, but I shall not depart the subject of from the Falklands. I shall end on this point, but I shall take my time because I have good news for the Minister. My point also touches on the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Darlington, which you, Mr. Adley, ruled out of order. I think, however, that after the discussions that you have had with my colleagues— which I look forward to having with you on future Finance Bills—that point will be in order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question concerned visitors being either business visitors or public entertainers. Will the Minister tell us into which category the solution to the Falklands wool industry falls when I tell him that Councillor Kevin Kilmartin and his 89 farming colleagues are importing, from who knows where, 650 rams that will service 650,000 sheep? The end product will be a finer wool.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Milburn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can help my hon. Friend with some information. Those 650 rams are being inported from Tasmania.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have gone a long way from the Falklands and I do not want to go even further. We have only 18 minutes left.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mudie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend and I look forward to being told by the Minister, with the help of the resources that he has to hand, whether the sheep will fall into the category of business visitors or entertainers. With a ratio of 1:1,000 they are probably business visitors not entertainers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be delighted to know that more than £260,000 is being spent to bring the sheep to the Falklands. Again, because of a lack of research resources, I am not sure whether those are Falkland, Tasmanian or British pounds. However, that amount is being spent. The Minister will be able to go back to the Treasury with a smile on his face and with the Knowledge that the subsidy that he has not given and will not give to the engineering industry, the construction industry or the wool industry in Leeds, he has given to the wool industry in the Falklands, which may have a limited life span, in the knowledge that those 650 rams trotting over the hills will be his salvation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been interested in the debate. I spent last weekend reading a book called "Westminster: Does Parliament Work?" by the hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Garrett). In it he criticised the work of Standing Committees. The events of today have served to reinforce his argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What amazes me about this discussion is that, for the Falklands or, indeed, any other underdeveloped parts of the world to prosper, they must encourage inward investment. The agreement does that. If hon. Members want that part of the world to prosper, they should support
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0489">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
the Government in the Division. If they vote against the agreement, they will be voting against inward investment in the Falkland Islands. I hope that it will be recognised in that part of the world and elsewhere that there are hon. Members who would vote against developments in an underdeveloped part of the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a good contribution from the hon. Gentleman and all the better for being concise. The official Parliamentary Opposition do not intend to delay unduly the passage of the legislation. As for inward investment, I think that Labour Members will wholly endorse what the hon. Gentleman said. We are not against inward investment to the Falkland Islands. Indeed, we should like to make the same case for Hartlepool, Leeds and Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor of the Exchequer may chose to describe those parts of Great Britain as "not the south" and refer to Scotland and Wales as the territories, but those of us who were elected to represent those areas take a somewhat different view. We wish that the Government would shower the same affection on the parts of this country whose economies are depressed as they are showering on the Falkland Islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a great pleasure to refer to the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East, in which he suggested that the Financial Secretary could go back to the Treasury with a smile on his face. I know that he will do that anyway—the Financial Secretary is a cheerful soul and always the light and soul of the Committee work of the Treasury teams. We are all looking forward to his summing up.

My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East referred briefly to sheep and to companies which farm sheep in the Falkland Islands whose tax reliefs will be dealt with under the order. The production of sheep and their export and sale are important, but I am surprised that we did not hear a word from Conservative Members about the consumption of meat. Some of those sheep will be eaten in Basildon. The hon. Member for Basildon is present and yet, on this vital issue—the consumption of lamb—which pertains to Basildon, he has had, unusually, nothing to say, although there was clearly time for him to take part in the debate.

I appreciate that several questions have been put to the Financial Secretary. I have three of my own. First, can he confirm that we are effectively updating the 1984 arrangement? It would be proper for once, and unusual for the Financial Secretary, accurately to describe the agreement as an evolution from the earlier agreement. As the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) would have pointed out had he been here, the legislation is retrospective. Admittedly, it is restrospectively granting reliefs rather than imposts, but I know how passionately the right hon. Gentleman says that he feels about retrospective legislation. I am sure that you, Mr. Adley, appreciate that the Opposition operate under a handicap when we are twinned with other parties who cannot be relied upon to oppose the Government and who, on great issues of principle which the Prime Minister describes as matters of confidence, actually vote with the Government. Labour Members feel that the Liberal
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
Democrats' presence on the Committees should come out of the Government's allocation and that we should be allowed more representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The retrospective legislation begs the question why we have a double tax treaty at all with the Falkland Islands. After all, its relationship with the United Kingdom is not the same as that of Guyana or the United States or other sovereign states with whom we make agreements. The answer is to ensure that there is tax relief for those companies which invest in the Falkland Islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is backdated to 1987 because in that year the Government abolished a piece of legislation relevant to the Falkland Islands. They are now trying to confirm that position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary shakes his head. I should be grateful if he will explain why we need this restrospective legislation and what is the statutory authority in the Falkland Islands which must have pertained between 1987 and now. If there is such a statutory authority, why cannot it continue? Why do we need this order? Why did the Financial Secretary decide on the period of time stated in paragraph 1(b) which was referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Darlington? I accept the need for a period of time, but why choose 10 years? I do not challenge the choice, but merely want it explained.

The arrangements are extensive, as is the treaty. They would cover a population of 2,100 who live on an island for which over 1,000 soldiers died to preserve it independence. Heroic efforts were made to defend that territory and substantial sums of money have been spent on it since. Between 1982 and 1987 £30 million of subsidies has been channelled into civilian expenditure—that is expenditure by companies whose tax affairs will be governed by the arrangements. A further £3 billion has been spent on defence of the territories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In scrutinising this legislation, we must be satisfied that there will be no scope for tax evasion or tax planning which could defraud the British Exchequer. Hon. Members have referred to the industrial issues which will be bound up in the arrangements. They have spoken properly about the industries of squid, fishing—which is being expanded—and wool. The industry that is of most concern and which has attracted most comment is oil. International oil corporations may be able to take advantage of the arrangements to gain tax relief on the exploration part of their operations.

It is desirable that agreement is reached between the Falkland Islands and Argentina. However, that may enable the arrangements to be used to avoid paying tax either to the British Government or to the Argentine Government. I should not like us to enter into an arrangement which effectively became a tax avoider's charter for those who can afford to pay their fair share of tax. Can the Financial Secretary assure us that that would not happen?

There is much more that I could say and I know that there is much more that the Committee would like to hear, but we have only one and a half hours in which to debate the matter. It is not the Opposition's purpose unduly to delay the measure reaching the statute book, as long as the

Financial Secretary provides reasonable answers to our questions. I shall conclude now to afford the Financial Secretary the opportunity to speak about those matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The best way in which to answer the Opposition's questions may be to focus the Committee's mind on precisely what we are discussing. The 1984 arrangement was brought into effect by Order in Council in 1984. That arrangement contained a provision to ensure that we did not tax profits which were exempt from taxation in the Falkland Islands under the provisions of the pioneer company element of its domestic legislation. The 1984 arrangement, which was put into effect by the 1984 order, referred to the domestic legislation which provides for that pioneer company arrangement in the Falkland Islands. Since the Falklands Islands Government amended their legislation and introduced a new ordinance in 1987, the double taxation arrangement has been out of date because it refers to legislation which was repealed and replaced by the Falkland Islands Government with effect from 1987. The sole purpose of this arrangement is to delete in the existing order reference to the legislation on the Falkland Islands statute book which was repealed in 1987 and replace it with a reference to the legislation which the Falkland Islands Government introduced in 1987. That is the reason for the retrospection to 1987.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was properly asked about the position in the mean time. If a claim had been made, we would have allowed relief which was not directly provided for in legislation since the arrangement refers to Falkland Islands legislation which is no longer on the statute book. It is clear that the intention from 1984 onwards has been to grant relief when the Falkland Islands Government provide relief to pioneer companies. The arrangement is being backdated to 1987, giving it retrospective effect. The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East properly described the measure as a relieving rather than an imposing one. The reason for backdating it is to ensure that there is consistent statutory
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
authority from 1987 onwards for any relief under the terms of this arrangement, the intention of which has been the same from the day on which it was introduced in 1987. The statutory authority under which the provision is implemented as delegated legislation is now, although it was not in 1984, in section 788 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, subsection (5) of which contains a definition of pioneer companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked why pioneer companies are entitled to that relief for 10 years under our domestic legislation. The purpose of relief for pioneer companies is to encourage investment in developing countries. It is reasonable that when that investment has been made, has taken root and is generating profits, the special arrangements that were made available to encourage the investment should come to an end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hartlepool referred to the question of residence. I assure him that the provisions for residence in this arrangement as in the treaty covering Guyana, are the OECD model terms governing residence. The Labour party when in power was content that those terms should form the basis of double taxation relief arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked what would happen if the arrangements for sovereignty of the Falklands Islands changed. That question would have to be covered in any legislation which changed the status of the Falkland Islands.

I commend the motion to the Committee.
