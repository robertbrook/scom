	<br><blockquote><p>"() The Court shall, in giving a direction, consider whether there is a need for separate representation of any children, and upon making an order for separate representation may appoint a panel guardian, and these shall be considered specified proceedings within the meaning of section 41 of the 1989 Act.".—[

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 32, in clause 13, page 9, line 29, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) for the purpose of appointing a guardian ad!item to protect the interest and welfare of any child of the family.".</p></blockquote>
No. 33, in clause 13, page 9, line 32, after "family" insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"whose interests and welfare shall be a paramount consideration.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. Jonathan Evans)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier today I was outlining the power of the courts under section 7(1) of the Children Act 1989 to order the production of a welfare report that would often involve talking to the children about their wishes and feelings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Julian Brazier 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Canterbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend anticipates what I am about to say, so I am happy to give way to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Several members of the Committee hope to return to that issue when we debate schedule 8. Consulting the children about their wishes is central to the amendment and it is something that both sides of the Committee are concerned about, particularly the mechanism that will be used by the court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of my hon. Friend's recognition of the role that is performed by family court welfare officers. He has told me that that structure is working well in his area and that his primary concern is the way in which it operates in other parts of the country. Although we shall discuss that substantive issue in due course, mechanisms are already in place that
	<span class='label label-info column'>236</span>
involve talking to children about their wishes and feelings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If obtaining the welfare report means that additional time is needed before the court can consider the issues under dispute, it already has the power to adjourn the proceedings as suggested in amendment No. 32. When the court is seriously concerned about the welfare of a child to the extent that it believes that it may be appropriate for a care or supervision order to be made, the court may direct the appropriate authority to investigate the child's circumstances under section 37(1) of the Children Act. Such a process is already designated as specified proceedings under section 41 of the Act, and a guardian ad litem may be appointed in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Children can make an application or apply to become a party to the Children Act proceedings. In both cases, they are eligible to apply for legal aid. The court, in considering such an application, must decide whether the child is of sufficient understanding. Such principles were set out in the famous Gillick case. There is concurrent jurisdiction between all tiers of court in Children Act matters. A direction of the president of the family division specifies that in all cases when an application is made by the child, the proceedings should be transferred to the High Court where the services of the official solicitor are available, if that should be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those services are already available to ensure that the welfare of the child is protected and that children's views are heard. It is at such cases that the resources of legal aid, the court welfare services and guardians ad litem are rightly targeted. We must remember that the primary responsibility for the upbringing of children rests with parents. Indeed, the court will not make an order under the Children Act unless it is satisfied that to do so will be better for the child than not making an order at all. If parents and children are fully involved in the decision-making process outside the court room, the chances of workable arrangements lasting long term are much better than if the arrangements are imposed on families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why the Government are introducing provisions for the state funding of mediation. Mediators will always remind parents of their parental responsibility and of the need to take into account the views of their children when reaching an agreement on their upbringing. The family will be making decisions together. Research that has been undertaken by a group in Newscastle shows that, as a result of mediation, parents generally feel more able to talk to their children about what is happening in the divorce process. They are more able to listen to their children's concerns and help them cope with the divorce, taking into account what really lies at the heart of such matters. We therefore need to consider what extending the provisions for the separate representation of the child would mean in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not clear how far amendment No. 31 seeks to extend the provision for separate representation, because it would amend a clause dealing only with directions in relation to meetings with mediators. In principle, separate representation means that children may need to attend court more often, that they may have to take sides for or against a parent and that they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0139">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>237</span>
may be asked to explain that view to a court. That is an onerous burden to place on a child, which is why the current provisions oblige the court, in determining whether a child should be allowed to make an application, to consider whether the child understands the consequences of its actions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's purpose is to reduce acrimony and hostility. I am worried that the amendments may inadvertently increase them. We should be careful not to encourage children to believe that they can prevent their parents from parting when the breakdown of the marriage may be irretrievable. In such cases, children may feel guilty; they may believe that it is they who have failed and that the breakdown could somehow be attributed to them. We need also to remember, however much we may wish it not to be the case, that what children want and what may be best for them are not always the same. What of the parent who is subjected to regular physical abuse that is witnessed by the child? The child may love both parents despite the violence and may want them to stay together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To place children in a position where they may be asked to defend one partner or to accuse the other party may not have been intended. Thus, although I understand the spirit in which the amendments were moved, I believe that they could increase acrimony in proceedings, dilute available expertise and be more distressing for children. I am sure that that was not intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 33 would require the court, when considering whether to adjourn proceedings connected with the breakdown of a marriage, to have as a paramount consideration the interests and welfare of any child of the family. Clause 13 is about the power of the court to adjourn. The court can adjourn to allow the parties to comply with a direction to attend a meeting to explore the benefits of mediation and to take advantage of mediation if they wish, or so that disputes between them may be resolved amicably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When considering whether to so adjourn, the court is required to have regard to the need to protect the interests of any child of the family. That must be right, and it will mean that the court is required to assess whether the additional delay imposed by an adjournment would be detrimental to the interests of any child of the family, or whether the harmful effects that could result from such a delay were outweighed by the benefits that might be obtained by the parents being given the opportunity to give serious consideration to mediation or another method of amicable resolution of their disputes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the wording of the Bill is right. We are talking about procedures relating to the divorce of two adults. The effect that the parent's actions will have on their children is important, but it is not appropriate to say that, in relation to decisions made by the court about the dissolution of the marriage, the children's interests override those of the parents in all circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister cares to read amendment No. 33 in conjunction with amendment No. 32 he will see the logic of it. Amendment No. 32 is about appointing a guardian ad litem. Amendment No. 33 states the interests and welfare of the child
	<span class='label label-info column'>238</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall be a paramount consideration".</p></blockquote>
Reading both amendments together will show that if the child needs separate representation, that will be an overriding consideration for the court when deciding whether to adjourn. It is perfectly logical. If the Minister reads the two amendments together there is no problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have dealt with separate representation; I said that, although the children's interests were important, they should not override the interests of the parents. I ask the Committee to focus on that core issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 13, the court will not make orders relating to the residence of, or contact with, children. When the court makes such orders under the Children Act, the welfare of the children, as the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) well knows, is paramount—that provision is contained in section 1 of the Children Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where it can be shown that the legal dissolution would result in substantial financial or other hardship to a child, the court may—as we were reminded during our debate on clause 10—make an order, under that clause, barring divorce. In such cases, therefore, the interests of a child would prevail. I do not think it right, however, that where a marriage has irretrievably broken down an empty legal shell of a marriage should be preserved unless it is necessary to do so to protect one of the parties or the children by involving the hardship bar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, it is important to minimise the trauma and bitterness for children that marital breakdown will inevitably cause; that is why the general principles clause states that regard must be had to that fact. However, research shows that children suffer at the time of breakdown in their parents' marriage and at separation. What causes suffering for the children may not be the dissolution, but the breakdown and separation. By the time of legal dissolution, the damage has already been done. Preserving a dead marriage in those circumstances, so that the parties can continuing warring, does nothing at all to help children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a serious misunderstanding about how the divorce court operates when exercising its function under section 41 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. That has been the subject of much discussion between officials in my Department and representatives from the various children's organisations. In exercising its function under section 41, the court is not making decisions relating to children. Likewise, when the court is dissolving a marriage, it is not making decisions relating to children. When the court makes decisions under the Children Act 1989, it is, of course, making decisions relating to children, and, under that Act, the welfare of the child is of paramount importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may help the Committee if I explain how the section 41 system operates. I would be grateful if Committee members kept in mind that we are talking about a procedure that acts as a bridge between the divorce procedure and procedures under the Children Act. A judge will consider the matters that are specified under section 41(1) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, in accordance with the provisions of family proceedings rules. Rule 2.39, made in 1991, provides for the judge to certify that he is satisfied that there are no children of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0140">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>239</span>
the family to whom section 41 applies, or that there are such children but that there is no need for the court to exercise its powers under the Children Act or give any direction under section 41(2) of the 1973 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rule continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the district judge is not satisfied as mentioned in paragraph (2) … he may, without prejudice to his powers under the Act of 1989 or section 41(2) of the Act of 1973, give one or more of the following directions—

	<ol>

	<li>that the parties, or any of them, shall file further evidence relating to the arrangements for their children (and the direction shall specify the matters to be dealt with in further evidence);</li>

	<li>that a welfare report on the children, or any of them, be prepared;</li>

	<li>that the parties, or any of them, shall attend before him at the date, time and place specified in the direction;
and that the party shall be notified accordingly." </li></ol></p></blockquote>
It will be noted that the court has power to require parties to file further evidence and also to order a welfare report or require the parties to attend before the judge. If the circumstances suggest that the court is likely to have to exercise its powers under the Children Act, the matter will be taken further under the Children Act, whereas I have said that decisions made by the court must proceed on the basis that the welfare of the child is paramount. I am aware that there is some considerable misunderstanding about the function of section 41. It is worth repeating that the court is not, under section 41, making decisions relating to children—that is, making or confirming orders in relation to residence or contact. Those decisions are made under the Children Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware, from what the children's charities consortium has said to officials in my Department, that there is concern among the children's organisations about the fact that the section 41 procedure does not always alert judges to problem cases. We have asked the organisation for evidence of such cases, and we have also discussed with them ways in which the court might be put in a better position to discover whether a particular case should be looked at further and dealt with under the Children Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have told children's organisations that we will examine the documentation and any other evidence that is placed before the court under section 41 to see whether it might be improved further, so placing the court in an even better position to decide whether or not there is a problem as regards the children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the matter of consulting children, hon. Members will be aware that the Government have tabled amendments to clauses 8, 11 and 24 that emphasise the importance of the welfare, wishes and feelings of children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister gave an undertaking—for which I am grateful—that he would look at all the research and evidence produced. I asked him to look at a booklet prepared by the Children's Society entitled "Separate Representation of Children in Private Law Proceedings in Cleveland." I also asked him to consider the concerns that many judges have expressed about separate representation for children in such proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope to highlight the level of contact with children's organisations. The hon. Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column'>240</span>
referred to a specific booklet. I can provide him with five booklets that my Department, the Department of Health, children's rights organisations and others produced collectively to highlight children's rights. The idea that that concept is new to the Lord Chancellor's Department is somewhat wide of the mark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister read those booklets?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a member and supporter of Childright and other children's charities, three of the five volumes are very familiar to me. Parents will be reminded about such important matters during information meetings by the lawyers advising them and by mediators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the interest in the position that children's organisations have adopted, I shall mention the further dialogue that there has been between officials in my Department and those organisations. We have told those organisations that, when we examine the section 41 documentation in consultation with them, we will consider the possibility of incorporating a question on the statement of arrangements which will ask the parents whether or not they have consulted their children about the proposed arrangements and whether they have taken account of their children's views when making arrangements, as they will be required to do under the amendments to which I referred earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also told the children's organisations that, when we consult on the detail of the information that should be given during information meetings, we will consult them about the appropriate form of written leaflet suitable for children, which we could include in an information pack that would be given to parents attending information meetings. Written information for children is a complex matter. We must be sensitive to children's needs. It is easy to get such information wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that written information is a sensitive matter. Therefore, does not he make the case for separate representation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had highlighted my fear that that would only increase hostility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Boateng 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brent, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to respond to the point made by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd). He was saying that it was in some way wrong for the Lord Chancellor's Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Children's Legal Centre, to inform children about the divorce process; that we should desist from that; and, instead, should be ensuring that children are separately represented. The hon. Gentleman is suggesting that as an alternative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with the hon. Gentleman's point about separate representation. I am now dealing with the importance of ensuring that the requisite information is drawn to children's attention and with the widespread dialogue with children's organisations that has taken place to achieve that. The fact that that is complex is no reason for the Government not to do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0141">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>241</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should not put a wrong construction on what I said. I did not say that those leaflets should not be produced. I welcome them; they are perfectly reasonable and proper. I am saying that, in addition, in some cases there might be a need for representation at arm's length to the proceedings by another qualified person, not to create more stir, but to act as a mediator for one party in the break-up—not for the husband or the wife, but the child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members who have been present since 4.30 pm will have heard me talking about guardians ad litem and separate representation. Perhaps the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy was not here to hear all my remarks. I am now dealing with the specific concerns that were raised by children's organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know of the close link that my hon. Friend the Minister had with the NSPCC before taking up ministerial office. Many of us on the Conservative Benches welcome the fact that he will be consulting closely again between now and Report stage. That is obviously the best way to resolve the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend I was talking about the dialogue that there has been with children's organisations and I am highlighting the fact that although the Government are not inexperienced in providing information for children, clearly children's organisations are involved in that process. We believe that all the steps that I have outlined will be beneficial, not least in gradually changing the culture so that it becomes natural for parents to consult their children at important milestones in their lives, especially on the arrangements following marriage breakdown. The proposal to impose a legal duty on parents to consult their children will be unworkable in the context of the Bill. We already have a Children Act 1989, a comprehensive code relating to the law on children, which works well. The so-called Scottish duty is provided by the Scottish equivalent—the Children (Scotland) Act 1995. Such a provision in this Bill would have nothing on which to hang and would be unenforceable. It is better to consider ways to change the culture and attitudes and to find workable and practicable ways to remind parents to take their children's views into account. We need to find ways of providing better information about the importance of children's wishes and feelings. We should also ensure that the courts are alerted to the problems of children involved in divorce cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is extensively briefed, but his response is totally inadequate. Nothing in his remarks gives us hope that his Department has taken seriously, or reflected on to any purpose, the message that he has received from the children's organisations to which he referred. He made great play of the dialogue that has occurred between his Department's officials and children's organisations, but dialogue requires a willingness to listen and to act. In so far as there has been dialogue, it has been characterised by a remarkable degree of inertia on the part of the Minister and his Department. They have strained to produce a leaflet and that simply is not good enough. The Minister's suggestion that the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant
	<span class='label label-info column'>242</span>
Conwy has somehow got it in for leaflets is not worthy of the argument that he is trying to sustain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to examine the Minister's argument in a little more detail and to take him up on a number of points. He suggests without one iota of supporting evidence—we gave him several opportunities to respond—that separate representation to the court to protect the child's interests would somehow cause the child to feel fearful and would create antagonism between the child and the parents. That is a serious, remarkably bald assertion, which is unsubstantiated by research or evidence. If research data shows that that happens, or has happened, I shall willingly give way to the Minister so that he can outline it. Does evidence exist to support the Minister's bald assertion that the separate representation of a child to protect its interest is likely to antagonise the relationship between the child and its parents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman has asked me to respond, I shall do so. We are considering the matter in the context of mediation. Two parties come to see the mediator. Alongside them, according to the hon. Gentleman's proposal, is a solicitor who represents the interests of their children. If the hon. Gentleman requires research to prove that that has the capacity to create friction between the children and their parents, he needs research to prove everything under the sun.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The Minister is on shaky ground. Does he seriously suggest that having someone who is independent of both parties to speak on behalf of a child and raise its anxieties in the dialogue would create antagonism or place a burden on the parents? Is no one to speak up for the child? Is the matter to be left to two adults who, according to research evidence, are working through trauma and crisis and are often the least equipped at the time to protect the interests of their children? It is remarkable to suggest that the amendment has got it wrong and could damage children's interests because it tries to give the child a voice in deliberations that will fundamentally affect the future of a young being. It is an incredible assertion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir Jim Lester 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned by the way in which the debate is progressing. The National Family Mediation service makes it plain in its guidelines and in its relationship with courts and the probation service that mediators, who do not argue for the interests of any individual, have a special concern for the welfare of children and must encourage participants to focus on their needs as well as their own. How many people, who must have the interests of children at heart, should participate in the discussions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman takes a great interest in such matters and has considerable experience and knowledge of them. The primary concern about the suitability of mediation is that it is posited on the notion that the parties will act reasonably. They do not. All too often in the trauma of the break-up of a relationship, the parties do not act reasonably. A mediator cannot be expected to hold a torch for the child as well as holding the ring between the parties.

Somebody has to hold a torch for a child in the mediation process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mediators acknowledge that there is still much more work to be done before it can be said with any degree of certainty how mediation is effectively to meet the needs of children in this process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give the hon. Gentleman an example of one area where concern was expressed by National Family Mediation in 1994. Again, it is referred to in Richards' Cambridge paper for the Centre for Family Research on the interests of children at divorce which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Recently a few mediators have placed more emphasis on obtaining a view from children as part of the mediation process."</p></blockquote>
That is not par for the course in mediation. Members of the Committee should know that. This is new territory. In the past, mediators have not seen it as their role necessarily to obtain a view in relation to children. Richards continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is usually done by seeing the children in separate sessions as an adjunct to the mediation itself'.</p></blockquote>
That is the practice adopted in those few mediations carried out by the National Family Mediation. Richard goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, it is unclear how such views are incorporated into the mediation process or how they might influence the outcome. Again, this approach is rare and unevaluated."</p></blockquote>
That means that we do not know enough and what we do know we are incapable at this time of assessing in terms of its value to the child and the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the work that has been carried out under the Children Act and the Children's Society work in Cleveland to which my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Mr. Tipping) referred, we know the sort of cases where judges who are used, day in and day out, to dealing with this area of family breakdown, believe that a separate representation would have been of assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give the Minister some examples. One is the case of a contested contact application where the child was being damaged emotionally due to the parents' hostility and unreasonableness towards each other. The parents had no realisation of what they were doing to that child. It is no use the Minister saying that it will be part and parcel of the function of the mediator to bring them to a realisation of that. Unless there is specific provision for the mediator to see the child, how on earth would the mediator know what the impact of the parents' relationship had been on the child? Are we to rely on the parents in those circumstances? The Minister is living in cloud cuckoo land if he thinks that this will satisfy us. Does he really suggest that we should rely on a column that the parents tick before they go into the process as to whether the child is being damaged by what the parents are doing to each other?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another example is the case of a seven-year-old deaf child. There was parental conflict regarding contact. The mother was unwilling to allow the child to see the father. The child was able to express views but there was no independent assessment or representation of that child's views. There was the case where a child was handed over by the parents to the grandparents. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>244</span>
parents requested contact after 10 years and the grandparents and child opposed the contact. Separate representation by guardian ad litem could have investigated the situation. It was not there. For the Minister to suggest that the existing law is good enough is disingenous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to rule 9.5 of the family proceedings rules. Again it was said, "That rule is there. Why do you need more?" We need more because the rule does not lay a duty on the court to consider whether there is a need for separate representation; it gives no power to appoint a panel guardian, as established by section 41 of the Children Act 1989 and it gives no power to add section 8 residence and contact orders to the list of specified proceedings laid out in section 41 of the Act. Guardians cannot be appointed in non-specified proceedings and, unless the proceedings and, unless the proceedings are specified, there is no one to pay for the guardian. We seek in this modest amendment to meet the existing deficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mrs. Justice Bracewell, as part of her work as chair of the Children Act advisory committee, has recommended that the role of the panel guardian be extended to cover situations of residence and contact under section 8 where the court considers, but currently cannot order, separate representation. That is the body of opinion that lies behind the amendment. It is not a question of handing over our judgment in these matters to outside organisations; it is one of making sure that our judgment is informed by what is going on. Mediation is moving into an area which is untested and untried. It is an area in which there is every reason to believe that mediation will not always be appropriate and that where it is, another voice may be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister, in his response, talked about mediation as if it would always necessarily provide forums in which those issues might be resolved. What of those couples who are unable to find in mediation an appropriate way forward? Such research as there is indicates that mediation is probably appropriate for only 30 to 40 per cent. of the couples concerned. Suppose one falls into the 60 or 70 per cent.? In forums what would one seek to deal with the issues?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are crucial as a practical means of meeting a child's needs. Other members of the Committee will, no doubt, have something to say on that issue. Our attitude is that the amendments are central to the welfare of children and to the manner in which the Bill must be improved if it is to provide a context in which marriages can be dissolved in circumstances which do not remove—it is difficult to remove the harm done to children during the dissolution of a marriage—but at least mitigate harm. That is why we intend to press the amendments to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) in saying that I am grateful that the Minister will have further discussions with children's organisations before the Report stage. I hope that he will have made progress before the matter arises again on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's careful exposition of the current situation made it clear that there are occasions when a child is independently represented before a court. The Minis-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0143">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>245</span>
ter was at pains to point that out. He said it with some pride. It is important to acknowledge that there are situations in which there is a need for separate representation for a child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thrust of the Minister's response was that he had hoped to establish a framework in which children can be consulted and their views heard, then filtered through a third party—their parents or their parents' legal advisors. That kind of filter, however, can lead to distortion. I ask the Minister again to look at the excellent publication by the Children's Society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's remarks tend to ignore section 7 of the Children Act 1989, which empowers the court to request a welfare report. That is an important element in the process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is right that a welfare report can be undertaken. I do not deny that. The difference between the Minister and other Members is small. The Minister has accepted that there should sometimes be direct representation. All I ask is that he look at the matter again and, specifically, that he read the children's Society publication "Separate Representation of Children in Private Law Proceedings in Cleveland". That acknowledges the voices and concerns of judges in a number of cases in which children's rights and futures were affected but the judge was powerless to consult properly on the child's view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Jim Lester</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many of us will know of constituency cases in which there have been court welfare reports suggesting that the child's interest is in contacting both parents, but the mother or father—if the father has custody—prevents it. That is contrary to the child's interests and to the will of the court. I have had cases in which no judge can change the situation; the father is denied access to the child although the child has had a court welfare report saying that he wants to see his father from time to time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a point with which we are all familiar. Clearly, welfare reports are drawn up. Equally clearly, many recommendations are not followed. That point strengthens my argument. The child's rights are impinged by that. The point adds weight to the case for separate representation for children. I ask the Minister to look again at the Children's Society publication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked warmly about the Children's Act advisory committee during our last sitting, and it is recognised as an important professional body. The chairman, Mrs. Justice Bracewell has recommended that the role of panel guardians be extended. I hope that the Minister will return to that point on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I and others reminded the Minister before we adjourned for lunch of the undertakings given by the Lord Chancellor in January 1989, before the Children Act of that year had been enacted. There was an undertaking that the role of the family court welfare service and of guardians ad litem would be considered. There would be a fundamental review, and new proposals would be introduced. We are now several years on, so perhaps the Minister could give the Committee an
	<span class='label label-info column'>246</span>
account of current thinking on those matters. We are all keen to ensure that children who are in difficult, tense and stressful situations receive the best possible representation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There will therefore be no opportunity for further debate on clause 26 after this group has been debated. Members of the Committee should bear that in mind when making their contributions to the debate on this group of amendments. There will, of course, be an opportunity to vote on the proposed amendments, and on the question of whether the clause—as amended or not, as the case may be—should stand part of the Bill, when we come to the appropriate point in the proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir Jim Lester</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to try and establish, beyond peradventure, that we want mediation to work wherever it is possible. Mediation is probably a better way of reconciling divorcing parents, children and the rest than the formal activities of a court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need first to consider the definition of family mediation. The National Family Mediation code of practice, from which I quoted earlier on the subject of children, gives the following definition.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Family Mediation is a process in which an impartial third person assists those involved in family breakdown, and in particular separating or divorcing couples, to communicate better with one another and to reach their own agreed and informed decisions about some or all of the issues relating to or arising from the separation, divorce, children, finance or property.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Mediation is thus an alternative to decision-making by the courts. It is not part of the decision-making procedures of the court."</p></blockquote>
That is the background to the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important fact is that there is a need to safeguard the principle of voluntariness. For anyone who is not sure about that word—I had to look it up, not having heard of it before, but it is a legal word—it can be explained in a long phrase as the principle of freedom to negotiate without coercion. That is the most important element in the amendments. A particular concern is the question of voluntariness in court referrals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Family mediators provide out-of-court mediation and have always been scrupulous in emphasising and realising the principle of voluntariness as essential to the success of mediation. The reasons are clear. Mediation is essentially a private and informal decision-making process, and that is its strength. However,
	<span class='label label-info column'>248</span>
because of that it does not include the safeguards of due legal process. Therefore, it requires high standards of training and practice to secure the participation of the two parties. Experience suggests that mediation is likely to be effective only when the couples involved feel that they are committed to the process. Success is unlikely if they do not feel that commitment, or if they feel that they have not entered the process by choice, with a willingness to adhere to the results. It is not suitable for everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) has said that we are in new territory with regard to the use of mediation. In some cases—perhaps in quite a lot—mediation is not suitable and that will quickly be realised. It is unlikely to be appropriate in cases in which there is extreme antagonism between the parties, or domestic violence, or an irredeemable power imbalance in the relationship. It can never be treated as compulsory without great risk to the whole process. A forced agreement is a contradiction in terms. At some point in mediation, if not always at the outset, both parties must be prepared to work. Unless both contribute and negotiate, clearly there will be no mediation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Kent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand precisely what my hon. Friend is saying; it is clear that one can lead a horse to water but not make it drink. The question is whether there is merit in the Bill's ensuring that the horse is led to the water. There is merit in that idea, because a lot of couples will not understand at all what mediation can do for them. It seems worth considering that the opportunity should be laid before them, even if, in the end, for such reasons as my hon. Friend has so ably set out, they decide not to go ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Jim Lester</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Part of the process is a direction—that is in the clause that we are debating. My point is that the direction should not require the parties to engage in mediation. Of course it should be possible to draw attention to the availability of mediation, and to encourage people by advising them that mediation might be the best, easiest and most natural way to begin progressing through the system, with the least controversy. However, in the end, if, in the judgment of the mediator or one of the parties, the process will not work, there should be no shred of coercion or other pressure to engage in mediation so as to go through the next stages of divorce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much confusion surrounds this issue. As was said in the previous debate, the dispute resolution service of family court welfare officers is often confused with mediation or conciliation. Judges often use the words "mediation" and "conciliation" when they ask court welfare officers to become involved with a problem within the framework of the court. I have already said to the hon. Member for Sherwood that I have seen many court welfare reports on children's interests. My concern is that a welfare officer's report may suggest something that is in the children's interests, but the same court does not have the power to insist that it is acted on if the two parents are still in dispute and seek to use the children as a pawn in their controversy. It may cause enormous distress to the children and the absent parent when the will of the court and the careful work of the court welfare service does not come to fruition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0145">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>249</span>
It is clear that such court reports are not the same as a mediation service offered by trained, independent family mediators. Many of them now work under arrangements with the probation service and referrals from the courts make up about 20 per cent. of the work of the independent family mediation system. Efforts are made to ensure that clients are clear in their own minds when they attend of their own accord, and they are not made to stay if, for any reason, they or the mediator consider that that is unsuitable for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 24 will give mediators the power to establish whether a case is suitable for mediation, but the point behind my amendments is that many judges are currently ordering mediation even though they have no such powers. Therefore, it would be clear in the Bill that voluntariness is the principle under which an order can be made, and that should be clearly understood by the legal profession, especially by judges. An order should not be made because that has to be done, but should be made within the principle of voluntariness of the parties involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make the Bill work better. Many of us think that the principle of family mediation is a less aggressive and less controversial way for people who think that their relationship has come to an end to process their dealings with the least aggravation and without the backlash that is caused by controversy in the courts. I have focused my remarks on what I want the amendments to achieve. I present them on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I return to one of the criticisms of the Bill that I have already made more than once. In their present form, many of the Bill's provisions will be left to delegated legislation. However, I wish to make two points clear at the outset. First, delegated legislation is nothing unusual. Secondly, I appreciate that much of the working apparatus of the Bill will be piloted. Therefore, some delegated legislation is well nigh unavoidable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have discussed the Bill with many interested parties, and that criticism has been a common theme running through most discussions. Lawyers that I know have a healthy cynicism about subordinate legislation, and those with whom I have discussed the Bill were in favour of its broad thrust, but were concerned about core areas, such as information meetings and mediation. I am speaking in particular to my new clause 3. We do not know much about mediation from reading the Bill and it will be the subject of further Government deliberations which will be enforced by way of subordinate legislation.

We have heard at length about the Child Support Agency becoming involved. I see the Minister looking at me askance—I shall not talk about the CSA now—but it behoves us to obtain from him as much information about the nature of mediation as we can at this stage. That is right and proper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mediation is a welcome principle and it will help in due course to take away a great deal of the acrimony from divorces. I have already made my feelings known about the interjection of a representative for a child at that stage, and shall not go through them again. While I welcome the principle, the detail is lacking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>250</span>
The Bill contains a definition of mediation for the purposes of legal aid—it appears in clause 23(2) and (3)—but it is not exactly a paragon of clarity. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'Mediation' means mediation to which Part ILIA of this Act applies; and includes steps taken by a mediator in any case—

	<ol>

	<li>in determining whether to embark on mediation;</li>

	<li>in preparing for mediation; and</li>

	<li>in making any assessment under that Part."</li></ol></p></blockquote>

	<br><blockquote><p>"'mediator means a person with whom the Board contracts for the provision of mediation by any person.</p></blockquote>
That is typical parliamentary drafting, but it does not give any of us any considerable insight into what a mediator will do. We need further definition of what a mediator will be, who such people will be, what parameters they will work within and many other things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it would be better to start from the other end and say what mediation clearly is not. It is not conciliation. It is not reconciliation—an attempt to renew a relationship or to mend a marriage. As we know from our deliberations last week, it is not counselling. It is not legal representation and it is not the giving of legal advice or assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A definition could be that mediation is a process of assisted decision making. The definition favoured by the National Association of Family Mediation and Conciliation Services has already been given by the hon. Member for Broxtowe. The mediator has no stake in a dispute, is not identified with any of the competing interests and has no power to impose a settlement on the couple, who retain authority to make their own decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mediators work in the light of the Children Act 1989 which states that each parent shall have parental responsibility—even after divorce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The overwhelming majority of mediation is currently carried out by the NAFMCS and also by court welfare officers, who do a sterling job. Currently, court welfare officers deal mainly with child-centred mediation as part of the overall regular court process. Family mediators are recruited into local family mediation services from a range of professional backgrounds. Currently, just under half are family lawyers. They are selected, trained and supervised to an exacting standard. National core training consists of 30 days spread over six months and includes lectures, supervised practice, skills training and so on. After about 75 hours of face-to-face mediation with couples, mediators can be recommended for accreditation and membership of the new United Kingdom College of Family Mediators. There is much work to be done in bringing the proposals in this important part of the Bill into operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of what I might call mendable or savable marriages, it is true that couples rarely agree about ending the marriage. The first decision that they may make, therefore, is whether their marriage is over. If there is any uncertainty then, mediators refer them for counselling. That is good and proper, and I trust that that will be the procedure under the Bill. If, however, the marriage is over, the mediator invites them to negotiate about telling the children and how the children will continue their relationship with each parent. They will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0146">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>251</span>
discuss the house, pensions, cars and other assets, debts, loan repayments and so on. A discussion of financial support is very important, as is discussion of the presence of new partners, if that is relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout the mediation process, the mediator takes care to remain impartial as between the two parties, ensuring that negotiations are orderly and focused on the children and that full information is exchanged. If that involves financial information, it will include full disclosure and knowledge of it by the beloved CSA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mediator helps the parties to develop options that could resolve issues and to reach mutually agreed decisions that are then written down in a non legally binding summary. The process will involve hours of the painful and exacting use of skills. The mediator will need such skills to identify at intake those who should not be using the process because of a vista of domestic violence and, as the hon. Member for Broxtowe said, to ensure the voluntary participation of both partners. The mediator will need some qualification in and knowledge of managing stress and conflict and be able to redress power imbalances, which is very important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have mentioned at least once before that the Government have a substantial task to ensure that there is an adequate spread of available services. For example, I understand that six services are available in East Anglia, one in the north of Ireland and only two in north Wales. With fewer than a handful of trained mediators, there is a great deal to be achieved in a short time if the core of the Bill, which is laudable and of extreme importance, is to be implemented. To get up to speed, a lot of hard work will have to be done and resources will have to be found. Anyone who argues that the Bill is resource neutral is rather silly, because mediation will have to be brought up to speed, and common sense dictates that that will have resource implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the National Family Mediation Council, the services of 70 per cent. of all mediators were successful, in that agreements were reached. We all appreciate that agreements, to mean anything at all, must be voluntary. A further group of 11 per cent. of mediators said that issues had been clarified, but that disputes had not been resolved. Only 11 per cent. said that no benefit was derived from the process. We can safely say, therefore, that mediation is extremely useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The timing of referrals is crucial. The Bill could prove useful in increasing the success rate of mediation by ensuring an early referral to qualified mediators. That all-important body of people is described rather inelegantly in the House of Commons research document as the "central plank" of the Government's proposals. As yet, we do not know whether that central plank will
	<span class='label label-info column'>252</span>
be made of teak or of balsa wood. It is important for us to get some assurances about that, because so much revolves around it—even the very viability of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will know that in January a college of family mediators was initiated, under the chairmanship of no less an authority than Dame Margaret Booth, one of Her Majesty's justices in the family division. That is most welcome and, I believe, necessary. Can the Minister tell us when the Government intend to commit some financial input to the college, which could—and, I believe, will—soon have to become a guarantor of the standards of good practice in the vital service of mediation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to explore further the definition of mediation and the service that is to be provided. If nothing else, it gives us the opportunity to discuss an important part of the Bill. You referred, Mr. O'Hara, to the question of legal aid and availability, and I believe that I am right in thinking that we shall have a further opportunity to discuss those aspects, and the question of the statutory charge in particular, under clauses 23 and 24, so I shall not delay the Committee at this stage. I hope that I will be able to discuss those important matters later.

I am also concerned about the subject of mediation. It is entirely laudable to give people a chance to think it over—a year's delay—before a divorce, but I am concerned about the wording of clause 26, which says that mediation is
	<br><blockquote><p>"more appropriate than taking proceedings",</p></blockquote>
which is the current way of conducting a divorce case, in which either side is separately represented by a solicitor. Amendment No. 113 says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"no presumption shall be made that mediation is"</p></blockquote>
a superior way of handling the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mediation is the nouvelle cuisine of the Bill, the item that is different. We know that nouvelle cuisine is an apparently non-fattening method of preparing food which is usually not particularly nourishing. But most people prefer a good meal so would choose a la carte instead of the old table d'hôte if they have the opportunity to do so.

I seek much more detail from the Minister. It seems that we are losing the principle of free choice where individuals can decide and choose for themselves. Their right to choose the form of help they will proceed with after divorce should be enshrined in the Bill. Those who can afford it will do so automatically: they will go to a solicitor. By definition, when a person has reached the stage of filing for divorce, he needs someone to look after his interests at what, by that time, is an acrimonious stage. The wrangling over children and so on can leave one party disadvantaged if he is not well advised about the best personal deal available. Therefore, I am
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0147">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>253</span>
concerned that the Bill appears to direct on a particular path people who cannot afford to act privately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to know a great deal more about the mediation service because I have an antipathy towards new Government organisations, or quangos. Like mushrooms, they pop up all over the place, multiplying rapidly with underground runners. They begin, with the best will in the world, as semi-voluntary organisations and develop into quasi-professional ones. That may extend the cost of the Bill way beyond the intention that it be financially neutral: it was not supposed to cost more, and it was thought that it might even save a little.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I read my 
	<i>Daily Mail</i> or 
	<i>The Mail on Sunday</i> correctly, a leaked memorandum from the Lord Chancellor's Department admitted that the Bill will no longer be cost neutral. Bearing in mind the infant state of the mediation services, I doubt whether it was ever realistic to think that the Bill could be cost neutral. In fact, it adds three new services, not only the mediation service. There is the divorce information service, and another. I suggest to the Committee that the Bill, which deals at present with two services, is bound to add to costs, however much we pretend that that is unlikely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not naive about these matters. I know that divorce proceedings have become the new mini bonanza for many an average legal practice. Divorce has replaced conveyancing as the bread and butter of many a solicitor. The individual average cost per party to a divorce is about £1,500, which means £3,000 for a case to go through. A mediator, being one individual dealing with a divorce case, may seem like a bargain because he is only one person who, at current estimates, will cost about £750 for the couple.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But that supposes that mediation will resolve the matter and that the parties will not wish to consult solicitors although during, or at the end of, the process they may wish to switch. It seems much more appropriate that the Government, through their relationships with people responsible for legal aid, should attempt to cap the amount of money that solicitors receive for those divorce cases, because he who controls the purse strings can call the tune.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point, and I know that he has given much thought to the matter. As I say, I am proud of the fact that I am legally neutral, as it were, because I speak as a lay person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned, however, that the mediator will inevitably want a rate of pay similar to that of the solicitor. The mediator will not be there to give advice, as the solicitor would be, but will just have to be neutral and guide people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A smart individual might go to a solicitor before going to the mediator and find out the best ways to argue his or her case—usually his case. He might then approach the mediator and manage to work the situation to his advantage. The mediator, who might well be aware of what is going on, will not be able to say anything about it, because he or she has to be neutral. That could put one or other of the parties—again, usually the woman—at a disadvantage. Unless someone is clueing one in, how is one to know what one's best interests are when the mediator, sitting there as the pig in the middle, is not allowed to say? That worries me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have known women whose interests have been ill served, simply because they did not realise the significance of the value of the husband's business, for example. They knew that the husband had a business and that that was how he made his money, but they never thought of that business as anything to do with them, and calmly agreed that the business should be left to the husband. Women have walked away from that opportunity simply out of ignorance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such issues concern me, and make me want to know a great deal more about mediation and what the alternatives are for controlling the cost of the Bill. I am aware that the cost of legal aid is rocketing and that about one fifth of the whole budget is spent on divorce proceedings: in 1990, the amount spent was £87 million, and the current figure is about £300 million. The Government have a duty to ensure that divorce will not gobble up
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0148">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>255</span>
most of the budget and that the Bill will not exert excessive pressure for yet more spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to the remarks of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, who called for more resources for the mediation services, to implement training and so on. It worries me that mediators seem to be generating their own criteria. What is the intellectual basis for mediation? What is the intellectual input into their training? What is the ethical position of mediators? What is their code of practice? Who decides those things?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legal profession, for all its faults—certainly, cost is one of its major faults—relies on a tradition of law in handling such matters. It also has a code of ethics in relation to the client; naturally, in this case, it is to get the best possible arrangement for the client and the children. However, I am not aware of how those conditions apply to the mediators. It is extremely important that those least able to assess the relevant values of the services on offer should not be pushed in the least costly direction. Of course, the least costly can still be good value for money. I wait to hear what my hon. Friend the Minister has to say on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mean no disrespect to my male colleagues, but it is often the woman who is less financially aware; she often has had little to do with the family finances. It is important that both partners should be properly advised, especially as it is likely that the woman will be caring for the children. Although subsection (4)(b) uses the words "more appropriate", that may be translated in the public mind into a mandatory provision—"This is how we do it". Someone not smart enough to say, "I am going to the solicitor to find out the pros and cons" may, through the advisory services—perhaps the divorce information services—be edged in that direction. I do not want people who are less aware of the options open to them to get a bad deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been told more than once of the great shortage of mediators. We were told that Bristol has 12 mediators, although 200 family solicitors are available to undertake divorce and other related proceedings. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy mentioned that only two mediators are available in Wales. It is an enormous job to produce enough people, properly trained and qualified, to deal with the problem. It cannot be done overnight. One cannot advertise in the newspapers for mediators to come forward for training if they have no legal background. I see the merits of solicitors being mediators, because they at least have the necessary legal background. However, I repeat that solicitors are not supposed to give advice, which is an extraordinary state of affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's presumption in favour of mediation is misplaced. At best it is idealistic. At worst, it is naive. We are rushing ahead, yet we shall need many new people to do a sensitive job in a situation that can lead to much unhappiness—one that may involve children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Child Support Agency was started, we had to find and employ 7,000 operators—an enormous number of people. We all know what problems that led to in the first two years of its operation. I am a great supporter of the CSA and I do not believe in single mother families. All families have fathers. I believe that who-
	<span class='label label-info column'>256</span>
ever fathered the children should pay for their upkeep. I support the concept of the Child Support Agency, but we know the awful consequences of putting together such a mammoth operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have the figures in front of me showing how many people enter divorce proceedings each year but, given the amount of money involved, it seems that it could be a hornet's nest of disputes and difficulties. The Government, rightly, wish to see a reduction in cost, but I think that the service should be considered again with a view to making it more realistic. Giving advice is an essential part of the service and to remain neutral and simply guide people while they sort out their problems seems unrealistic, given what I know about people who go through divorce proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I never have dealt with such matters in court, but such a direction may be premature. It needs a great deal more thinking out and, until that happens, we should remove from the Bill the extremely firm direction that the service—unproven, almost unestablished—provided by relatively unqualified people should be deemed "more appropriate". If the Government can reassure me about that and will take the opportunity at a later stage to strengthen their hand on the matter, I would feel much more comfortable about supporting such a proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important debate because we have reached the stage when we must put under scrutiny what has been described as the central plank of the Government's Bill, and we must remember that it is the Government's Bill. Time and again, my concern returns to its practicality and to the extent to which it has been thought through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It beggars belief that the Government, during their consideration of such measures and their consultation process, have not arrived at a definition of mediation that is acceptable to the mediators who will have to play a major part in the reform that the Government have instigated. Referring to the definition, National Family Mediation which, after all, is the main provider of out-of-court family mediation in England and Wales said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"this is an inadequate definition of a mediator, and fails to reflect either the existing level of professional accountability of the mediation services or that being established by means of the UK College of Mediators".</p></blockquote>
We have heard about the United Kingdom College of Family Mediators from the hon. Member for Broxtowe, whose amendments have a great deal to commend them. It is incredible that the Department has not arrived at a satisfactory definition; the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman) in that regard seem entirely justified. We need to examine what we are creating. There are times when we think of the Bill as a sort of matrimonial Frankenstein. It comprises a number of parts that have been grafted together, which are all too often ill-matched and half prepared. It is as if the vat were never brought properly to the boil before the limb was extracted from it.

We intend to tease out from the Minister exactly what he has in mind. We also intend to lay a proper, workable framework for mediation to ensure that the mediation services provided by the Bill are of the highest quality and remain accountable to Parliament, through the Lord Chancellor's Department, not least because of the sums of money needed for the infrastructure. I am going to be tiresome but make no apology for that. When discussing the expenditure of public moneys, we are right to be tiresome in demanding of the Minister how much it will cost to prime the pump to establish the infrastructure for mediation. How much will it cost? I have asked the question twice. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Stockton, South is not a source from which I expect the answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I want, what the Committee wants, and what the hon. Member for Billericay puts a practised finger on is to be told how the mediation service will be paid for. Some sums must have been done and we shall go on and on until those figures are made public. Any notion that the Bill is cost neutral has now been utterly exploded, as the hon. Member for Billericay said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had not intended to intrude on private grief during this debate, despite being urged to do so. However, the hon. Member for Billericay has set the hare running, and I see no reason why I should not give chase. She referred to reports of a certain memorandum in Sunday's newspapers. The report was drawn to my attention between the Shredded Wheat and the baked beans and it caused me to splutter I wonder what effect it had on the Minister, although he already knew of the contents of the memorandum that inspired the headline, "Whitehall in revolt over political spin". That was enough to grab the attention of the person who drew it to my attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report referred to a memorandum—perhaps the Minister will tell us about his knowledge of it—from Mr. William Arnold, who is a grade 5 assistant secretary at
	<span class='label label-info column'>258</span>
the Lord Chancellor's Department. Anthony Bevins wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The hapless Mr. Arnold is in the firing line because he has been landed with the mess of divorce reform through the Family Law Bill."</p></blockquote>
We sympathise with Mr. Arnold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The memorandum makes it absolutely clear that the problem which has arisen in the Lord Chancellor's Department has caused a spin so serious and grave that Mr. Arnold felt it necessary to warn the Prime Minister's office of its consequences. That spin has been caused by the collapse of any pretence that the Bill is cost neutral. As a result of that leaked memorandum, it is clear that the Treasury must have been led to believe initially that the costs of the Bill could be contained within the existing budget. Figures must have been produced to have led the Treasury to that conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear the Minister say from a sedentary position that it was compulsory.

Would the Minister like to confirm that? 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> From a sedentary position, there has been an indication that reconciliation was attempted. However, it was not achieved because the figures are not reconciliable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is impossible to reconcile the expenditure that will be necessary to establish a proper infrastructure for mediation with the idea that the Bill is cost neutral, unless it is intended to remove public assistance from elsewhere. We shall deal with that matter in due course when we speak to amendments on legal aid. The two matters are irreconcilable unless it is intended to deprive a further section of the public of access to legal advice, assistance and representation. In that case, it might be possible to square the circle. However, time and again, the Government have denied that.

Our amendments would ensure that the public were assured that the mediators to whom couples took marriages in crisis with the hope of finding agreement were properly accredited and qualified to provide mediation services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings us to the state of determining exactly what is offered. The hon. Members for Broxtowe, for Billericay and for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy gave the Committee some idea of that. The process does not have justice at its heart, but a settlement that is likely to be sustainable. That is different from justice. The parties to a marriage that has broken down are entitled to

The basis of law, to which we are committed, and the rule of law, which is entitled to be applied as much to private as to public relations, show the notion that married parties are not entitled to justice when their marriage dissolves to be false and specious. The notion that by entering into a marriage contract the parties submit to a process that denies them justice at its dissolution is abhorrent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments that we are considering, whether tabled by me, my hon. Friends or Conservative Members, all try to create a context in which there is a genuine choice between court-based solutions and mediation, in which there is an important possibility of moving from mediation to obtaining legal advice, assistance and, if necessary, representation, and back to mediation. The experience of family mediation in Australia and elsewhere indicates that this is a perfectly sound and desirable approach. Yes indeed, mediation is a service that is available. It has a role to play. It is, to use a term that I hope will be attractive to hon. Members on both sides, there within the market place. One can buy into mediation and, equally, one can buy into legal advice, assistance and representation as and when appropriate. Those who, because of their financial position, cannot buy into that process and are eligible have legal aid to enable them to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be a genuine market in this service. The purpose of the information session is to inform the parties of the nature of that market and what it holds out. It should not be to drive people particularly those who are publicity assisted along a certain path. The hon. Member for Billericay was right to put her finger on that. The wealthy will always be able to do what best suits them as they see it. It is quite wrong to say that because someone is eligible for legal aid he must go down one course and that someone who is not can do as he pleases.

What is to happen when one party to a marriage is entitled to legal aid and the other party is not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Jim Lester</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is invariably the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is indeed. I am not clear now that issue is properly addressed in the Bill, at least in a way that is likely to promote justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Australia, mediation and conciliation services which, has been correctly pointed out, are different, are offered in a number of ways. They are offered through community schemes, services attached to marriage guidance centres and private practitioners within the court process. I look forward to a time when solicitors themselves are able to offer with their practices access to mediators, not necessarily even solicitor mediators. That ought to be possible. Indeed, some progressive firms are already gearing themselves up to having mediators within the firm and thus to offer counselling services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are not hostile towards and indeed support the notion of choice—but is must be a genuine
	<span class='label label-info column'>260</span>
choice. I am not convinced that as matters stand that is the case. We are anxious to ensure that the Bill is amended so that that may happen. We are anxious to ensure that the issue of empowerment and control is genuinely addressed. Control and choice are matters that all too often, in the context of crisis in a marriage, may be available to one party but are denied to the other. That sows the seeds of injustice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are determined that we should not concede justice in the course of our deliberations on the Bill. We look to the Minister for a reassurance along those lines. We look for the clearest possible indication from the Government that they accept the principle of a genuinely level playing field between mediation and court-based, lawyer-based solutions and services. If they cannot give us that assurance, we will have no option but to support any selected amendment that will achieve that end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much agree with what my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe said when moving his amendment, which is that the voluntary principle is essential for mediation to succeed. It is likely to succeed only if both parties are committed to it. It is not appropriate in cases where there is an extreme imbalance of power or finance between the parties, where there is violence between the parties or in cases of extreme disagreement or antagonism. If mediation is to work, there must be no pressure to engage in it. There must be no pressure to engage in mediation to allow the divorce to proceed. It is important that the Bill include the voluntary principle and not provide for a court order to require people to engage in mediation against their will. My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe made all those points well, and I fully agree with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 12 gives the court the power to direct the parties to attend a meeting at which mediation services are explained and made available. Perhaps the Minister can reassure me on this point, but at face value, it seems to me that clause 12 almost compels people to take part in mediation. Although it stops short of compelling both parties to attend the same meeting, it comes close to compulsory mediation. In practice, compulsory mediation will be the effect, especially when clause 12 is taken with clause 26 where legal aid is deemed more appropriate for mediation than legal representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent quoted the proverb, "You can take a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink." It seems that the Lord Chancellor's Department has managed to rewrite the proverb—"You can take a horse to water and you can make it drink." That will be the result of clause 12 unless it is amended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clauses 12 and 26 are attempts—some might even argue crude attempts—to manipulate people into mediation. Under subsections (2) and (3) the court can use its powers at any time on application by a party or on its own initiative. To be fair, subsection (4) provides that both parties need not attend the same meeting if that is their wish, or if the court believes that a joint meeting is inappropriate. Subsection (5) provides for the court to be told whether the parties have agreed to take part in mediation. I suggest that the court would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0151">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>261</span>
not look kindly on a party who refused to take part in mediation. Perhaps that would be viewed by the court as obstruction, thus allowing the court to make the divorce order under schedule 1, even though the arrangements for the future had not been settled. In practice, even where one party has strong reservations, the pressure to take part in mediation will be overwhelming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Minister told me on many occasions, both in the Committee and in our discussions, compulsory reconciliation or compulsory marriage guidance simply do not work. Surely the same argument applies to compulsory mediation. Indeed, it is a contradiction in terms. Mediation and manipulation are contradictory terms. As we know, the Bill permits unilateral no-fault divorce on demand. One party can want a divorce and the law will ensure that he or she always gets that divorce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one has yet proposed that judges should be given the powers to split up marriages on the court's initiative, but under this clause and other measures in the Bill, there is a clear danger that the court can use coercion to bring about a divorce settlement through mediation. It is one thing to say that, without arrangements for the future, one cannot get a divorce; it is quite another for the state to manipulate people into making a divorce settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the manipulation in clause 12 is in stark contrast to what the Minister said in reply to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Brent, South, which would require people to attend a compulsory marriage guidance meeting. The hon. Gentleman argued that that would mean only one meeting and that it did not compel people to engage in marriage counselling, but the Minister said that to force people to attend just one information meeting would be to effect compulsory marriage guidance. That, however, is precisely what the Bill does in providing for compulsory attendance at an initial mediation meeting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, my hon. Friend the Minister will argue that people who do not want to go on to further mediation can take another route, or take on a lawyer. Effectively, however, they would have been pushed strongly in the direction of mediation. The amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe is very important for those reasons. I hope that the Minister will feel able to accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay are also important. Clause 26 deems mediation to be "more appropriate" for legal aid than is taking proceedings. The amendments remove the presumption in favour of legal aid for mediation rather than court proceedings. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will accept the amendments, which would put mediation and legal representation on the same footing. That is entirely fair. People should have a choice. That is what a free country is about. A Conservative Government should not be forcing people into mediation. As my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay said, we are setting up a new, state-funded quango and we should ask whether that is the way to proceed. How can mediation be more appropriate than legal proceedings
	<span class='label label-info column'>262</span>
in cases that involve domestic violence or extreme antagonism?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mediators cannot, by definition, give legal advice, as they are not qualified. There is a severe shortage of mediators. The hon. Member for the unpronounceable place in Wales—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can pronounce the hon. Gentleman's constituency. Why cannot he pronounce mine? Is he ill-educated? What is his problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. How about Meirionnydd Nant Conwy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not want to make a fool of myself. I am glad to have acquitted myself on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman told us that there are only eight to 12 mediators in his county. During an hour-long session with the Solicitors Family Law Association, I was told that there are perhaps only 200 mediators in the country able to deal with financial matters. Many more mediators might be able to deal with disputes over children, but there is an extreme shortage of those able to deal with financial matters, which can be extremely complicated in divorce settlements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Training for mediators is very much shorter than training for lawyers. A trained lawyer can become a mediator with as little as eight days' training. Non-lawyers might take longer obviously. We have a large number of lawyers with law degrees and years of training, but the Bill—without any costing or any attempt to tell us how many mediators are available—gives a clear presumption on legal aid and a clear signposting that people should go to mediation rather than the large number of experienced family solicitors. That is extraordinary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, we welcome the Bill's increased emphasis on mediation. If people can deal with divorce through mediation, all to the good—no one denies that—but we should surely adopt an evolutionary approach. Gradually, over the years, the number of qualified mediators will build, people will acquire more confidence in proceeding in that way and the system will improve so that we save money on the legal aid bill. As with so many other measures in the past, there is an attempt to pile everything into this one Bill. No-fault divorce, an entirely new mechanism, is being introduced, and there is another new mechanism which almost forces people to take the mediation route. This could be a disaster—we could be embarking on a dangerous set of affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has become almost a cliché to say that the Bill could be another Child Support Agency Bill. I hesitate to say so again, but it is a serious point. I do not see why the Bill should not introduce the concept of mediation. It is a very good concept, for which legal aid should be available, but people should not be compelled to undergo it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have great sympathy with the proposition that we should not compel people to undergo
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0152">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>263</span>
mediation, for all the reasons that my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe has given. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle should be wary of suggesting that there is something inevitably superior in the existing conflict situation, in which people go to different solicitors and the presupposition is that the two solicitors will be locked in combat. That is one of the most damaging features of the present situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. If people can sort out their divorce arrangements through mediation, that is a very satisfactory way of proceeding. There is no argument about that. However, in cases of domestic violence or when there is a great imbalance of power, it may be more appropriate for people to go to a lawyer. One party—often the man—may have greater resources than the woman and will consider it essential to employ a solicitor, as his future and his property are at stake. He will employ a solicitor from the word go but, as I understand the Bill, the woman will not necessarily be able to do the same but will have to go down the mediation route. That cannot be right. If the Minister can reassure me on that point, that will be a step forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Jim Lester</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the whole purpose of mediation is that it involves both parties. We cannot have one party going to a mediator and the other going to a solicitor. If one party goes to a solicitor, that rules out mediation immediately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand the either/or argument. I have always understood that mediation is part of a more civilised process than the one we have at present. Legal aid, presumably, goes all the way through the system. It enables someone to pay a mediator—which cannot be done until we change the law—but it can subsequently be used for a solicitor. I am not sure where this argument is going. It is taking us away from the central point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If what my hon. Friend says is right, that is reassuring. We are all agreed on what we want to achieve in the Bill. We are arguing about something that my hon. Friend's amendments are trying to make clear in the Bill, and which my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay has also tried to make clear in the Bill. When people decide that they want to divorce, and one party files a statement of marital breakdown, they should have a clear choice. Do they want to proceed with mediation, which in many cases may be appropriate, or do they want to hire a lawyer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard much during our proceedings about the value of mediation, but the research paper issued by the House of Commons Library gives some interesting information. According to the chairman of the Solicitors Family Law Association:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The research to date has been limited and evaluative rather than comparative. The Government relied heavily on research undertaken by the Joseph Rowntree Association into five pilot projects run by National Family Mediation, but this was based on questionnaires returned by only 54 users of all-issues mediation. The group was by definition self-selecting and nearly all had access to their own solicitors during mediation. Even then, 20 per cent. failed to reach agreement on any issues and only 39 per cent. agreed everything. The SFLA wanted to inform its response to the divorce reform proposals by seeking the views of our clients and in the summer of 1995 members
	<span class='label label-info column'>264</span>
were asked to send questionnaires to the ten clients to whom they next happened to write. The responses went to a central point and the results were analysed. Forty-eight per cent. said they would not feel comfortable mediating and less than one-third thought that the issues could be resolved amicably through a mediator. Thirteen per cent. cited domestic violence as a concern. Seventy-seven per cent. said that if they were to mediate they would want access to their own solicitor throughout the process. These views were not expressed out of ignorance about mediation. Eighty per cent. correctly defined mediation when given a range of options, before being given a proper definition for the purposes of the rest of the survey."</p></blockquote>
The important point in this account, on which I end my remarks, is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The findings support the view that mediation is probably suitable for at best 30/40 per cent. divorcing population."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the premise on which the hon. Gentleman has based his remarks about mediation being compulsory is right. Perhaps I may direct him to the first line of clause 12, which provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"After the court has received a statement, it may give a direction".</p></blockquote>
It does not say that it shall do so. If that were the wording the hon. Gentleman would be right, but the use of the word "may" means that the court can give the direction if it thinks it appropriate. In instances in which violence was involved, it would clearly be impossible to consider mediation. My contention is that the question is not one of compulsory mediation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who represents Meirionnydd Nant Conwy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister can reassure us. All I can say is that those who advise me believe that while the Bill may not provide for compulsion, it is drafted in such a way that people who may not clearly understand the legal system will be under encouragement, so powerful that it is tantamout to compulsion, to attend mediation—my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay has made that point. If my hon. Friend the Minister can reassure us on the point, it is all to the good. The courts, of course, can now take cognisance of what a Minister says on the Floor of the House. Courts can refer to 
	<i>Hansard.</i> It would be helpful if my hon. Friend would make it clear that there will be no compulsion to engage in mediation; that from the beginning of the process—the information meeting—it would be made clear to people that if they felt that antagonism or violence or other such issues needed to be discussed, they would be entitled to brief a lawyer from the word go. Such an assurance would be very useful and set many concerns at rest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful to say something about the effect of the amendments and to deal in detail with remarks that have been made by my hon. Friends and other hon. Members who have contributed to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 112, 113 and 114 relate to clause 26, which would insert a new subsection (3F) into section 15 of the Legal Aid Act 1988. The new subsection states that when a determination is made whether to grant legal representation in family matters, mediation is to be considered more appropriate than taking pro-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0153">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>265</span>
ceedings, except in the case of prescribed circumstances or types of proceedings laid down in regulations made by the Lord Chancellor or in cases where a mediator has certified that mediation does not appear to be suitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should make it clear that the provision would apply to the formulation of a decision about whether to grant legal representation in family matters. I have suggested on the Floor of the House and in Committee on previous occasions that it is the Government's intention that people should have access to legal advice through the process that will be established. Therefore, I should endeavour to ensure that in those cases that arise from time to time, of which we have heard, in which one party has taken legal advice, it would be the case that the Legal Aid Act would be used to ensure that legal advice would be available to the other party as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can people come to an agreed solution within a process of mediation other than in circumstances in which advice is available? Some sections of the legal profession have claimed that that should be extended to legal representation as well. However, it would make a nonsense of seeking to reach a mediated solution if the parties were legally represented before a mediator. The mediator does not engage in arbitrating between them, but seeks to reach an agreed solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 36 is intended to operate as a rebuttable presumption in favour of mediation. I should make it clear that the presumption may be rebutted in certain types of cases or may be rebutted on evidence being produced that the presumption should be rebutted in certain circumstances. I wish to highlight the fact that it is intended that the type of cases where the presumption automatically would be rebutted—cases in which there would be no requirement even to attend a mediator at any point—would be those public law cases under the Children Act 1989 or cases where the parties were applying for protection measures against domestic violence under part IV of the Act. I hope that that deals with some of the points made during the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also made it clear that the Lord Chancellor's Department will be engaged in widespread consultation within the context of the advisory board that will be established. As a result of that, I envisage that other categories may fall with those receiving automatic presumption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious that we should consult further about which proceedings might be included in regulations. We are learning more about mediation; it is not a new concept about which we know nothing. It has been a means of dispute resolution for a number of years. Some members of the Committee have widespread experience of that in practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree with Dr. Shelley Day Sclater of the University of East London, who concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We remain woefully ignorant about the details of mediation processes, about what actually happens in the room between mediators and their clients. Even within single service, the ideologies and practices of the mediators may vary widely, but firm evidence of the nature and consequences of such differences is lacking."</p></blockquote>
Does the hon. Gentleman share my desire that we should address the issue of differing ideologies and
	<span class='label label-info column'>266</span>
practices? If we do not, is there not a danger that mediation will not hold out the benefits that all us wish it to?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly do not recognise the slightly sinister note that that intervention carried it. It has been stressed that there are few mediators—someone suggested that there are only 200—but National Family Mediation has 700 working in 66 centres and 450 mediators work with the Family Mediator Association. That makes a total of 1,150 mediators who are working at this time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Brent, South is making the point that we should have more information about the processes involved mediation, I am sure that the arrangement made for grant aiding research and for the advisory committee that is being set up to undertake the operation of the Bill will take into account the way in which the processes operate in practice. The claim that none of us knows what is going on in the work of National Family Mediation and the Family Mediation Association is wide of the mark. Those two bodies contribute to the College of Mediators that was set up earlier in the year, and which was quoted with approval by Opposition Members. It was cited in the context of the criticism of the Government that the Bill does not contain a definition of mediation and that in some sense we should be restricting a definition. While I acknowledge that National Family Mediation and the Family Mediators Association, as members of the college, are driving that point, I am anxious that we do not adopt too restrictive an approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very much aware of the valid point that was made by the hon. Member for Motherwell, South (Dr. Bray), which he argued with some force. Some of my hon. Friends also say that we should not restrict ourselves just to those organisations and that there might be other people who can offer mediation services. The Government envisage that that should be undertaken through a code of practice set by the Lord Chancellor's Department and, subsequently, by contracts made by the Legal Aid Board with the individual organisations that are offering mediation services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would argue that that addresses many of the points that have been raised. However I return to the presumption, because it is at the core of the concerns of my hon. Friends and I want to reassure them. It would be helpful if I said how the presumption is intended to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make clear to the Committee that the presumption does not compel parties to mediate. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle mentioned the authority of Pepper 
	<i>v.</i> Hart and said that remarks made by Ministers in these circumstances carried a certain amount of provenance. I repeat that the presumption does not compel parties to mediate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is assumed that a party requiring legal representation might first approach a solicitor. A solicitor would establish whether the case fell into one of the prescribed categories of proceedings that would automatically rebut the presumption. I have said what some of those cases might be—public law Children Act 1989 cases, applications for protection measures against domestic violence or any others that might come forward as part of the process to which I referred earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0154">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>267</span>
If a case falls into that prescribed category, the solicitor can apply to the Legal Aid Board for a certificate for representation certifying that the case is indeed in that category. I again make the point that legal aid would still be available, even through that period, for advice. We are talking about the application being made for a certificate for representation, because in the circumstances to which I have referred mediation might not be an appropriate option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a case did not fall within a prescribed category, the presumption could be rebutted only in prescribed circumstances. The Bill makes it clear that one of those circumstances will be that the mediator has certified that the parties were unsuitable and that the case was inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have noted the observations of my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe in that regard, whose remarks were quoted with approval by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle. I, too, quote them with approval. My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe said that mediation should be made to work where that was possible, but that couples must be committed to the process. He said that it would not be suited to everyone and that we must ensure that both parties were prepared to work at it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle that my hon. Friend quoted was one of voluntariness, which is in the National Family Mediation code of practice—it is one of its core principles. I referred earlier to the code of practice that will be set by the Lord Chancellor's Department to deal with the way in which mediators operate. Clause 24 sets out the principles that must be incorporated as principles of practice in the contracts that will be granted for mediation services by the Legal Aid Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I understand that my hon. Friends would like that to be in the Bill, my current advice is that it is inappropriate for it to be in primary legislation. I rely substantially on the correct assertion of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle that observations made by Ministers in this regard are of key importance. I hope that the approval that I have given to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe will be taken as some degree of assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Jim Lester</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to be clear that what my hon. Friend is saying is that there will be an indirect system of assurance and that, because it is in the code of practice of National Family Mediation, it is therefore likely to be in the Lord Chancellor's code of practice, and that indirectly makes it clear beyond peradventure that voluntarism is beyond question and that there will be no compulsion. Is that my hon. Friend's argument?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope to be even more reassuring to my hon. Friend because I shall now deal specifically with what will happen when people are invited to see a mediator. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent gave the example of taking a horse to water but not being able to make it drink. In practice, it is not uncommon for parties to say no to mediation, even if they are asked in very general terms by a solicitor in whom the client has confidence. Once the parties have met the mediator and discussed what is involved and what its benefits might be, they often change their minds and become willing to try one or two sessions, assuming that
	<span class='label label-info column'>268</span>
the other partner is also willing. If, despite such a meeting, the parties remain unconvinced, they will at least have been made aware of mediation and be taking an informed decision not to attend. It is important that parties fully understand mediation and how it might help them. The object, therefore, of a suitability assessment is to enable clients, in consultation with the mediator, to take an informed decision about the right course of action for them, but not, I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe, to force them into mediation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is quite clearly saying that people will not be forced into mediation and that is very satisfactory. If that is made so clear in the Bill, why does the Solicitors Family Law Association, which supports mediation and the Bill, say that, as drafted,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the proposed addition to the Legal Aid Act 1988 would, in effect, make mediation compulsory for those eligible for legal aid"?</p></blockquote>
One must ask whether it is really wrong in the light of clause 26. It is not clause 12 that will compel people to go into mediation, but the combination of clauses 12 and 26, and the presumption in clause 26 that will effectively direct everyone, unless they are careful, to mediation. That is what worries me and the Solicitors Family Law Association, which supports the Bill. That is why we need the Minister's reassurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have difficulty in explaining the position of the Solicitors Family Law Association as I disagree with its view. However, I am mindful of the Law Society's statement yesterday that some 80 per cent. of people in these circumstances were in favour having access to legal advice. That was quoted by the Law Society as a reason why the Government's proposals are wrong. If someone had asked me that question, I would have been in the 80 per cent. category. I hope that I have reassured the Committee that it is the Government's intention to ensure that parties in such circumstances have access to legal advice. I bear in mind that the Solicitors Family Law Association is heavily engaged in promoting mediation, not least its own services. I am aware that some members of the organisation have trained to offer mediation services. I dare say that there will be a considerable expansion of the availability of mediation services from members of the Solicitors Family Law Association and other practitioners in that branch of the law who will offer such services.

I have said that a person is unsuitable for mediation if, having attended mediation, he or she or the other party involved is not inclined to proceed with that means of resolving matters. By highlighting the voluntary principle in that regard I emphasise that there is not much that divides us in the debate.
