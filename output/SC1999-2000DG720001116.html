	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Hugh Bayley)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Social Security (Incapacity Benefit) Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations 2000.</p></blockquote>
You are an experienced Committee Chairman, Dr. Kumar, but this is the first time that I have had the pleasure of serving under your guidance and I am pleased that you are part of the Speaker's Panel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations form part of the Government's strategy to modernise incapacity benefit. In the last two decades of the 20th century, there was a threefold increase in the number of people claiming incapacity benefit; in 1979 the figure was about 600,000, but now it is 1.6 million, and it is more than 2 million if all the incapacity benefit claimants—those on income support receiving the full range of incapacity benefits—are included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The health of the population of working age improved in that 20-year period and that is why the Government introduced the modernisation plans. Some of those who claim incapacity benefit clearly cannot work, and it is important for the Government to provide security for such people through the benefits system. However, others can work; indeed, the Government's labour force survey reports that some 1 million people currently on incapacity benefit say that they wish that they were able to work—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the Minister that I am not being querulous, but I should like him to make it clear that the Government do not intend to compel to work those who are genuinely incapable of doing so on a long-term basis. Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that those people will be protected?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman had shown a little more patience he would have heard me talk about the new deal for disabled people, which was a great success in its pilot phase. On Monday, we set up plans to roll out the new deal as a national scheme, on the same basis as the pilot, to help people on incapacity benefit who choose to work. Compulsion does not come into it. That has never been the case and those who suggest that it is have misled and alarmed people on incapacity benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The difference between this Government's policy and that of our predecessor, is that the previous Government accepted that it was the natural order of things that 1.6 million people should be parked on incapacity benefit, that high unemployment was to be expected and that there was no realistic prospect of such people returning to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of those people sought to return to work, although in many cases they faced formidable obstacles in order to do so. The Government have a responsibility, which we discharge through reform of the benefits and tax systems, the introduction of the minimum wage and measures to make work pay, and an obligation to remove the poverty trap and the barriers in the benefits system that prevent those who want to work going into the labour market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, for a significant number of people work is simply not an option, and the Government are doing more to help the poorest and most severely disabled people who cannot work. The regulations will help those people by the provision of incapacity benefit for people disabled early in life who have never had the opportunity to earn, and who in the past would have claimed severe disablement allowance. They will now be able to claim incapacity benefit, and will be some £26 a week better off as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, we also announced a further improvement to the disability income guarantee, which will come into effect in April next year. When we initially proposed it in our Green Paper on disability benefits, we were talking about providing an additional premium within income support for severely disabled people of £5.75 a week for a single person, which would have raised the overall benefit package under the disability income guarantee to £128 a week. After last week's announcement, those people will receive not £128, but £142 a week when the disability income guarantee comes into effect in April next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time last week we announced our intention to increase the disabled child premium within income support. We intend to raise it, in April next year, from the current rate of £22.25 a week to £30 a week—a real increase of £7.40 a week for families with disabled children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also announced substantial improvements for carers. For those carers who cannot work and are on the lowest incomes there will be a £10 increase in the carer premium. We will introduce an eight-week run-on period for carers who face bereavement on the death of the person for whom they cared, for which the Carers National Association has campaigned for a long time. For those who are able to combine the high level of caring that entitles them to invalid carers allowance with employment, we have increased the earnings limit so that they can earn more before losing that allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those measures will increase Government spending on disability benefits for next year by £200 million a year, and over the period 2001–04 they will account for £750 million of additional expenditure on benefits for disabled people and carers. That is far more than the changes to incapacity benefit that we are discussing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0157">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
today will save. The measures have not been introduced to cut costs, but as part of a modernisation programme to create conditions that will make it possible to give support to the most severely disabled people, while helping those who are on incapacity benefits but want to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government listened carefully to the concerns that were raised during the passage of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999, and the regulations deal with many of them. The regulations seek to amend the Social Security (Incapacity Benefit) Regulations 1994, and also make some minor amendments to the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987, the Social Security (Credits) Regulations 1975 and the Social Security (Payments on Account, Overpayments and Recovery) Regulations 1988. I do not intend to go through the regulations one by one, unless the Committee encourages me to do so, but I will concentrate instead on the more important changes being proposed to the incapacity benefit regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are making amendments in three principal areas. First, the national insurance contribution conditions for new claims are being changed. Secondly, occupational and personal pension income in excess of £85 a week will be taken into account for new claims from April 2001. Thirdly, incapacity benefit will be extended to long-term incapacitated young people aged 16 to 19, and in some circumstances to those aged under 25. I must stress that all our proposals apply only to new claims made after 6 April 2001, and that existing beneficiaries, at the point of change, will not be affected by the measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations amend the contribution conditions for incapacity benefit so that only people who have paid contributions in one of the three tax years prior to the claim will qualify. Nevertheless, we recognise that there are situations where it is unreasonable to expect people to have worked and contributed during the past three tax years. The regulations, therefore, provide that carers who currently qualify for incapacity benefit after receiving invalid care allowance will be able to continue to do so on the same basis as now—that is, through contributions paid in any tax year. I should emphasise that it will not be necessary for the person to have been working immediately before they started caring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Special protection is also being provided to people receiving the disabled persons tax credit who earn below the lower earnings limit, so that they can re-qualify for incapacity benefit beyond the normal linking rules. People on the credit are already helped by a special two-year linking rule in incapacity benefit that allows them to return to benefit at the same point at which they left it. However, we recognise that such people could be disadvantaged if they stayed in work for more than two years. Consequently, the regulations provide that a person in that position can re-qualify for incapacity benefit as now, on the basis of contributions paid in any tax year rather than in one of the most recent three.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Bermingham 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(St. Helens, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister can probably anticipate what I am about to ask, as I have written to him concerning this growing problem. I welcome the fact that pensions can now be discounted for incapacity benefit purposes. However, there has been a change in how local authority councillors are paid, and they now receive an annual fee rather than an attendance allowance. Why are those councillors in receipt of incapacity benefit now doubly penalised by the reduction of incapacity benefit in other benefit situations? They have to pay income tax and stamps on their council allowances. Why cannot steps be taken to correct that anomaly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question has been brought to my attention by my hon. Friend and other hon. Members. As a result of representations made to me, new regulations were published some months ago to restore the link—doing so seemed simple and straightforward—between the councillors' allowance limit in incapacity benefit and the therapeutic earnings limit, which had been broken a year or so before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a more favourable regime for councillors than applies to anyone else on incapacity benefit in relation to earnings. Someone who has received incapacity benefit and worked under the therapeutic earnings limit will forgo his ability to claim incapacity benefit once he has gone over the limit. We recognise councillors' special position, and we would not want to provide a bar to prevent people from seeking election to represent their community on a local authority. Councillors can therefore retain their incapacity benefit and yet earn more than the therapeutic earnings limit, although they lose, pound for pound, penny for penny, what they receive in councillors' allowances in addition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no reason why councillors should be worse off because of the changes, although certain councillors who have preserved rights and receive incapacity benefit on the basis of a previous claim to invalidity benefit have seen a change in their tax rules. Every person moved from invalidity benefit to incapacity benefit faces that change. I am not convinced that it would be fair to give a tax advantage to members of local authorities that was not enjoyed by other people in the same benefit circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be safeguards for people who leave incapacity benefit and have to return to it before they have had time to build up sufficient national insurance contributions to re-establish their entitlement. That group of people already receives protection because of the 52-week linking rule introduced in October 1998. To ensure that people will not lose out under the new contributions test, the regulations provide for the relaxation of the test when someone has been on incapacity benefit in the tax year before the claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the occupational and other pension payment proposals. The regulations exempt severely disabled people in receipt of the highest rate of care component of disability living allowance from the abatement of incapacity benefit on account of pensions payments. We are also exempting three other forms of payment from the abatement provisions. The first includes individual permanent health insurance
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0158">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
arranged by the employee, permanent health insurance payment, for which the employee has contributed more than 50 per cent. of a premium, and health insurance that is intended to cover treatment costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will take account of permanent health insurance only where an employer has arranged it and the contract of employment has ended with that employer. We also recognise that there will be circumstances in which it will not be appropriate for occupational and personal pensions to be taken into account. The regulations therefore provide for occupational and personal pensions not to be taken into account where the pension payments are in connection with the death of a member of a scheme or where an occupational pension scheme is in deficit or has insufficient resources to pay the full pensions. The regulations also provide details of how pension income cases are to be administered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Act extends incapacity benefit to people aged between 16 and 19 who were incapacitated in youth and are unable to meet the normal national insurance conditions because of illness or disability. Following representations received during the passage of the Act that our intention to extend the age cut-off to 25 for people in higher education would not help certain young people with severe learning difficulties who are in mainstream education beyond the age of 20, we decided to widen the concession to include people in any form of education or work-based training. I know that that further concession was regarded as good news by Mencap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations set out how a person aged above 20, but below 25, can be permitted to receive incapacity benefit above the usual age cut-off of 20. The prescribed conditions are that a person must have been registered for and attended a course of full-time advanced or secondary education or vocational or work-based training for at least three months before he reached the age of 20. The course must have ended no earlier than one of the last two complete tax years before the year in which the benefit is claimed. For example, if a person's course ended in May 2002, he could still claim incapacity benefit under the youth provisions as late as December 2004, provided that he was still aged under 25 at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were also asked to help those who take up employment and earn below the lower earnings limit for a lengthy period before again becoming incapable of work. The regulations therefore enable people who leave incapacity benefit under the youth provisions for paid employment or training to requalify and do so for periods beyond the normal linking rules. People on disabled persons tax credit can return to incapacity benefit at the same level as they left it if they become incapable of work within two years, provided that they receive disabled persons tax credit for the week in which their contract ended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we recognise that people who have worked for more than two years and had earnings below the lower earnings limit would not be able to
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
qualify for incapacity benefit under that rule. The regulations therefore modify the rules to allow people entitled to incapacity benefit under the youth provisions and who are aged 20 or over, or where the education rules apply, 25 or over, to requalify for incapacity benefit outside the normal linking rules where they left incapacity benefit to work and have paid, or been credited with, contributions in both preceding tax years and have received disabled persons tax credit in at least one week in the preceding tax year. If they have not received disabled persons tax credit, they could requalify if they left incapacity benefit to work, earned less than the lower earnings limit in the past three tax years and made a fresh claim for benefit within 56 days of leaving employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister will understand if we have to study those statements with care. Can he explain in simple English the effect of the new relaxation for young people? Will someone who has previously been incapacitated who wants to try returning to employment subsequently be able, if it does not work out, to resume incapacity benefit as a result of the change? Will there be no disincentive to try resuming work and every incentive to have a go?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The goal expressed by the hon. Gentleman in admirable, understandable plain English is exactly the Government's goal. We want to prevent someone who receives incapacity benefit as a result of the youth provisions from thinking that it would not be in their best interests to return to work because they might lose a lifetime's entitlement to the benefit. The regulations are drafted in order to achieve that aim. People who are working sufficient hours to receive the disabled persons tax credit would receive protection, but it is conceivable that some people—perhaps with learning difficulties—could work for only one day a week. If such people did so for three, four, 10 or 20 years and found that they could no longer do so, they might lose the entitlement to incapacity benefit under the youth provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are intended to ensure that people will not be penalised for doing whatever work they can. Work is useful for the income that it brings in and it helps people to achieve independence. It is also important as a social inclusion measure: people acquire friends and a routine to follow; they are achieving something for themselves rather than being passively cared for in a day centre. The Government believe that that is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations will also provide protection for people returning to this country from abroad—people who were in receipt of the benefit through the youth provisions in the tax year prior to making a new claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally—a word that hon. Members will be pleased to hear—a year after the changes are introduced, the regulations automatically transfer on to long-term incapacity benefit those aged under 20 who were entitled to severe disablement allowance at the point of change. That will give this group access to long-term rate incapacity benefit at the same time as persons
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0159">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
incapacitated in youth who became entitled to short-term rate incapacity benefit under the new entitlement conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations also make consequential amendments to other minor social security regulations. Amendments are being made to the claims and payments regulations, the credits regulations, the payments on account, overpayments and recovery regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision to change the contribution conditions for incapacity benefit and to take account of early retirement pensions in certain circumstances were controversial when they were debated in the House. Those changes, however, are in the Act and are not open to amendment by regulation and are not up for discussion today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In contrast, these regulations are entirely beneficial. They exempt some people from the contribution conditions of pension provisions in the Act. Indeed, they will enable a wide range of deserving groups to continue to receive incapacity benefit on the same grounds as they do now. In addition, people in receipt of the highest rate care component of disability living allowance will be wholly exempted from the pensions payments proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend was speaking, I was thinking about a scenario in which someone on incapacity benefit has a spouse or partner who becomes pensionable and then dies; under the terms of the pension, part of that transfers to the disabled spouse or partner receiving incapacity benefit. Is it correct to say that that pension, now payable to the person receiving incapacity benefit, will not be deductible from the incapacity benefit? I see that my hon. Friend assents; if that is the case, I am happy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is the intention. If a pension is payable because of the death of a person who was its primary recipient, it is not intended that it should be counted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the logic of this somewhat triangular discussion that someone in receipt of his or her deceased partner's pension, or of a portion of it, is better off in terms of benefits than somebody who would otherwise receive his or her pension in his or her own right—a provision that is to be abated under the rules?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always difficult to draw parallels. The Government have sought to ensure that where people retire early from work and receive a higher than average early retirement pension, they should not expect full entitlement to incapacity benefit. The hon. Gentleman described a situation in which a spouse—in most cases, a widow—receives the equivalent of a widow's pension. That is a rather different situation and that is why we have made the concession proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham), ensuring that where the pension is payable because the primary beneficiary dies there should not be an abatement.

I reassure the Committee that the regulations ensure that all the commitments that a Government make during the passage of the legislation are met. I therefore commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.57 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship for the first time, Dr. Kumar, and to respond to the Minister's comments—also for the first time in such a gathering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the Minister has gone to some trouble to explain the regulations and to take the debate wider than a mere discussion of the text. I keep a list of Ministers with a good bedside manner; I shall have to consider him a potential candidate for inclusion. To respond to him not merely with encomia but to come to the substance of the matter, it is perhaps fitting that, as the daylight draws to a close and as, under the modernised timetable, the parliamentary week begins to labour towards its close, we should take time to debate complex technical regulations that affect a significant number of people, including some of the more vulnerable in our society. As parliamentary scrutineers, we should do our best to ensure that the regulations operate in the way intended and with fair consequences to those involved. The Minister will know that I do not come at the matter as an expert in social security—I would say modestly that there are occasional advantages in having a lay view—and I would not wish to sit an exam on the regulations; that is the Minister's job. However, I come at the legislation from a disability angle. I wish to ensure that matters are fairly operated, as I am sure do many members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister began, as I would like to do, with more general considerations. The first was the new deal for disabled people. There is no suggestion that we should oppose an attempt to focus on the provision of employment opportunities for disabled people, especially, as the Minister helpfully assured us, when there is no element of compulsion. It is a matter of free choice and therefore of widening their opportunity, for reasons—given by the Minister in an interesting later comment—that were not merely economic but social and related to the status of disabled people. As he will know, that is of huge importance in itself for people with learning disabilities, quite apart from the money and benefits. We welcome the concept of focusing on helping disabled people into the employment market, and we would echo the Minister's concern, even if he was a little dismissive of the previous Government's record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should all do we can to remedy the existing disturbing situation. At present, 3,300 people a week leave the labour market for incapacity benefit. Although I do not suggest that those people do not need or are not entitled to it, the rehabilitation rate from incapacity benefit back into employment is small. The Minister will be aware that my hon. Friend the Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) has made proposals to unify the benefit and rehabilitation funds and to improve matters. The intention is to draw on the better record—I do not wish to draw a precise
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0160">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
analogy—that is available in the private health market. Private health insurers are generally more successful at getting people back into the labour market. Those are broad considerations, but we shall watch with interest the progress of the Government's new deal for disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister winds up, he may want to comment further on the progress of pilot schemes, which, as he said, have now been rolled into a national scheme. I have a reservation—an objective and personal one, as well as a political one—as to whether the advice available, especially in specialist or difficult cases, always has sufficient firepower or expertise to help the disabled individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister did not want to debate the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 again, he conceded that many of its proposals, especially that which he delicately but accurately described as the abatement of occupational pension, were highly controversial. The Opposition were worried that they might send to people who would otherwise try to build up their own capacity for retirement a signal that saving did not pay. That might act as a perverse disincentive towards sensible and prudent conduct, and would be anomalous in terms of the various kinds of income involved. Again, the Minister may wish to touch on the matter. I do not intend to reopen the wide issue, which has been extensively debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has made a genuine effort to explain the import of the regulations. Their complex and technical wording is designed to implement political decisions for which the Minister is accountable, and, broadly speaking, to meet the undertakings that have been given and make sure that the operation of the new provisions is as sensible and fair as possible. In case the Minister feels that I am being churlish, I should say that the Minister's general approach to these controversial proposals has been with good intent. I say on behalf of disabled people and other beneficiaries that, in so far as the Secretary of State for Social Security recently announced further improvements in their position—although they must be set against the issues that we did not like in the legislation—we welcome that statement. We are dealing with people who are often in considerable difficulty, even though some may be strong economically. As human beings, let alone as politicians, we all want to respond to the problem as constructively as we can and try to ensure that such people can enjoy a high quality of life and a degree of status and respect in our society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I approach the regulations very much in that spirit. The Minister has done his best to explain them in detail as well as having taken a wide sweep. However, I want to flag up previous concerns, to which he may wish to respond further. Part 1A is more or less about mildly relieving the provisions of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act. It protects the position of those who were not able to have made a first contribution of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
sort that will be expected in future and who have been on previous types of benefit. Can the Minister confirm that in general terms?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I missed the hon. Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Part 1A deals with the supplementary provisions on the contribution conditions. It protects those people who had previously been on different benefits or who did not have the normal contribution record by ensuring that they can transfer to the benefit properly. The Minister is nodding his head, but he may wish to clarify the point further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part IV relates to the additional conditions for people who were incapacitated in youth. The Minister adequately explained such a provision. However, I hope that he will give us general assurances to round up the matter. Part V relates to abatement. I am a little worried about its reference to personal health insurance for two reasons. First, the hon. Gentleman said that, if the employee contributed at least 50 per cent., the amount would be discounted. Secondly, he said that, if the employer had paid for contribution in full, it would not be discounted. Again, I ask that in the spirit of our exchanges on a tripartite basis about the equity between a partner's pension and that of an individual. I am a little concerned that if, for example, pay had been abated against a pension paid by the employer—as a deal, perhaps even by agreement—as opposed to the employee paying the pension contribution himself, some inequity might arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be more familiar with the lead legislation than I am, so I should appreciate his assuring the Committee that any abatement of personal health insurance is adequately secured under the primary legislation. Although we have not had to work through the details in Committee, I know that they are primarily about pensions and I want to ensure that they are in vires of the legislation. Was what was envisaged explained at the time? If not, the position will be difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to paragraph 28 on page 8 of the document, which is also part of part V. Will the Minister explain the practical effect of the priority of deductions taken for the purposes of reduction of benefit
	<br><blockquote><p>initially against so much of the benefit as falls to be paid at the personal rate?</p></blockquote>
The provision refers to the reduction in terms of adult dependants and dependent children. I do not know whether such provision will make a real difference. I presume that it is designed to protect the position of dependent children, although, if it is the same pot of money, I am not sure whether it will make a difference in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister anticipate being a significant number of claimants with dependent children? As they would also be receiving an occupational pension, there may not be many, although many of us know some people in that position. How many people are likely to be affected? The situation could be difficult for people with families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0161">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
The Minister made an interesting remark about taking occupational pensions into account when the scheme is, if not insolvent, in financial difficulties and unable to pay the full amount of pension. As I understand it, if the pension fund trustees do not have enough money in the pension and the entitlement must be scaled down because it is semi-insolvent, only the amount of occupational pension that is actually paid will be taken into account, not the amount that ought to accrue. What happens if unpaid pension is subsequently recovered and entitlements are paid out? Members of the Committee will be familiar with the Child Support Agency. Difficulties can arise if large bills are suddenly demanded from people who did not realise that money might be clawed back from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an interesting reference to the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations. If a payment is being scaled down because an occupational pension exists, the payments can be spaced out into what might be called economic periods. I should like the Minister to comment, because he must realise that claimants will not be pleased—to put it delicately—if their incapacity benefit is abated because an occupational pension exists. Such people will not necessarily be affluent or full of funds, as the Minister knows. They might need the money regularly. What is in the Minister's mind? I should like an assurance that, if a claim is reasonable—I do not mean the rate of 1p a week—the claimant's wishes will tend to take priority over an accountant's narrow view about the cost of payment. After all, the claimant will not receive more than the overall envelope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister confirm that there will be no losers as a result of the regulations and that we are not stepping backwards from the primary legislation, whether we like that or not? Has he consulted fully on the regulations? The Minister mentioned Mencap in relation to the linking rules, and I pay tribute to the Government's decision. Will anyone be unhappy with the regulations? It would help the Committee if the Minister clarified that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members are not enthusiastic about the context of the regulations. They are based on the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999, which was controversial in some respects, as the Minister conceded. We are not especially enamoured of the complexity of the regulations, although it does not surprise us. I do not imagine that many of us will want to explain them in our constituency surgeries tomorrow night; even the Minister looks a little diffident on that point. However, he has attempted to explain them to the Committee, and there have been some constructive changes. If he responds to the points that I have made and that other hon. Members will make, it will be helpful to have debated and clarified the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Bermingham

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Every time I attend a Committee nowadays, there is a different Chairman whom I have not seen before. That is either because I have had a little sleep or because I
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
have become old; regrettably, I think that it is the latter. I do not intend to detain the Committee long, but three points cause me some concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first point concerns the abatement in respect of the periodic payment. Many people in receipt of the periodic payment live hand to mouth, day to day and week to week, so the reduction, even by £5, of their weekly amount will affect them. At the end of three months, people will receive a net pension payment of £60, and at the end of the year they will receive around £240. That reduction of £5 may bring real hardship, accumulating over a period. Therefore, I ask the Minister to consider that point. I cannot think of an answer to it off the top of my head, but there must be a better way than to penalise those people week by week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the point made by the hon. Gentleman. Does he agree that, if someone is really short of money and has to borrow from a loan shark, for example, the net effect is negative and the worry is considerable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We call loan sharks tallymen in our part of the world; they charge 49 per cent. minimum base interest on a weekly basis, and it is about time that we legislated to get rid of them. I put that down as a marker for the future, and hope that the Minister hears what I say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point concerns the family income, as I call it. In an intervention, I raised the subject of the third-party pension payment, when the husband has a pension that is reduced because it is to be paid, on his death, to his wife during the rest of her lifetime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying before we were interrupted by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) and his pursuit of his particular interests, I am worried by the overall family position as affected by abatement in respect of pension payments. I welcome the disallowance in calculating abatement of the third-party pension, because the family that receives it has suffered enough, as the primary pension has been taken from the family income by the death of the pensioner. However, the position of widows and handicapped children who remain dependent over the age of 18 should be considered, too. I flag that one up as one to be debated in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the point made in my first intervention. In my local authority, several worthwhile, hard-working councillors have found that, because of their incapacity, the change in the system of payment of councillors from their former allowance to a set statutory amount that is subject to tax and national insurance deductions means that they are now losing money. One councillor tells me that, after all the adjustments are made from which the old allowance was exempt, the total amount that she receives from the annual allowance is the princely sum of £2.50 a month. She is clearly losing because, under the old allowance, she would have been paid with adjustments
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0162">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
and exemptions taken into account. That is only one example; two or three other councillors are caught in the same trap. I have written to the Minister about the matter and he has investigated it. He may say that there is little else that he can do, but the problem exists in not only my constituency but many others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Disabled people have much to offer; they have the experience of being disabled and can understand when buildings should be adapted. They can use their experience in the practical matters of the day-to-day work of the council. However, we are effectively excluding them because they cannot afford the reduction in income. Therefore, my cri de coeur to my hon. Friend the Minister is: could the issue be looked at again so that it can be resolved? I am asking not that they should in any way profit from it, but that they should not suffer a loss. There must be an answer and it must be found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have delayed the Committee long enough, and no doubt will get my share of opprobrium from colleagues in the Committee, who will, no doubt, take me to task once again. I shall therefore retreat quietly. I declare an interest as a practising lawyer, although I do not practise disablement law. The law that I practise is a field in which hon. Members may not necessarily want to instruct me—[
	<i>Interruption,</i>]—or indeed pay me, as some could not afford it. As I said, I registered my interest in a general way because in this state of the witch-finder general, one never knows who will complain about an interest that has not been declared.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.36 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I congratulate the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) on gleaning so much from what, I accept, are impenetrable regulations. They are impenetrable because the Government have taken steps to ensure that precisely those whom we all agree should not be disadvantaged by the new provisions in the Act will get the exemptions that are required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Breaking my own self-denying ordinance of not intervening too much—I promise that I have not been provoked—can the Minister give us an assurance that in the new circumstances explanatory material will be available to all those who could make use of it, so that they do not have to resort to the regulations to find out their entitlements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can give the hon. Gentleman that assurance. I shall briefly deal with his comments about the importance of rehabilitation. Of course we want to help those whose health is declining or who face an increasing burden of disability to retain their jobs and remain in work, rather than be forced on to incapacity benefit. Some of our early new deal for disabled people pilots have piloted such measures with some success. Some of the measures worked well. Some did not, but we learned what types of interventions do not work, and as a result, we shall shortly be announcing four larger-scale pilots under the new deal for disabled people, to examine the potential for intervening at a
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
much earlier stage than is normal. Incapacity benefit is not normally paid until six months after a person has left work, and if we want to keep people in work we need to intervene much earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing particularly new in the proposals of the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts). The ideas that he is suggesting are precisely those that we have been piloting for the past two years under the new deal for disabled people, but I am pleased that there is widespread support for that approach on both sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The abatement provision for occupational pensions should not have come as a complete surprise to Opposition Members, because it was the Conservative party that first introduced the abatement provision in relation to pensions in contribution-based jobseeker's allowance. The abatements that we propose are rather more benign. They start when the pension is more than £85 a week, rather than when it is more than £50 a week, and we have a taper of 50p in the pound rather than a complete cut-off pound for pound.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the changes that we have made will provide a disincentive for people to pay into pension schemes, because the vast majority do so throughout their working lives in the expectation that they will need a pension on retiring at normal retirement age. Most people who pay in believe not that they are contributing to an early retirement, ill-health pension, but that they are making provision for their normal retirement. In any case, the vast majority of people in receipt of incapacity benefit will lose not one penny of benefit as a result of the changes that we have made, and those who have pensions of more than £85 a week will be at least £85 a week better off than they would have been if they had not paid into an occupational pension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the vast proportion would not be worse off. How many people will suffer some abatement as a proportion of the total number with an occupational pension?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some 170,000 people who receive occupational early retirement pensions of more than £100 a week will be disadvantaged to some extent. In addition, those who receive pensions of between £85 and £100 a week will also be affected, but I am afraid that I do not have all the figures to hand. The vast majority of those will not lose their entire incapacity benefit; indeed, to do so a single person would have to have a combined income from his occupational pension and incapacity benefit of some £12,000. The figure is almost £20,000 in family income for those with dependants such as a wife and two children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned permanent health insurance, which is covered under section 63(5)(b) of the Act. We have exempted permanent health insurance payments made entirely or predominantly by the individual, to which the employer contributes less than 50 per cent., because we do not want to create a disincentive and dissuade people from taking out such insurance. We want to take account only of permanent health insurance policies that make payments after a person has left his place of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0163">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
employment. In practice, we believe that few such schemes are in operation at the moment. However, we want to prevent the creation of a loophole whereby employers, instead of making occupational pension contributions on behalf of an employee, make permanent health insurance contributions that are payable only after a person has retired, as that would in effect be an occupational pension dressed up in different clothing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We simply want to ensure that the occupational pension approach is applied consistently. We do not want to make deductions for people who remain in employment but receive permanent health insurance payments as an occupational sick pay arrangement, for instance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has half-anticipated the point that I was about to make. I should like an assurance that, as a matter of good practice, nothing in the regulations discourages employers from providing—indeed, there is every reason to encourage employers to provide—such a sick pay arrangement for their employees as part of the employee benefits. Can he assure me that nothing in the regulations would derogate that and that he is simply trying to prevent pensions by the back door after employment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely what the Government are doing with the regulations. If an employer wants to take out insurance to meet the costs of providing a good sick pay arrangement that is better than the statutory sick pay arrangements, we would encourage him to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked why we have listed the different elements of incapacity benefit in order in regulation 25. We have done so for complicated legal reasons, but I believe that I can satisfy the hon. Gentleman by saying that the provision will make no difference to the amount of incapacity benefit that people receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members asked whether we intend to make a deduction if trustees cannot meet their obligations to pay a pension in full. We intend to take account only of the amount of pension that is paid. If the rate of payment of pension increases later for some reason, such as an employer having made a lump sum payment
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
into a fund so that it could meet its obligations, we would of course start taking account of the payment at the higher rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With notional pensions, we intend to take account only of income that someone might reasonably have been expected to receive as a result of purchasing an annuity. We do not intend to require people to bring the full benefit forward beyond retirement in a way that an occupational pension scheme would not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I must tell the hon. Gentleman that we have not had a formal process of consultation on these regulations because, under the normal social security arrangements, regulations that are promulgated shortly after the passage of an Act do not have to go to the Social Security Advisory Committee. However, I can give him the assurance that he and others principally want to hear: there will be no losers as a result of the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham) raised a number of points. The provisions in relation to periodic payments are simply intended to allow a small amount of incapacity benefit to be paid at intervals of more than a week. If someone receives just 5p incapacity benefit a week, it is pointless to send out an order. My hon. Friend again raised the issue of councillors receiving incapacity benefit. As he acknowledged, I have looked at the issue and responded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me say two things that I hope will reassure my hon. Friend. The Government do not wish to prevent disabled people from standing for public office; that would be against everything that we stand for. We want those elected to public office to represent the whole range of society. We want no one to be excluded from the chance to stand and we certainly do not want the benefits arrangements to do that. It should be our goal—as far as it is possible to achieve it—to ensure that someone standing for public office, who is in receipt of disability benefits, does not suffer a loss by so doing. I will be happy look at those cases again if my hon. Friend wants to write to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee agrees to the motion. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
