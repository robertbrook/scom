	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>EMPLOYED PERSONS (SAFETY) BILL</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that my provisional selecion of Amendments is available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Hattersley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>"That during the proceedings on the Employed Persons (Safety) Bill the Committee do meet on Wednesday next at half-past Ten o'clock and Four o'clock and thereafter on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock."</p></blockquote>
May I briefly explain why the Motion includes a reference to next Wednesday afternoon at four o'clock? All Members of the Committee are anxious to see the Bill pass into law in some form. They will understand that, to give it a realistic chance of becoming law, it is necessary for its Committee stage to be completed by next Wednesday. I have no doubt that reasonable progress will result in the Amendments being disposed of in two mornings, but as what I can only describe as a "fail safe", I thought it wise to make provision for a meeting next Wednesday afternoon. I am sure that the Committee wants it to pass into law at some stage, and therefore I suspect that I will have unanimous agreement to the Motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Dudley Smith)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to vote against the Motion. I have not consulted my hon. Friends about how they feel, but I am a little unhappy about it because it is fairly unusual with a Private Member's Bill to have such a Sittings Motion at the beginning, the implication being that we are in for a long and hard Committee stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at the Amendments, it would be unrealistic to suppose that we will get through this stage in a morning. However, strange things happen. On the other hand, it would be unreasonable to suggest that we will not get through it by the end of the morning Sitting next week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that there will be no en-
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
deavour on anyone's part deliberately to hold up the proceedings, but a Bill of this complexity and importance may warrant a couple of Sittings, particularly when a fair number of Amendments have been tabled. It is rather unusual to table a Sittings Motion of this kind. I can understand the hon. Gentleman's concern and he describes it as a fail safe mechanism in case things go wrong. On the other hand, with a Private Member's Bill, hon. Members have a rooted objection to Sitting late, and it should not be encouraged with Private Members' Bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not propose to object to the Motion. It would be rather surprising if we completed the Bill this morning, but I see no reason why, if we make satisfactory and sensible progress, we should not finish by lunch-time next week. I hope that if the Motion is carried, that will be the aim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Holland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley), with his customary courtesy, gave me notice of his intention to move a Sittings Motion in these terms, and I am grateful to him for his courtesy; but he cannot, and must not, expect reciprocal concessions from me to the extent of not objecting now to the Sittings Motion. He cannot expect me to facilitate the passage of a Bill of whose provisions I thoroughly disapprove. My opposition to the Bill is well known to the House. It dates from early in 1970, if not the end of 1969, when the terms of this legislation were first published in another Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if I did not have a history of opposition to the Bill, even if I were able to offer it qualified approval, even if all the Amendments tabled by my hon. Friends and myself, Amendments which we regard as the absolute minimum to make the Bill workable and reasonable, were acceptable to the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends, it would still be intolerable that what I regard as a totally unreasonable Sittings Motion should be thrust upon us. A number of hon. Gentlemen are present this morning to try to change what some of us regard as a bad piece of legislation into a Bill which may have a chance of making a contribution, however small, to the cause of industrial safety. To do this, we are prepared to give up Wednesday mornings in order to thrash out the areas of difference between us and to produce, if possible, a reason-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0337">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
able piece of legislation that will go down in history entirely to the credit of the hon. Member for Sparkbrook.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances, is it just, right or fair that, in pursuance of that end, we should be denied the chance next Wednesday of taking part in the business of the House, whatever it may be? Some hon. Gentleman may already have Committee commitments for next Wednesday afternoon, party committees, statutory committees or procedural committees. It is not good enough to say that the extra time is necessary because the Bill is in Committee so late in the Session. Whose fault is that? Certainly it is not the fault of my hon. Friends and myself. I say this with the natural reluctance of a backbench Member when speaking of any Government, but it is certainly not the fault of the Government. Nor is it the fault of any procedural committee of the House, so far as I am aware.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all, the hon. Member was first in the list for a Private Member's Bill last November; he came top of the Ballot; he had his own free choice of when the Bill would go through its various stages. He selected 4th February for its Second Reading. He got it, much to my regret, as I said at the time. That gave plenty of time for the Bill to pass all its stages in the House of Commons and the House of Lords and be on the Statute Book by now. That could have been done without inconveniencing hon. Members by having afternoon or evening Sittings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to hon. Gentlemen on both sides of the Committee to consider carefully why the Bill has been delayed until the eleventh hour before coming to Committee. Could it be that the hon. Gentleman is more concerned with saving himself time and trouble than with allowing time for the discussion necessary with a controversial Measure? On Derby Day, the day of the greatest flat race, it may be inappropriate to accuse the hon. Gentleman of rushing his fencesâ€”it is a pity that our Committee was not Sitting on the day of anoher race, when it might have been more appropriate. In that case, the Bill could have been discussed comfortably, without any inconvenient Sittings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman has checked the recordâ€”as I am sure he hasâ€”he has known since early 1970 that the Bill does not have the unanimous approval of hon. Members. Certainly, he knows that it has not had my approval. Throughout he has
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
been under no illusions and has known that his Bill was wholly opposed by me and that it received only qualified approval from some of my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At no time has he been left in doubt that there would be a number of Amendments for discussion in Committee, and probably on Report. I have made no secret of that. I made sure that the Amendments bearing my name and those of two of my hon. Friends should be tabled as soon as possible after the notification of the date of the Sitting of the Committee so that the hon. Gentleman would have ample time to consider where he could meet us and by how much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I first told the hon. Gentleman that I hoped to be on the Committee and would seek to improve his Bill as long ago as 4th February. I can only assume that the Bill has been deliberately delayed coming to Committee to suit the hon. Gentleman's convenience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ronald Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is labouring under a grave misapprehension. The Committee of Selection determines when a Bill shall go to a Committee, and that Committee did not allocate a Sitting to the Committee until two weeks ago. It was out of the hands of my hon. Friend entirely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Holland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot believe that the Committee of Selection, without some prodding from somewhere, would deliberately put back on the list a Bill that was high on the list at the beginning. I should have thought that it would take the Bills in rotation, unless it received a direct request not to do so from one of the Bill's sponsors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue is perfectly straightforward. We obtained approval for this Committee on 4th February, but on Friday, 31st January, a large number of Bills went through on the nod, with the result that they all took precedence over this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Holland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of other Bills went through Committee before this, having had Second Readings subsequent to this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is quite wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Holland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I am in error, I apologise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hattersley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the hon. Gentleman wishes to pursue this issue,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0338">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
but in case be really wishes to speak on the Motion, I should like to explain. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Shoreditch and Finsbury (Mr. Ronald Brown) raised this matter in the Committee of Selection on several occasions, and I have written to the Leader of the House, as has the Opposition Shadow spokesman on employment matters. Constant pressure has been brought to bear on the authorities to bring the Bill into Committee earlier. That was what we wished for all along. We, not the hon. Gentleman, are faced with an intolerable situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Holland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All members of the Committee are faced with an intolerable situation. I hope that, if the hon. Gentleman wishes to retain the goodwill of the Committee, he will withdraw the Sittings Motion and replace it with something more normal. If not, I feel I cannot do less than ask other members of the Committee who feel as I do to resist what I regard as an intolerable Sittings Motion, which has been put to us on the first morning before the hon. Gentleman has even had a chance to see what progress we make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course we understand that, if progress is slow, it is normal to ask for additional Sittings, but we do not yet know that progress will be slow, for this is the beginning of the first Sitting. I feel that the hon. Gentleman is being hasty and I hope that he will withdraw the Motion, or that some of my hon. Friends will join me in dividing the Committee against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am surprised that, before the Committee has begun its deliberations, we should have a request for such an unusual Sittings Motion. I have never known this to happen before and I find it very strange. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) is asking the members of the Committee to put themselves out considerably in order to give the Bill a fair wind, and I do not feel that that is a fair request.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I and other hon. Members, such as the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mr. Golding), are on other Standing Committees. He and I will be Sitting on Tuesday and Thursday morning next
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
week and if is even rumoured that we may Sit longer on a Bill which has already had ten Sittings. We are Sitting on Wednesday morning and now we are being asked to Sit on Wednesday afternoon as well. That really means that on Tuesday, Thursday and all day Wednesday, our time will be taken up with Committee work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Golding</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say for the record that I do not mind working a three-day week?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made that point, but I do not necessarily believe that work stuck away in Committee is the best or only way to make one's contribution to the work of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had arranged, after a short visit to the Middle East during the Whitsun Recess, a meeting next Wednesday afternoon, which I thought would be a sure time, with various people to see whether we in this country could do something to help to bring peace to that strife-worn area. People are coming from abroad and some are coming from outside London and it will be extremely inconvenient to try to put off that meeting. If the hon. Gentleman says that my absence from this Committee will not be noticed and that he will not worry if I am not here, I do not think that that is giving proper consideration to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A second reason, which surprises me with a parliamentarian of the hon. Member's experience, is that on Second Readingâ€”I shall come to this later if I may, Mr. Wallace, but it is important for me to bring it in now for I am being asked to co-operate with the hon. Gentlemanâ€”I pointed out a major objection to the Bill in that it seemed to provide only for unionised firms to take advantage of it. I made the point strongly and said that I had opposed the previous editions of the Bill on those grounds. The hon. Gentleman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"â€¦we shall do our best to meet the point put by the hon. Gentleman."â€”[OFFICIAL REPORT, 4th February, 1972; Vol. 830, 	<i>c</i>. 889.]</p></blockquote>
As far as I can see, instead of doing his best to meet my point, he has widened the scope of union involvement, and nothing has been done to provideâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is now discussing the merits of the Bill.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0339">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
The discussion is confined to the Sittings Motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are right, of course, Mr. Wallace. I hesitate. to pursue the point, because I shall do so in greater detail later. But I do not feel that I have received from the hon. Gentleman what he would call his best to meet my personal objection to the Bill. My objections to the Bill are very strong, and I see no reason why I should hasten its its passage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, we all know that the Robens Report on safety is likely to be presented at any time. I ask my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary whether, by any chance, there is a possibility that the Robens Report will be published before next Wednesday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has nothing to do with the Sittings Motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect Mr. Wallace, if the Robens Report on safety were to be presented during the next fortnight, it would basically alter the whole consideration of the Bill. I hope that while we are discussing it or shortly afterwards, my hon. Friend may be able to give us some indication of when the report may be expected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that the hon. Member for Sparkbrook has not made one move to help me to support the Bill. I regret it, but because of that I can see no reason to put myself out to support the Motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Redmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most disappointed with the Motion because it seems to indicate that the Amendment to which I have put my name will be resisted by the sponsor of the Bill. I take the view that this is an extremely good Bill in principle, but wrong in detail, and I am seeking to improve it. We could get through the businesss this morning if the sponsors of the Bill would accept Amendments which I believe would improve the Bill a great deal. I have a considerable interest in safety matters and it is for that reason, I presume, that I am on the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is rather extraordinary that the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mr. Golding) should talk about working a three-day week. For the last few months I have been working a seven-day week and I can see absolutely no hope of being
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
here next Wednesday afternoon. The Opposition may be rather glad of that, but I should feel that I was failing in my duty if I were to let this Motion go through, knowing that if the Committee were to continue, I should not be able to take part in important debates on Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know yet what business will be on the Floor of the House next Wednesday afternoon, I do not think that anyone else does. It may well be something that will demand the presence of all of us. If it happens to be the Local Government Bill, I shall be taking part in the debate on the first Amendment, which would definitely preclude my attendance in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Holland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be something to do with the European Communities Bill, in which case half the Committee would want to be in the House for one reason and half for another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That expresses the point. Until we know what the House will be doing next Wednesday, we are all in some difficulty. But I know that two constituents want to see me next Wednesday afternoon, and I have warned them that I may not be available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely the whole trouble with Parliament at present is that we are spending far too much time talking to ourselves here and not nearly enough time in our constituencies listening to the real people outside who know what is going on. We steadily become more and more out of touch; we have a week's recess at Whit-sun, which is not long enough, and we rely on the Summer Recess for moving among our constituents. In fact, if it were not because I have had so little time in my constituency, the two people who want to see me next Wednesday would not have come here: I should have gone to see them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that my whole object in being here is to get through a Bill which is good in principle but bad in detail, and I am most anxious to see that the detail is improved. My hon. Friends have mentioned trade unionisation of safety. Personally, I am interested in productivity and I think that safety goes with productivity. For that reason I am seeking to improve the whole of safety in industry. But we shall not do it as the Bill is framed and I should like all the Amendments to be adopted. If the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Normanton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must honestly confess to the Committee that I take part in this debate at this stage and on this subject with considerable misgivings. I do so for a number of reasons but I shall not belabour the Committee because I know time, particularly for the hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparbrook (Mr. Hattersley), is precious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am deeply concerned about this apparent intention that our debates should run into the afternoon of today week. It has been mentioned that the Local Government Bill may well be on the Floor of the House. Even hon. Members with the most unenthusiastic regard for the European Communities Bill would welcome Amendments to it and I have suggested one. If we are continuing this debate next Wednesday afternoon and the European Communities Bill is being debated in the House, I shall be in a grave dilemma.

This is only the third Standing Committee on which I have been placed. I am reminded of the last when certain hon. Members opposite entered into a very lengthy discussion on a Motion of this kind and used precisely the argument which one or two of my hon. Friends have usedâ€”the conflict of timing keeping us away from the Chamber.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the Bill completely fresh, but only from the parliamentary point of view. I confess to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) that I did not take part in the debate on the Floor of the House. I was unable to do so because my father was being buried that day.

	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, West (Mr. Redmond) states that he has tabled Amendments to the Bill. I have none, perhaps because I was appointed to the Committee at a rather late stage.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Holland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These Amendments are grouped for the convenienece of the Committee in order that hon. Members may have one composite discussion. The several Amendments which make up the series are not necessarily consequential upon each other and would not otherwise have been taken together, but my hon. Friends and I feel that this will make for a more compact discussion, with the Question being put on the composite Amendment because, on these Amendments we want all or nothing. I am glad
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
to note that at least there is some harmony in the Committee: the hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) and his hon. Friends have joined with me and my hon. Friends in sponsoring Amendment No. 6, which is consequential on his Amtndrnent No. 2 and my Amendment No. 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 1, to which I shall address my main remarks, seeks to do a number of things because it is a conglomerate of a number of Amendments. First, it raises the number of employees in a factory above which the Bill will apply from 10 to 25. The reason for this is simply that in factories where only 10 persons are employed the owner is usually in daily contact with them and they are all familiar to him and he is familiar to them and approachable on a personal basis. He probably knows their families and is involved with them. So, from an accident prevention point of view, there would appear to be no logic in appointing one of those 10 to be a safety representative, which creates a formalised relationship where none needs exist, and we feel that it is using a sledge-hammer to crack a nut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At what size of firm the regular contact between owner and workers is lost depends on the type of industry, on the size of the plant, on the personalities involved, but, from my own experience of industrial relations I believe that in general diminishing regular communication due to size does not normally start in factories employing fewer than 25. If there is a need for safety representatives, if there is any justification for their appointment from an accident prevention point of view, such need would become apparent only where 25 or more people were employed. So that is why we seek to raise the minimum size of factory in terms of numbers of employees from 10 to 25.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Normanton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figure of 25 is presumably put forward in substitution for 10. Again, from my very long factory experience, I am not at all happy about the use of the words, "exclusive of casual workers". When is a casual worker casual? I mention this because in one of my works we have 85 people on the books, but 60 of them come when they wish. That is a characteristic of the industry and the district. They are technically on the books: would they qualify, or would the remaining 20 be outside the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0342">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
provision? Would the 65 workers be called casual? We have their insurance cards, but they are free to come to work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Holland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw my hon. Friend's attention to the fact that my hon. Friends the Members for Harrow, West (Mr. John Page) and Bolton, West (Mr. Redmond) and I foresaw some difficulties arising out of the use of the term "casual worker" and, therefore, though we cannot discuss it at this stage, perhaps, Mr. Wallace, you will allow me to draw my hon. Friend's attention to Amendment No. 23, which will be discussed in the next group of Amendments. By that we place the onus on the Secretary of State to decide what should be a casual worker. We found it difficult and we could not agree among ourselves how to define it explicitly, with a definition which could not be disputed in law. Therefore, we have passed the buck in Amendment No. 23 and I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle (Mr. Normanton) will intervene when it is debated and will give us the benefit of his experience of such questions as when a casual worker is not a casual worker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Normanton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for allowing me to intervene once again, but I am not satisfied with his explanation. If in a factory one has to use all the administrative machinery available to try to discover whether Mrs. Smith is casualâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is straying into a detailed discussion of Amendment No. 23.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Normanton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, Mr. Wallace, surely it is a substantive part of the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We could take Amendment No. 23 now, if the Committee so wished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Holland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, Mr. Wallace, I think that we have enough to discuss and, unless the Committee overrules me, I think that we had better leave the selection as it stands. I find no fault with your selection, Mr. Wallace, nor, I hope, will my hon. Friend or hon. Gentlemen opposite. Otherwise, I can see our
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
discussion on each group going much wider than we intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will find no fault with Mrs. Smith.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Holland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sureâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Normanton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: She is a good member of a trade union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Holland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure whether my hon. Friend was maligning Mrs. Smith in describing her as casual. However, in view of your ruling, Mr. Wallace, if I may leave the subject of casual workers until we reach the next group of Amendments, I should like to start on Amendment No. 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having dealt with the raising of the minimum number from 10 to 25, the Amendment seeks to correct what my hon. Friends and I consider to be bad drafting by changing
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the time being employed by"</p></blockquote>
to "regularly employed by". We believe that we make the meaning less ambiguous in law and more precise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its original form,
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the time being employed"</p></blockquote>
is open to unnecessarily wide interpretation, and because of that it is liable to create industrial relations disputes where co-operation and harmony between management and workpeople are vital if safety arrangements are to be effective. That part of the Amendment does not materially alter the intention, but it makes the Clause more precise and improves the drafting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Spark-brook will accept that we have good intentions, whatever he may feel about our opposition to his proposal. This can be described in no other way than as a simple attempt to help him with the drafting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But now we come to the substance of the matter. My hon. Friends and I do not accept that the right of appointing safety representatives should rest solely with recognised trade unions or, for that matter, organisations of workers which are, as I understand it, merely unregistered as distinct from registered trade unions, or that they should be imposed where existing arrangements make them unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the present legal definition of a trade union, I imagine that to some
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0343">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
extent I carry hon. Gentlemen opposite with me in seeking to broaden the scope of the Bill beyond exclusively registered trade unions. I know from the hon. Gentleman's own Amendment, No. 2, and his joining with me in the deletion of subsection (3) in Amendment No. 6 that I would carry him part of the way with me in my argument. Events have made the terminology of the Bill much more restrictive than even its sponsors originally intended. I am sure that we recognise that and that all of us who have taken a continuing interest in the subject know it to be true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, it is the wish of the hon. Member for Sparkbrook and his hon. Friends who are sponsoring the Bill to eliminate to some extent the restriction of the operation of the Bill to legally defined trade unions. I think that one of my hon. Friends who is a signatory of the Amendment with me may say more about that matter later, but in passing I would say that the hon. Gentleman's Amendment No. 2 would not be acceptable to us. I think that he understands that, because he has studied what we have had to say about it. We are seeking to broaden the scope to include any factory with workpeople, not only those factories that happen to have either a registered or an unregistered trade union membership. We want it to cover every factory with workpeople, and for it to be at the discretion of the majority of the workpeople, whether represented or not, to decide whether they need safety representatives and to have the appointing of them. Of course, if it were a union factory, the union would be dealing with a majority and that would fall naturally into place. But to put it into the Bill is unnecessarily to restrict the appointment of safety representatives and who should appoint them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that so far in discussing Amendment No. 1 I still carry a majority of the Committee with me. We are trying to broaden the scope of the Bill. We are trying to be less restrictive. The hon. Member for Sparkbrook and his hon. Friends who have sponsored Amendment No. 2 are far too restrictive. I shall not pursue that in moving Amendment No. 1, but some of my hon. Friends may wish to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move now to what may appear a slightly more contentious part of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
Amendment. I hope that hon. Gentlemen will not reject out of hand the need to preserve satisfactory arrangements that exist already. That is the purpose of the next part of the Amendment. In 1970, when the scheme in the Bill was first published, the First Secretary at that time gave repeated assurances to industry and to the House that she did not want to upset voluntary arrangements or discourage future ones. I am sure that she did that in good part, and it was the kind of undertaking that the hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Harold Walker) also gave. I cannot recall the precise occasion, but I am sure that he does not disagree. I see him nodding in assent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Normanton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervene purely for guidance from my hon. Friend. He was discussing Amendment No. 1. Which Amendment is he discussing now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Holland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I am confusing the Committee. I am dealing with Amendment No. 1. I made a passing reference a moment ago to Amendment No. 2. I did not want to spend too much time on it because I want to press on with Amendment No. 1. When I speak of several amendments, I mean that Amendment No. 1 consists of several amendments strung together. I am taking it piece by piece so that the Committee may be able to understand what we are trying to do in each proposed change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with the first part of the Amendment:
	<br><blockquote><p>"25 or more persons, exclusive of casual workers, are regularly employed by the occupier to work in the factory â€¦"â€”</p></blockquote>
and now I have come to the next part:
	<br><blockquote><p>"â€¦and either there are no arrangements for joint consultation on safety or such arrangements exist but the employees indicate by a majority in a ballot their dissatisfaction with such arrangements â€¦"</p></blockquote>
That is the part of Amendment No. 1 I am dealing with now. I am sorry to have confused my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The First Secretary at that time, the right hon. Lady the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle), and her officialsâ€”and also, I am sure, the hon. Member for Doncasterâ€”claimed that they did not want to upset voluntary arrangements or discourage future ones, and that Clause 1(5) as it then stood was specifically designed to ensure that that would not happen. This was the Government's answer at the time. It is because we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0344">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
believe that Clause 1(5) will not ensure any such thing that we have drafted this part of the Amendment. It may have the opposite effect, since it could undermine existing arrangements by superimposing a statutory and untried system of safety representatives on a voluntary and hitherto quite satisfactory consultative arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the main purposes of the Amendment is to extend the right of appointing safety representatives to all workers and not to restrict it to registered trade unions or to unregistered trade unions or organisations of workers, while at the same time to give positive encouragement to employers to devise systems of joint consultation or to improve existing systems which are satisfactory to all employees. We still leave the onus on the employees as a whole to make known their views and put them into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 1 recognises also that there are more advanced systems of consultation than liaison between representatives and management. There are, for example, total involvement schemes of hazard spotting, safety-sampling and damage control systems. Many large companies have now adopted systems of damage control or total loss control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Essentially, the concept of damage control stems from drawing the necessary distinction between accident causes and injury effects. There is the man who trips over a piece of wood and saves himself from falling, and the man who trips over a piece of wood, hits the floor and breaks his wrist. Clearly, the only way to ensure that no injury is caused in either case is to record the source of the potential injury and remove it. That is what we are talking about in damage control. The only way to eliminate all potential injuries is to remove all potential causes. This necessitates the involvement of the whole work force, whose co-operation must be enlisted in order that they may learn the principles involved and play their part in pointing out sources of danger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From this concept of damage control it has been learned that many interrelated factors may cause injury. This has led to the formation of the more complex idea of total loss control, which goes beyond the immediate causes of potential injury and examines all the problems of industrial health, safety of personnel and
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
equipment, fire protection and security.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend would explain that concept a little more. It is fairly new to me. Perhaps he will give some examples of how it has been applied in practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Holland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his interest. I have a note here of the experience of the British Steel Corporation at one or two of its sites. I shall be brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[	<i>Interruption.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In spite of what some hon. Gentlemen opposite say, other members of the Committee may be interested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all right on this side.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Holland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In courtesy to my hon. Friend and other members of the Committee who may not be quite so all-knowing as the hon Member, I feel that it would be helpful to outline briefly the experience of the British Steel Corporation. It has introduced a number of experiments in damage control. In the bar mill at the Park Gate works of the Rotherham group,
	<br><blockquote><p>"full-scale introductory and training programmes for senior management, senior trade union officials, works councillors and shop-floor representatives on the principles of controlling and eliminating accident causes and the development of better methods of measuring safety performance were followed by a series of training sessions for line management, and finally an explanation of the principles and the reasons for the introduction of the scheme was given to all employees during normal working hours."</p></blockquote>
This is total involvement. It is not just one or two representatives.
	<br><blockquote><p>"In other Groups within the Corporationâ€”Redbourn and Normanby Parkâ€”involvement is encouraged by the attachment of trade union officials to safety departments for four week periods. The officials are set specific and demanding projects requiring reports which are then discussed and acted upon."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that hon. Members opposite are interested in this kind of safety development. It is important, and it is important that we put some of it on record. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for reminding me that I had this notice.
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is all part of the involvement plan, and the turnover of personnel in the scheme brings fresh ideas to the problems of safety. The representatives go back to the shop floor with greater authority born of experience, greater awareness of problems, and a knowl-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0345">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
edge and awareness of the need for co-operation between senior management, line management and employee.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>This has led to Joint Recommendations on Safety being put forward by foreman and shop-steward, an example of co-operation which goes far beyond the concept of a statutory safety representative and an imposed safety committee."</p></blockquote>
In such a comprehensive system involving the whole work force, where is there a place for a safety representative? Appointed at a time of potential industrial unease in the plant to exert political pressure, or introduced at a time when an advanced voluntary scheme of damage control is being introduced, the safety representatives might well cause resentment and militate against the co-operative efforts already achieved. Inspections such as would be required of safety representatives appointed under the Bill can clearly be no substitute for the total involvement of the work force, which our Amendment makes possible and against which, without our Amendment, the Bill will tend to militate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, by introducing the ballot system, the Amendment ensures the right of all employees to have a say in the appointment of their representatives if they wish. It reduces the danger of the safety of employees becoming a pawn in the game of a trouble-maker, which is always a danger in this sort of situation. For the benefit of those members of the Committee who may not be familiar with the Statutory Instrument to which we refer in our Amendmentâ€”it goes back to 1936â€”I should briefly explain the procedure laid down in that Instrument. First,
	<br><blockquote><p>"The ballot shall be conducted jointly by the occupier or his representatives and a representative chosen 'by the workpeople.'"</p></blockquote>
Thus, both employee and employer control the ballot jointly. That is the first safeguard.
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) The occupier shall furnish to the persons responsible for carrying out the ballot (	<i>a</i>) a list of the workpeople concerned, (	<i>b</i>) an adequate supply of ballot papers in the form prescribed â€¦ and not marked in any way whatsoever so as to identify the person voting."</p></blockquote>
That is the second safeguard.
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>c</i>) a suitable ballot box fitted with lock and key."</p></blockquote>
That is the third safeguard.
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) Arrangements shall be made to enable each worker concerned, at places adjacent to
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
the ballot box, to obtain a ballot paper and to mark it â€¦"â€”</p></blockquote>
as we do in our Parliamentary elections, and we all know something about thatâ€”
	<br><blockquote><p>"â€¦ screened from observation, before depositing it in the box."</p></blockquote>
That is laid down in the Statutory Instrument. And to ensure anonymity,
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) The name of each worker to whom a ballot paper is handed out shall be marked off on the list of workpeople concerned by the person handing out the ballot paper."</p></blockquote>
Again, as we do in our Parliamentary electionsâ€”
	<br><blockquote><p>"(5) The worker shall â€¦ fold it so as to cover the marking and deposit it in the ballot box."</p></blockquote>
Further, when the ballot boxes come to be opened,
	<br><blockquote><p>"(6) The ballot papers shall be examined and the votes shall be counted by the persons conducting the ballot."â€”</p></blockquote>
that is, both sides, employee and employer, so, again, there are safeguads to ensure that all the workers have the opportunity, if they so wish, to express their views freely on whether they wish to have safety representatives appointed or not.

Member for Spark-brook, having heard what, I hope, were cogent arguments in support of widening the whole concept, will be able to withdraw his Amendment No. 2, which we feel is far too restrictive and narrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
understand that it is not my wish on any occasion to detain it very long, but, as Amendment No. 2 is the major Amendment in the name of the sponsors of the Bill, I clearly have an obligation to explain what is in our minds and to explain our views on Amendment No. 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Amendment No. 1 were to say no more than that the operation of the Bill would be restricted to companies of 25 rather than 10, we would not, I think, seek to divide the Committee on that. We are anxious to co-operate, although we would not approve of that increase in size. A substantial segment of British industry would be excluded were the figure to go up to 25, and among those smaller companies would be some with the worst safety records in British industry. But, if we are simply arguing about that, I do not think we would seekâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Normanton</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>â€”</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. Hattersley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just said the most co-operative thing that I think I will say during two mornings. I do not propose during two mornings and perhaps one long afternoon to interrupt my own speech by explaining the minutiae of the Committee procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall move on, as what I have said is a ground we should not agree about, but on which we should co-operate. We disagree in principle with the reference to an arrangement for joint consultation which undermines and destroys the principle of the Bill. I know that the hon. Gentleman argued that he believed in the spirit of the Bill and disagreed only with its details. However, to insert into it an Amendment, and therefore a Clause, enabling companies to do less than the provisions of the Bill and to escape the provisions of the Bill destroys it totally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall explain Clause 1(1,	<i>a</i>) to the hon. Member. It says very firmly that there "may" be appointed from among "them"â€”"them" being representatives of employeesâ€”joint safety representatives on joint safety committees. That does not place any obligation on organisations of employees to make such appointments. It does, however, give them that right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While we do not want to force the organisations of employeesâ€”I shall define that phrase more fully in a moment
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
â€”into taking up this obligation, we want to provide them with the obligation should they choose to use it. It is central of our Bill that the workpeople have the opportunity to nominate to such committees representatives who can look after their interests and the provisions for their safety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Holland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Member is trying to improve things. There is nothing in our Amendment which does not give the right to employees to select safety representatives. The right is given in our Amendment to all employees in any factory employing more than 25 people, whereas in the hon. Gentleman's Amendment it is given only to those employees who have been working in a factory where there is no organisation of workers, registered or unregistered trade union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hattersley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a different matter which we shall come to in a moment. There is no doubt that in the hon. Gentleman's speechâ€”and his speech was much fairer to his Amendment than his interjectionâ€”he dealt with the obligations to maintain any existing voluntary arrangements and he referred specifically to Clause 1(5), saying that did not go far enough to meet his point. He said that Clause 1(5), which is the voluntary element in the Bill, was insufficiently voluntary according to the criteria he wished to apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the point I am seeking to meet, because Clause 1(5) allows a degree of scope, of choice, of intelligence, to the work people and to their employers when safety committees are created. As we understand the Bill, any company which has a safety provision involving safety committees and involving the participation of work people in those safety committees which is better than laid down by the Bill will carry on with its own previous provision without let or hindrance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the Bill doesâ€”and this we must insist it continues to doâ€”is to make sure that, where there are no provisions up to the scale and scope of the Bill, the employees, their representatives, or their organisations, have the automatic opportunity to insist on the creation of the committees and the appointment of the representatives that the Bill seeks to set out. I suppose that the philosophical argument between the two sides of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0347">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
Committee concerns the quesion of who should make the nominations, who should decide on the safety representatives, and therefore the employees' representatives, on the joint safety committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My Amendment No. 2 was greeted with a great deal less enthusiasm by hon. Members opposite than I expected. When we drafted that Amendment, it was in an attempt to be conciliatory. Had we wanted simply to draft Amendments which did no more than regularise the legal definition of trade unionsâ€”clearly some change had to be made as the Industrial Relations Act, 1971, made our definition legally inoperativeâ€”we should have done no more than insert words such as, "For the purpose of this Act, the term trade union or unions includes organisations of workers not registered under the Industrial Relations Act". That would not only have regularised the position, but we should have ideally preferred that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should have preferred it because of doctrinal differences between us about the Industrial Relations Act and about the registration of trade unions. I make that point partly because I want it to be on the record that our ideal solution is one which ignores the existence of the Industrial Relations Act. More importantly, I make that point to convince Members opposite that our Amendment is intended not to be fractious, but genuinely to meet the contention made on Second Reading that some redefinition was necessary and that if there had to be a redefinition, there were grounds for including within the scope of the Bill those companies whose workpeople were not organised in registered trade unions, in legally defined trade unions and in T.U.C. affiliated trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our definition, as we are advised and as we understand it, includes registered trade unions and unions that are not registered. It also includes, as we understand it, all those strange organisationsâ€”I will not name any of the companiesâ€”which has a quasi-trade unionâ€”perhaps that is doing them more than justiceâ€”a pseudo-trade union existence. House unions are included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We go further with our definition. We understand that if there is a company with, say, 12 or 27 men which has no union, registered or unregistered, no house union, and whose employees, although they are members of no representative organisation, want to form a
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
safety committee, our definition would include an 	<i>ad hoc</i> coming together in works canteen or scrap yard where the 12 men said, "We are the company organisation which will nominate representatives to the joint safety committee". We are advisedâ€”the Under-Secretary has advantages that we do not possess and I bow to his judgmentâ€”that the definition that is in our Amendment No. 2 is that comprehensive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Holland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member's argument would be more convincing if his Amendment did not restrict the operation of this part of the Bill to places where there are organisations of workers representative of the majority of the workers employed. By our definition, it does not matter whether there is a representative. If more than 25 workers are employed, under our Amendment the Bill would operate. By adding:
	<br><blockquote><p>"representatives of a majority of the workers employed,".</p></blockquote>
the hon. Member immediately restricts it. This is what we object to and this is what we oppose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hattersley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Again the hon. Gentleman misses the point. There is no case where Amendment No. 2 restricts the setting up of joint safety committees and the appointment of selected representatives. Anybody may do that. If they do not have an organisation which is able to make nominations, they may form an 	<i>ad hoc</i> organisation for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 2 restricts the powers to nominate in certain companies. Clearly, if there is a company which has 1,000 employees 890 of whom are members of a trade union, or, if it helps the hon. Gentleman's doctrinal argument, are members of a house union, let us assume that 890 of them are members of the Foreman and Staff Mutual Benefit Associationâ€”not a course of action I would urge upon themâ€”if the organisation is already there, it is the organisation which nominates. The intention of our Amendment is that trade unions should get the first crack of the whip in terms of nominating safety representative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To argue that a company without a trade union has no organisation and therefore cannot have representatives or committees is wrong. It can do it by some sort of 	<i>ad hoc</i> structure. We regard that alternative as preferable to that advanced
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0348">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
by the hon. Gentleman. We know that the Bill has to be amended and therefore the sponsors of the Bill urge the Committee to support Amendment No. 2 and the consequentials, but not to support Amendment No. 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Normanton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have liked to intervene when the hon. Gentleman opened his remarks to say that I was deeply concernedâ€”as I am sure were all members of the Committeeâ€”to hear an observation on which he may be able to help. He said that he might, though very reluctantly, accept a lower limit of 25 and he then said that that would liberate an area in which most industrial accidents occurred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hattersley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Normanton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I heard wrongly, I apologise, but that was the impression I gained. Is there any information to show the distribution of accidents by group or size of organisation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was hoping that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) would say a little more on this matter, but perhaps we can probe his views more deeply as the debate proceeds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I should like to return to the question which I think relevant to the present group of Amendmentsâ€”whether the Bill and the Amendments are appropriate now. I shall not dwell upon it because I do not want to test your patience, Mr. Wallace, but I should like to point out that the hon. Member for Sparkbrook said on Second Reading,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Since the Bill cannot possibly conflict with the Robens recommendations, it should stand on its own feet and should be proposed and supported independently ".â€”[OFFICIAL REPORT, 4th February, 1972; Vol. 830, 	<i>c</i>. 838.]</p></blockquote>
How can he and the Bill's sponsors say that there is nothing in the Clause or the Amendments which could possibly conflict with the recommendations in the Robens Report? He may have some foreknowledge of those recommendations, though I rather doubt that they are as detailed as that. However, it cannot possibly be that the Bill will necessarily dovetail with the Robens Report's recommendations. Had the Government taken steps to ask the Robens Committee whether certain aspects of the Bill were
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
in line with its recommendations, as has been done with previous inquiries when a preliminary report on certain aspects of the problem may have been asked for, it would have seemed sensible for the Bill to go forward. However, if we accept the Clause either as amended by the hon. Member for Sparkbrook, or as amended by my hon. Friends, it will merely bring about a change in the present situation which is bound to be altered within the next year or so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman spoke of "Waiting for Godot": I cannot remember how long one had to wait for Godotâ€”I think that he never turned up at allâ€”but I believe that Lord Robens is never reluctant to turn up and I am sure that his report will appear shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me to be an absolute waste of time for the Committee to investigate in depth a narrow aspect which could well be covered by the Clause and for it then to be ignored. I see that you are becoming restive, Mr. Wallace, so I shall move away from Lord Robens, though that is the main reason for my feeling that this operation is a waste of time and could endanger the credibility of safety schemes in factories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the interesting description given by the hon. Member for Sparkbrook of the meaning of Amendment No. 2. He says that an
	<br><blockquote><p>"Organisation or organisations of workers, representative of a majority of the workers â€¦"</p></blockquote>
can be just a group of people meeting together in the canteen. I think that we cannot accept that such an organisation in order to be covered by the Amendment must be representative of a majority of the workers in a particular establishment. So it would not be right to say that any group of six men out of 25 who met in a canteen would be representative: there would have to be 13 who agreed to come together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I am right about that, we now come to the fact that there must be an organisation which is strictly representative of a majority of the workers. Am I right so far in my understanding of the definition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hattersley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us assume that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0349">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
the hon. Gentleman is right so far, so that he can go on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can take it that I am right in that case. I do not believe that it is right that we should circumscribe the whole issue of safety within an 	<i>ad hoc</i> organisation. I wish to underline the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Carlton (Mr. Holland), which represent what I believe my other hon. Friends feel: safety considerations should be open and should be necessary in places of work, whether or not people are organised. The hon. Gentleman and I have discussed the figure of 25 and I should not mind the figure of 10 being retained, though I am prepared to stick to Amendment No. 1, which specifies a factory with 25 or more persons. However, I believe that these places of work should have over them an umbrella of safety legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the strict sense of the words, Amendment No. 2's reference to the
	<br><blockquote><p>"Organisation or organisation of workersâ€¦"</p></blockquote>
could mean an unregistered trade union. In the light of the hon. Gentleman's definition, one wonders whether, in a small organisation employing, say, 30 people and having three members of a trade union, whether registered or unregistered, those three would automatically be entitled to appoint the members to the safety committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Holland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend misses the restrictive nature of Amendment No. 2. The organisation of workers must be representative of the majority of workers at the establishment. If the majority are not represented by a specifiable organisation, that factory does not come within the ambit of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is confusing me. That was not my understanding of what the hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) said. As I understand it, if it be any organisation or organisations of workers, it may still apply. I wondered whether the promoter of the Bill could give us more information about Amendment No. 2. Would he inform the Committee whether the organisation or organisations of workers must be representative of the majority of workers employed? If he is asking us to accept his Amendment No.
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
2, we must know whether it is essential that they represent the majority of workers. Otherwise, I do not really understand the meaning of the rest of the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The words are, "organisation or organisations of workers". If the representatives must be representatives of the majority of workers, and there is more than one organisation, does it not logically mean that there must be only one union or organisation of workers which represents a majorityâ€”unless it is a kind of committee, say a committee of unions? I may be frightfully dense, but I should like it explained by someone because the hon. Member for Sparkbrook will not help us with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Holland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot entirely agree. My hon. Friend seems to have missed the important difference between the Amendment and the part of the subsection that it would amend. According to the Bill unamended, in any plant or factory where there is a registered or unregistered trade union in the old termâ€”this was drafted presumably, without thought to the new legal definitionâ€”even representing two employees, the union would have the right to appoint a representative. That is much wider in scope than Amendment No. 2, which says that it may happen only where they represent the majority of workers. This is much more restrictive even than the first, and we complained on Second Reading about that being restrictive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember the hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Harold Walker) telling me that I ought not to press the need to widen the scope because he might accept it; and I believe that the hon. Member for Sparkbrook also took the view that they might even accept our attempt to widen it. Now, by their Amendment No. 2, they are restricting even more the operation of that part of the Billâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Is the hon. Gentleman now involving himself in a speech?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Holland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Wallace. I was carried away by my own verbosity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in a rather difficult situation. Amendment No. 2 seems to change the pattern of the Bill much more radically than I had previously realised. Will the promoter of the Bill inform the Committee that it is only where there is an organisation which represents the ma-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0350">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
jority of workers that the Bill applies? If that is the case, we are introducing a new aspect into the Bill, and making it operate only where a majority of workers are represented by an organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the hon. Gentleman help me on that? It makes it difficult for me to continue sensibly if my reading is wrong. But I think I must go on and accept that my understanding of what the hon. Gentleman says is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the case, what happens in both small and large companies? What about a very large company, which may have, say, 20 different trade unions representing its workers, all having separate rights to negotiate with the management on behalf of their members? What is the constituency, so to speak, of the trade union in which it has to have its majority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that there is 100 per cent. union membership in the maintenance department of an organisation employing 100 workers, and that the maintenance department contains 10 workers. Does it mean, if there are several other unions representing the larger number of general workers, who may be doing work which does not involve the same amount of risk, that only the union with larger membership may represent the work people as a whole because it has the majority of those employed? Alternatively, does it preclude the union representing the maintenance workers from having any effective interest in the safety of the maintenance department itself?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the definition Clause, to seek the definition of establishment. I am getting no help from anyone, but it seems that, where the Bill refers to a majority of the workers at an establishment, that establishment is one building or group of buildings. It is a plant. I do not believe that an establishment under the Bill would mean, say, the maintenance department or the toolroom only. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I do not want to get on to ships or docks at the moment; it is difficult enough on dry land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister, with his background knowledge, may be able to tell us what is meant by Amendment No. 2. It would be helpful if he could give us an authoritative definition of "represen-
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall say a few words in a moment and comment on Amendment No. 2, but, with respect to my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be most valuable to the Committee if we could hear the Under-Secretary's views on the speech of the hon.

Therefore, I conclude this part of my speechâ€”there is a lot leftâ€”in the hope that my hon. Friend may give some explanations. I hope that he can do this now, because there are other aspects which must be dealt with later, in particular, the significance of Amendment No. 8. For the sake of logic and order, we should, I think, deal with Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 rather than deal with Amendment No. 8, which covers a separate point. If my hon. Friend can give us some advice on the situation and the state of play at the moment, I shall be extremely grateful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an endeavour to be helpful, I shall speak generally and briefly. The Opposition's attitude to the Bill is well known, and it is known also that there is fairly serious opposition to it among certain of my hon. Friends. This was brought out by the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Carlton (Mr. Holland). There is also some anxiety outside the House, and I have had correspondence about it. I endeavoured to give the Government's view on Second Reading as strongly and clearly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The part of the Bill to which the Amendments are directed is crucial to the whole understanding and operation of the scheme. The Opposition believe that legislation has a definite part to play in the promotion of joint consultation, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0351">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
there are those who dispute this. It is a question of definition, and my hon. Friend the Member for Carlton, in his Amendment, has endeavoured to be helpful. It is by no means a wrecking Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of possibilities for the form which legislation might take. First, there is the Bill before us as drafted, with Amendment No. 2 tabled by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley). The Bill may be criticisedâ€”it has been criticised this morningâ€”on the ground that it makes no provision for workers who do not belong to unions, and it does nothing to encourage joint inspections and the sharing of experience and expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the difficulty of the hon. Member for Sparkbrook with regard to the definition of trade unions or organisation of workers. I shall not go into the doctrinaire aspects that he mentioned in relation to the Industrial Relations Act, but it was quite obviousâ€”he made this clear on Second Readingâ€”that he would have to amend the Bill accordingly. It seems to me, and I am advised, that what he has done is adequate, and I appreciate his motives. But the Amendment would confer the right to appoint safety representatives only on an
	<br><blockquote><p>"organisation or organisations of workers, representative of a majority of the workers employed at the establishment".</p></blockquote>
The Amendment does not resolve the problem of how to provide for joint consultations in works where there are no unions or where the unions do not represent a majority of the workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has endeavoured to be helpful within the context of his Bill and within the philosophy of its presentation. I do not quibble with him on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt the hon. Gentleman heard my hon. Friend's comment that it would be possible to form an 	<i>ad hoc</i> organisation of workers. What is the difficulty about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be. There may be 	<i>ad hoc</i> groups of workers already, but the actual right is not conferred in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be too long; perhaps I shall give way in a moment. I am endeavouring to co-operate with the hon. Member for Sparkbrook in not prolonging my speech. Perhaps my hon. Friend can make his point in his own speech, and I shall seek to interrupt him if I think I can help him. I wanted to develop the argument and not to get bogged down in a long discussion on Amendment No. 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain courses of action are revealed by our discussion of the Amendments. I had mentioned that there is, first, the Bill as drafted. Second, the matter can be tackled by the method in the Mines and Quarries Act, 1954, which provides for workmen's inspectors to be appointed by the union, or jointly by the unions, representing a majority of the persons employed. These inspectors are entitled to inspect every part of the mine or quarry at least once a month. They investigate every fatality and serious accident. I am advisedâ€”I am sure that the hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Harold Walker), with his knowledge, will confirm itâ€”that these powers are widely exercised in coal mines. In 1970, there were 3,650 inspections in 303 mines. That is another possible approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third type of approach is by the means in the first nationalising statutes for the electricity, gas and steel industries. These require that the organisation should be set up jointly with the unions, with machinery for consultation in matters relating to safety, health and welfare. The nature of the machinery is not laid down in the statutes. In fact, safety matters are considered either by separate joint safety committees or by joint consultative committees, which deal with a wide range of subjects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a fourth possibility along the lines of the draft Safety in Factories Order, 1927, but for the sake of brevity. I shall not go into that in detail, although it is closely relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there is the proposal put forward in the Amendments put down by my hon. Friend the Member for Carlton and his hon. Friends. They envisage that, wherever there are arrangements for joint consultations, however ineffectual, no change should be made unless a majority of the employees indicate their dissatisfaction in a ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listended with care to my hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0352">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
Friend the Member for Carlton, but it is by no means clear that his proposals would make a real contribution to the greater involvement of work people and management. They would not promote proper standards of health and safety. although I appreciate that his motives are right. He deals with the question of the ballot. There are great difficulties in operating the ballot under the Order he specifies. Incidentally, the title is misquoted in the Amendment; that is not the official title, but I shall not quibble with him on that. It is a minor point which could be adjusted at some future time. But there would be certain difficulties in relating parts of that Order to the type of operation he suggests. On the other hand, it could operate reasonably satisfactorily in the context in which he envisages it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to try to evaluate today the merits of the various approaches I have mentioned, the merits of the Bill as drafted or the merits of the Amendments suggested by my hon. Friend. I am convinced that the advice which I gave the House on Second Reading was soundly based, and I have not deviated from it, since. We expect to receive the report of Lord Robens' Committee of inquiry into safety and healthâ€”set up, I remind the Committee, by the Labour Governmentâ€”very shortly. I think that that answers the point raised earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. John Page).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Publication of the report will be arranged as quickly as possible. I cannot give my hon. Friend a date, but I think one may say that its arrival is now imminent, a matter of a week or two. I cannot be more specific than that. My hon. Friend would be the last to expect an instant reaction from the Secretary of State or, indeed, from the Government as a whole before they have had a chance to study it in detail. But there will be no dragging of feet on the matter. It will receive urgent consideration by the Administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances, I can only repeat that my right hon. Friend and I wish to have the benefit of the advice which will undoubtedly be contained in the report of that far-reaching inquiry, which covered far more aspects of health and safety at work than the Bill does, admirable though its objectives are. The real
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
question is how best there can be joint consultation on safety. It would have been far better to leave it to the legislation which may flow from the report of the Robens Committee rather than jump the gun with a Bill of this kind, which, of course, has been hanging around now for a long time and, for a variety of reasons, has not reached any advanced stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances, as I said on Second Reading, I cannot advise the Committee either way. I still feel that we should wait for Robens. It is a matter for the Committee and for hon. Members acting in their own individual capacities to decide whether to accept the Amendments or to retain the Bill as it stands. So far as I am concerned, whatever the merits of the two arguments put forward by the respective sides in this debate. I remain of the view that it would be far better to get this absolutely right by waiting for the considered, impartial and independent views which the Committee of inquiry will be putting forward very shortly. In that way, we might achieve far better legislation, which would work more effectively than the Bill before us, if it reaches the Statute Book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall detain the Committee only a second or two longer. The further exposition of Amendment No. 2 given by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary shows that the Bill has been narrowed further still. I am amazed that hon. Gentlemen opposite have supported it. Before the next meeting. I shall seek to see whether it is acceptable to have the Long Title changed, because Amendment No. 2 changes the whole concept of the Bill as it was presented on Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find myself in difficulty now. If my hon. Friend the Member for Carlton (Mr. Holland) misses the point, so do I. As I read Clause 1, there is no right to representation, safety committees and so on if there is no trade union with a majority in factories employing 10 to 100. This puts me in a dilemma. I am not trying to filibuster. This is not a party matter. I want the Bill, properly amended, to get on to the Statute Book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I sought to interrupt my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, I wanted to clarify one point. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hatters-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0353">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
ley) said that there are more accidents in small firms employing less than 25.
<br><br><!-- lb --></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hattersley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At any rate, he said that many small firms have bad records. I do not wish to overstate it. I agree with him. But is it not true that those small firms which have bad safey records are the firms where there are no trade unions? Perhaps my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary can help me on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may well be right, although one does not want to be dogmatic about it. One knows of a number of small firms that are highly unionised and others where trade unions are absent. However. I think that smaller firms are probably less likely to have a strong trade union element, although that does not mean that they are necessarily bad employers or that they do not operate successfully. The individuals working there may well not wish to belong to a union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. But there are also many small firms where the employers are anti-trade union. They are backwoodsmen in that respect, and they are the people who are not really "with it" on safety. The Bill is thus doing the opposite of what I want to do. While I want a Bill embodying this principle, I cannot be party to its going through in this form, especially the part we are now debating. A bad law is far worse than no law at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman opposite would only accept Amendment No. 1, now that we have explained what is behind it, we should be getting on. But if we reach the point where there are no arrangements in factories employing between 10 and 100, or even 25 and 100, and rights are given only to trade unions or organisations of workers, we shall be in trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, what is meant by the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"representative of a majority of the workers"?</p></blockquote>
What happens if no union has a majority? I spent my industrial life in small firms. The firm I have in mind employed 120 to 150 people. There were three trade unions, none of which had a clear majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a pity that the trade unions come into the Bill at all. If the Bill had only been drafted in consultation with people
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
who would bring forward these ideas. I am sure that the drafting would have been satisfactory in the first place and we should not be wallowing in these Amendments. For instance, why could not the CBI be consulted? I am sure that the CBI is as interested in safety as any trade union is and might well have drawn attention to the points we have emphasised. A compromise might have been reached, and we could have been finished with the Bill by now, instead of being still on the first Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Holland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is possible that the CBI was consulted and its advice not taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am assuming that it was not, because, surely, the CBI would have convinced the hon. Gentleman, if we cannot, that it is interested in safety and has in mind the point I have made, that there are firms without trade unions. We have all met the chap who says, "I do not want any truck with trade unions. I run this shop myself". But there are good small firms which take a different attitude. In my small firm, which, I hope, I can fairly claim to have been a good one, I was always trying to get people to appoint shop stewards and the like so that the trade unions would be represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in difficulty because some of us want to help but we are being hindered because the hon. Gentleman will not accept an Amendment put forward in extremely good faith. We must also face the fact that in small firms such as I have mentionedâ€”I am talking about 100 to 150 employees, or possibly a few moreâ€”there is antipathy to formal representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may draw on my not inconsiderable experience, I found it extremely difficult even to get the unions to appoint shop stewards, because nobody was willing to be the shop steward. I could speak at length on that, Mr. Wallace, but you would soon call me to order. I have in mind the time when I actually got a member of the ETU, a woman, to come into my office, and I talked to her for two solid hours, selling her the idea of being the union shop steward. I wanted an ETU shop steward in the factory, and we had not got one. If I had started in that factory to say, "Please will somebody be the safety representa-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0354">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
tive", I should have had a very dusty answer. It was one thing to sell the idea of being a shop steward, but quite anotherâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Normanton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not my hon. Friend underlining the importance of the effectiveness of procedures, whether they are legislative, 	<i>ad hoc</i> or what? Is it not his experience in industry that this is what applies where the employer takes a personal interest in affairs, not because of an organisational requirement imposed by legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the very point I am making. When one is dealing with the sort of firms we are now debating, in the range between 10 or 25 and 100 or 150 employees, there is a close relationship between the board room and the shop floor that one will never find in a firm like British Leyland or ICI. The managing director is in constant touch with the shop floor, very often because he is doing things on it. He is there every day that he is in the factory, and he sees what is going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I was about to make before my hon. Friend intervened was that there was only one safety representative as such in my factory, and it was I. I mentioned the lady from the ETU whom I persuaded to be a shop steward. She was also the first-aid official in the factory. But to get her to use a guard on her drilling machine was almost impossible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Holland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend describe her as "the casual Mrs. Smith"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Her name was Miss Cissie Horne, and she was far from casual. She was extremely rough, tough and to the point, forthright as only a Lancashire ex-millgirl working in the engineering industry could be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are getting rather bogged down with personal reminiscences. May we get back to the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, Mr. Wallace, I am trying to illustrate the difficulty of appointing safety representatives in what we call small factories. The tendency is to think in terms of large companies where there is formality. In big firms, committees, formal representation and so on may be the "in" thing, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
in an organisation with machine shops of several descriptions, paint shops, assembly shops, and the like, representatives can come from the various departments to sit on a committee and be representatives. In smaller companies, where, with respect, there are likely to be no trade unions, official representation of that kind just does not work. If I have strayed too much by talking about Miss Cissie Horne for whom, although she is a member of the Communist Party, I have great respect, I am sorry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the small factory or plant, Amendment No. 2 could lead to merely a kind of lip-service to safety, which would be the exact opposite of what we want. Anybody who has been in the position in which I have been will regard himself as the safety representative in the factory. I say againâ€”I get no reactionâ€”if the hon. Gentleman would only accept Amendment No. 1, we should make some progress. I cannot, in spite of what he said, see any objection to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill as drafted could be applied only to large firms, capital-intensive concerns where there is a great deal of heavy and sometimes dangerous machinery. In such firms, where there is capital-intensive organisation with mass-production, there is the boredom of mass-production, there is a remoteness from the board room, and, perhaps, because of boredom, some lack of attention to safety. But in the smaller companies, although the work is more varied, the machinery may well be more out of date and, therefore, perhaps, more dangerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had it in mind to say something about a rather difficult and old-fashioned shearing machine that I had to deal with, Mr. Wallace, but I had better refrain, though I cannot help feeling that it is valuable to talk from genuine experience in an engineering firm employing just over 100 people. As you would stop me from going into the problems of fitting a guard on that shearing machine, or the like, Mr. Wallace, I can only ask the hon. Gentleman once again: will he please accept Amendment No. 1 so that we can make progress? Amendment No. 2 in his name is restrictive, and is less likely to assist the small companies which he himself has in mind. I cannot quote his words, but I agree with what he says about the bad safety records of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0355">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
some of the small companies, simply because there is not the interest in the matter that there ought to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Normanton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first occasion on which I have had an opportunity to speak, although I have intervened with a number of comments and questions. As I did not have the opportunity on Second Reading, for reasons completely out of my control, which I have explainedâ€”my father was buried on that dayâ€”I hope that I shall be allowed a little licence. I shall do my best to be brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish at the outset to assure the hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) that I support fully and unreservedly any effective measure for achieving what he wants to achieve. Any man or woman who has worked in industry and seen the deadly devastating disasters which can occur and has seen the way people have to suffer their consequences for the rest of their days cannot help but wish to be constructive and helpful. I hope that anything I say will be received by the hon. Member for Sparkbrook in that spirit, because that is certainly how it is intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, however, I must add that I am still to be convinced that the hon. Gentleman's objective will be achieved by the Bill which he is promoting so energetically and in such a nonpartisan manner. I am still to be convinced that any legislation will do it. However, I hope that the Robens Report when it appears, will show the way. We must achieve an improvement in standards of safety on the shop floor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On both the Clause and the Amendment. I am in an almost equal dilemma. I do not like Clause 1(1,	<i>a</i>) for a host of reasons. I confess to my hon. Friend the Member for Carlton (Mr. Holland) that I do not like his Amendment No. 1 either. I am not trying to be destructive. I consider that the phrase "regularly employed" in this context is too loose. It is open to vague interpretation. It would be ineffective in operation, although I am sure that the purpose underlining that choice of words is an attempt to recognise the great characteristic which applies in many firms, and probably more so in the textile firms which I know where we have
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
a large number of people who are employed part-time. "Regularly employed" is not, to my mind, a phrase which could be effectively used as a guide for a factory inspector or some inspecting authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Holland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend believe that "from time to time employed" is any tighter or likely to be more effective, or even as effective as "regularly employed by"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Normanton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am torn between the phrasing at these two points. I do not consider the wording appropriate in either the Bill or the Amendment. Words must be found to deal with the extent to which there are wide variations in numbers of people employed, the period over which they are employed, and the circumstances in which they are employed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next point that worries me seriously is the definition of an establishment. We may turn to other parts of the Bill for guidance and references, but has the hon. Member for Sparkbrook considered building sites in this context. When is a person regularly employed on a building site, and when is he not? Perhaps this question should be put also to my hon. Friend the Member for Carlton. What about ships? Does the Bill cover shipping? Does the Amendment cover shipping? Is an aircraft covered?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not being facetious or destructive. I am asking for guidance, because I come to the Bill fresh for the first time. The original text refers to 10 or more. There are more and more aircraft flying with a crew of not 10 but 20, 30 or 40 people. I ask these questions for guidance, so that, when we make a decision, we do not blind ourselves to certain facts of life in industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does it apply to places of distribution, to shops and warehouses? There are far too many accidentsâ€”small in character but in total seriousâ€”in places which are technically described as shops or warehouses, where goods are handled but not manufactured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about offices? With the increase of machinery installed in offices, would this area be covered by the Bill? It is not heavy machinery of the character of guillotines or presses to which my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, West (Mr. Redmond) referred, but it is just as dangerous, with the high voltages involved and,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0356">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
in certain computer installations, to my amazement, the high temperatures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figure of 10 in the Bill in its original form is totally unrealistic, totally unworkable. It would make the Bill a mere cipher, to be derided and ignored by the vast number of small firms which make up a very substantial part of British industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who is the employer and who is an employee in the context of 10? There may well be the owner, his wife, his daughter, his son, and various relatives working in the firm. They are not members of a union, but technically, I suppose, they are employees. I think it no exaggeration to say that tens of thousands of companies in this country are made up of such family units. Are these to be covered? It will be a complete mockery at the level of 10.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Holland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, they will be covered only if they are represented by an organisation of workers. If they are not so represented, in the majority, they will not be covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Normanton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All right. In other words, do I take it from my hon. Friend that, under his Amendment, a voluntary arrangement would be deemed to exist, and that would be adequate in terms of his Amendment? Is that the way he wishes me to interpret his Amendment? It is certainly not in the text of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the figure of 25 make sense? Frankly, I do not think it does. I suppose, since we are dealing with legislation, we have to put it in as precise a form as possible. One cannot just say "medium size", or "small size" or "large size". So there has to be a number. If one has to put a number I would put it as high as 100. I would not think that too unrealistic. But, to my mind, 10 is quite fatuous, although well-intentioned and, as I say, I regard 25 as far too low.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the question of a ballot. I suppose that there must be some formula for dealing with this point, but I am far from happy about the wording of both the Bill and the Amendment as regards classifying accurately, reliably and consistently the identity of those who would be allowed, or expected, to take part in a ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said all that, I hope that the Committee will accept that I give second place to no one in my wish to make con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
tinuing and constructive efforts to improve safety in all places of work, whether they be factories, ships, aircraft, shops or offices. I deeply regret that I consider neither the Clause as drafted nor Amendment No. 1 an effective way of dealing with the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most effective examples of factory safety are to be found where there is a willingnessâ€”not a Statuteâ€”on the part of both management and workers to collaborate to achieve safety. I know, Mr. Wallace, that you do not wish too many personal anecdotes, but I hope that you will accept that the experience of the cotton and allied industries in the North-West has been extremely relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1928, the employers and the unions got together for the first timeâ€”probably as a result of the 1927 Act to which my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary referredâ€”and formed joint standing committees. We have reached the position where 56 per cent. of all units in the spinning sectionâ€”that is cotton and man-made fibre spinning by the so-called Lancashire processâ€”have safety committees. They are effective and worth while, but they have not been imposed on the employer or the trade union by law. Those examples that are the most effective depend upon individuals. In weaving there is a much larger proportion of part-time employees and a larger number of smaller companies, and we have reached the position where about 30 per cent. of the units are in that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will not feel that I am trying to destroy the Bill or to destroy the objectives underlying the hon. Gentleman's hopes and ambitions. I fully share them, but I do not share them in the form in which we are discussing them today, either in the Amendment or the original text.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Holland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Spark-brook (Mr. Hattersley) has not answered some of the observations put to him. I am disappointed, too, that we have not had contributions from some other hon. Gentlemen opposite who take a keen interest in and are knowledgeable about these matters. I shall not detain the Committee now, because we want to reach the conclusion of this major debate, but I shall make one or two small points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Har-

	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
row, West (Mr. John Page) stressed the need to ensure that the Bill did not conflict with anything in the Robens Report, since that report will come out soonâ€”"Waiting for Godot" and so on. In previous years there has been a lot of waiting for something else to happen, and it never does. But, although I do not agree with much of the rest of what he has said, the Under-Secretary has made it clear that we shall have the Robens Report very soon and that something should result from it in months rather than years. That is something to bear in mind.

Friend said, when she wants to, she may do it on a regular basis and that is all right.

However, we now have to think in terms of committees for small firms. With my not inconsiderable experience of the engineering industry in Lancashire, I can say that it is difficult to organise committees at all: there is a resistance to them. In these formal surroundings, I should not like to repeat some of the language which has been used to me in the past when I have suggested committees: people much prefer to have somebody who will get on with the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thinking back to my own experience, though trying not to reminisceâ€”it is important that if one can, one should speak from experience, trying to relate it to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
proposed legislationâ€”I cannot see that a committee in a works of fewer than 150 people where there is also a safety representative will achieve anything at all. I said before that I regarded myself as the safety representative of a factory. While avoiding the accusation of personal reminiscence, I wish to indicate that the person who was responsible overall to the shareholders for a small factory was at least as interested as anybody else in safety measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Holland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wallace. To help my hon. Friend, who is doing his best, could you allow personal reminiscence in moderation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was a little worried lest the hon. Gentleman should bring in more lady friends. That was the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The lady whom I mentioned, Miss Cissie Horne, was no lady friend of mine, but a jolly good shop steward. I think that I indicated that her political leanings were very far from mine, so she could hardly have been a lady friend. Nevertheless, I had considerable admiration for her.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have indicated that the factory had 120 to 150 employees during the time I was there. The people on the shop floor became over-used to seeing the same machines at the same time, without having the boredom of the capital-intensive mass-production about which we were talking. They were sometimes a little neglectful about putting a guard on a drilling machine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I dare mention the lady again, Cissie Horne was one of the worst, although she was the ambulance woman, as I think they called her in the factory. I was everlastingly insisting that the guards should be used. Some of the workers might have paid me the tribute of being a reasonable sort of bloke in this matter but it is sometimes said that the chap at the top of a factory is interested only in production and does not mind if workers lose a finger, or have their hair caught in a rotating machine and are scalped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are people who believe that there are employers like that. If one is interested in productivity, one does not improve productivity if all one's workers stop because someone is lying in a pool of blood on the shop floor. The hardest

heart of all will want to keep productivity going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Going into the factory daily, one sometimes sees more than the person who is operating the machine the whole time. Let us suppose, however, that in a small factory one has gathered together two or three people and put them on a committee. Who will draft the agenda? What is to be discussed? The chairman of the committee, whoever he may be, will be familiar with every part of the works. He would not have to say that he would try to get into a particular shop in a fortnight's time when passing it. He may go round the whole place in half an hour or so and see what is going on. What on earth will the committee do? I cannot see that anything is achieved by a committee in a small factory, and therefore we are trying to have the minimum number raised to what I think is the low enough level of 150.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been pretty close to the margin, as I said. Anybody in a factory like that, walking round, can be buttonholed by the people on the machines. If someone were to say to me as I was going round the machine shop, "I think that this machine is dangerous; can't we do something about it?", he would have the ear of the person who could do something about it and who would probably call in the chief engineer to put on a guard, for instance. But in fact the opposite happens. It was my experience that I was the one who saw the danger be-
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
cause I was not so familiar with the machinery as the operator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to talk about the shearing machine; we called it the "false teeth". It went on and on, an old machine from about 1900, and the awful thing was that we could not find anything that was better than that machine for doing the job. There were wonderful saws, choppers, guillotines, and the like, but nothing was as fast as this machine. And yet it always looked terribly dangerous to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I designed a guard to put on it; here was I, not the chap who would be complained to, but the chap at the top of the organisation, designing a guard to put on it. The shop stewards came to me and complained about the guard, because it was awkward, and I had to convince them that it was silly to resist having a guard on the machine when the wretched "false teeth" went on moving with no fail-safe and did not stop when the power was switched off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the end, we had to have union representation about that guard. The guard that I designed had a measuring device in it as well, in which case it measured productivity. But let us assume that the workers themselves had complained about the machine, and they wereâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
