	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 75, in page 1, line 6, leave out "one" and insert "five".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no need for me to make a lengthy speech on this Amendment. I have tabled a number of Amendments, and I feel that it would be right for me
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>224</span>
to express my gratitude to Opposition hon. Members for their co-operation in attempting to iron out some of the major differences between us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that in mind, we have tried to redefine "night assembly". We felt that 5,000 was a reasonable figure to select; it is the figure used for the Isle of Wight. It represents a substantial gathering. Five thousand people is more than a casual collection; it is a proper assembly. It was with this in mind that we tabled the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether I would be in order in making some general observations on the Amendment. If I am not, I am sure that you, Mr. Wallace—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think in the circumstances it will be in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin), who has made several substantial concessions, and we should like to put that on record. We think that the concessions are so considerable that they have completely altered the emphasis of the Bill. Our criticisms of the Bill were in themselves substantial and were directed to the fact that the local authority under the Bill as originally drafted had what we considered virtually draconian powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, and having admitted that the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare and the Minister have gone a long way towards meeting our points, I still do not think that the Bill is necessary at this time. I believe that insufficient research has been done by the Bill's sponsor and his supporters and by the Government as to exactly what sort of Measure is needed to give the necessary protection in respect of public health and safety which we should all like to see so far as pop festivals are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My criticism of the hon. Member and the Government is that they allowed a Bill to go forward which, if it had been implemented, would have been a vicious attack upon the right of young people to assemble together. There is no doubt about that. It would have represented a severe diminution of the right of young people to get together, and a severe attack on traditions of liberty in this country and our traditional rights of assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>225</span>
The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare has given way—late in the day—but I am bound to say that had it not been for the spirited and determined attack of Opposition Members, of young people up and down the country, of young people's organisations, of the musical Press such as 	<i>The Melody Maker</i> and the 	<i>New Musical Express,</i> to which I pay tribute, I have a sad feeling that the Bill as originally drafted would have reached the Statute Book and hon. Gentlemen opposite would have been completely indifferent to the attack it made upon our civil liberties and the right of assembly. That is my indictment. Having said that, I shall now be considerate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Crouch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Member for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson) continues, I understand that he wishes to be considerate. I understand the observations he made when he referred to the protestation that has been made by the public about what he thought to be oppressive about the Bill. He said that it is as a result of these protestations reflected by him and his colleagues in Committee that my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare who promoted the Bill has been prepared to give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying so—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crouch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, protestations that have been heard in public. I point out to the hon. Member that that gesture from my hon. Friend is a remarkable move. It is not that he feared that he would not get the Bill, because if he had wished he could have got the Bill through against the wishes of the Opposition. Instead of that, he and Government hon. Members have been prepared to listen. Surely that is the purpose of the Committee. We have been prepared to take note of the protestations made by the public and in the Press. I think that the hon. Member for Accrington has been helpful in that, and I believe that we have not been unhelpful on the Government side.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Crouch) says. I have a high regard for him and we have co-operated on many Bills in the past. But I must stick to what I said. I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>226</span>
know that the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare has given way, but it should not have taken thousands of letters, Press campaigns and spirited leaders, speeches in the House and personal letters to the Bill's promoter, for him and his hon. Friends to realise what many people without political experience realised, that the Bill as originally drawn would have attacked the basis of the right of assembly in this country. I wish to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The tolerance of the Chairman must not be unduly strained. Would the hon. Member please come to the Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not wish to strain the Chairman's tolerance either today or on any other occasion. Therefore, I shall say no more on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's Amendment is a considerable advance on the original figure of 1,000. It is not possible always to arrive at the right figure; some were not acceptable and agreement had to be sought. I accept that 5,000 is not necessarily the figure I would have chosen. Equally, I accept that the hon. Gentleman, by his Amendment, has moved a long way from 1,000. For that I pay tribute to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as some people are concerned, even when half a dozen young people get together in a village it excites and angers villagers. I am thinking particularly of the letter of Mr. James Wentworth Day which appeared in 	<i>The Daily Telegraph.</i> He was objecting to the possible siting of a pop festival in his village near Tollesbury and listed the measures which he and fellow members of the Tollesbury Action Committee were prepared to take if the festival were given permission to take place there. The festival could not have taken place if permission were not granted, and Mr. James Wentworth Day had this to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I think your readers should know that had the festival been held at Tollesbury certain villagers and others from a distance would have taken drastic measures to protect private property from trespass and damage. These included felling trees to block the access road, which are now lying trimmed and ready; barbed wire; tar; shot-gun cartridges loaded with rock-salt and peppercorns; brushwood fires which would have been dosed with asafoedita"—</p></blockquote>
something I have never heard of—
	<br><blockquote><p>"which creates the most appalling stench on earth; three low-flying private aircraft which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0242">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>227</span>
would have dropped flour bombs and soot bombs on the 'musicians'; thunder-flashes;"—</p></blockquote>
and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Angry Brigade had written such a letter, Mr. Wentworth Day and his supporters would immediately have made a demand for the Special Branch to round them up. If Mr. Peter Hain and his supporters had threatened to indulge in similar tactics to stop the South African tour, or to protest against the evil regime now in existence in South Africa, Mr. Wentworth Day and his supporters would have suggested similarly that the police round them up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. No doubt he will agree that if such action were not taken Mr. Wentworth Day would find a Member of this House to promote a Bill to deal with the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are getting very wide of the Amendment. Would the hon. Gentlemen please keep to the argument?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that is very likely. I have no doubt that Mr. Wentworth Day, and other villagers of Tollesbury, has short, neatly-trimmed hair which proves what some hon. Members have said all along, that the length of a person's hair is no guide to good manners or good behaviour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After all, most of the Hitler Youth had short hair. After reading Mr. Wentworth Day's letter, I should not want him and his Hell's Angels to visit my neighbourhood, though I should not employ his tactics to keep them out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ray Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I briefly echo my hon. Friend's remarks. The sponsor of the Bill shows a willingness to amend the figure. Hitherto he had declined to do so, and that had been evident right up to the point when the Minister introduced a report; previously he had said he would not. It is that report, and not letters which hon. Members have received, that has produced a change in the sponsor's attitude. I am still doubtful whether the sponsor should continue to argue his case. It does not seem right, having made an
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>228</span>
agreement which I intend to stand by, that the sponsor should now be allowed to bring forward Amendments which we meekly accept. I hope he will argue his case; otherwise people who pay keen attention to the Committee's deliberations will not view with kindness the activities of the Committee in glossing over and speeding through a revised Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have expressed reservations about other Clauses in the Bill. Perhaps the sponsor would be willing, at an early stage in our deliberations, to indicate whether he is prepared to consider seriously the proposals which we should like to see incorporated. In particular, I am referring to new Clause No. 10, because what he has to say in that connection will condition my attitude towards this Amendment and others to follow. I have no wish to impede progress or undermine our agreement. However, I wish to emphasise that we expect the sponsor to argue his case on each Amendment, and in so doing to persuade hon. Gentlemen on these benches that he is right. Can he also assure us that appropriate changes will be made elsewhere in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I can set at rest the mind of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter) on the question of justification of my Amendments. I intend to argue my case with vigour and hope thereby to convince the Committee of its correctness. Despite consultations through the usual channels, or in this case unusual channels, one or two areas remain where agreement has not been reached. I do not expect discussions, which have taken place outside the Committee, to preclude the possibility of a Division. That is the purpose of Committee proceedings. As to new Clause No. 10, I do not believe the difference to be wide. I am sure that in due course hon. Gentlemen opposite will be convinced of the justification for the way in which it has been tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson) strayed a little from the Amendment when referring to numbers. If I may briefly reply to the point he made there, I hope that what has taken place in tabling these Amendments will be looked upon outside as a sign that we are reasonable people. It is perfectly right and proper that the Committee proceedings of a private Member's Bill—or, indeed, of any other Bill—should allow the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0243">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>229</span>
voice of the people, whether it be exercised through correspondence, in the Press or however pressure might be brought, to see that wrongs or what are considered wrongs are put right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not plead any sanctity as regards writing a perfect Bill in the first instance. The Bill is no more perfect than any other, and it is right that it should be amended. However, it is to be hoped that one message will go out to the young people from what has happened in the Committee. It is quite clear that they have, in the past, distrusted our motives, but they should now realise that their voice has been heard on this occasion, that their perfectly legitimate objections have been considered, that their points have been taken and that the Bill has been accordingly amended. I hope that this will go some way to allaying their fears that we live in a glass house out of which we are never prepared to move and from which we are never prepared to listen to arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to Amendment No. 76. Hon. Members will note that new Clause No. 9 and the proposed Amendments to that Clause are bracketed with Amendment No. 76, but I suggest that for the convenience of the Committee the debate on new Clause No. 9 and the Amendments be taken on the "Clause stand part" debate on Clause 2, together with new Clause No. 8.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that would meet the general agreement of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to move Amendment No. 76, in page 1, line 10, at beginning insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to the provisions of this Act".</p></blockquote>
This is a formal paving Amendment to new Clause No. 9 which I tabled in response to the legitimate complaints that four months' notice can, under certain circumstances, be a grossly onerous burden on the promoter of a night assembly, and can, on occasions, preclude him from holding it at all. Perhaps this is not the appropriate place to go into full reasons as to why we originally put down four months. I felt that two months was about right for the actual physical process, from the date of permission being given to the date of the assembly being held, to carry
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>230</span>
out the requirements of the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my anxiety to see that the appeal procedure could properly be carried out, and without putting into the hands of the local authority the weapon of delay, I felt it necessary to add a further two months to the period, so that the appeal procedure would be properly carried out and resolved and full time given for the organisers to meet the requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it seems that having adopted that view, if the promoter of the assembly is prepared to concur with the requirements of the local authority, there is no reason for the two months' delay for the appeals or, indeed, for any delay if the promoter feels able to fulfil the requirements in the shorter period. The new Clause says that if a promoter does exactly what the local authority requires and selects a suitable site, he shall be allowed to go ahead and the four months' notice which appears elsewhere in the Bill will not be required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This will be a help to promoters who claim already that they concur with the local authority's requirements and to promoters who in the future will learn to do so. When the Bill becomes law it is to be hoped that most promoters will take advantage of this concession. There seems to be no reason why they should not, and if co-operation between them and the local authority begins to build up, this gives them the opportunity to exercise their rights to hold a pop festival or a night assembly of any sort at whatever notice is convenient to them and the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new Clause was introduced at our instigation and I hope that hon. Gentlemen opposite will feel that it is both a sensible concession and a useful addition to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I to understand from your Ruling, Mr. Wallace, that we can discuss this at length during the "Clause stand part" debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said at the beginning that new Clause No. 9 and its Amendments could be taken in discussion with the "Clause stand part" debate on Clause 2, together with new Clause No. 8 and its Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would advise the Committee to take Amendment No. 76 formally and later we can proceed to debate Clause 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0244">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is what I thought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 77, in page 1, line 21, leave out "description and approximate size of the land" and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"acreage and limits of the site".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this Amendment it would be convenient to take Amendment No. 78, in page 1, line 25, leave out "promoting" and insert "intending to promote".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment No. 89, in page 1, line 25, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>bb</i>) the name and address of any person who, as owner or occupier of the land, has given permission for the assembly to be held on his land.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>Amendment No. 90, in page 2, line 3, at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>"and must be accompanied by a copy of the permission referred to in paragraph (	<i>bb</i>) of this subsection".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>Amendment No. 92, in Clause 4, page 3, line 19, after "as", insert "owner or".</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment has been on the Order Paper for some time and is an attempt to define in a rather more practical way the exact location of the site. It is really a formal matter when the notice arrives at the office of the local authority. The district surveyor—or whichever official gets the job of dealing with the application—will presumably have to inspect the site physically, and it seems correct to use the words "acreage and limits of the site" so that he knows exactly where to go and what land is likely to be affected. There is nothing remotely controversial about that one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 78 deals with the question of a person intending to promote the assembly. There could be an instance where a person may intend to promote an assembly and then either changes his mind or has his application turned down. The lawyers have persuaded me that it is better than using "the promoters". It is really a drafting point, and I think should be acceptable to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments No. 89 and No. 90 deal with the question of the occupier of the land. We think it necessary to have the name and address of the occupier on the application, as a necessity, and there is nothing controversial about that. I under-

stand, however, that there are occasions when the occupier is not entitled as such to give permission. Under these special circumstances the owner might have to give the permission—either as well, or as a substitute. Amendment No. 89 merely says that the person who occupies the land shall give his permission. Amendment No. 90 refers to the fact that this permission should accompany such an application—which I am sure the hon. Gentlemen opposite will agree is entirely reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 92 provides for the insertion of the words "owner or". Basically, I am anxious that the owner of the land should not necessarily be involved, since it is the occupier with whom we are concerned. However, as I have previously explained, there are instances where the occupier is not entitled as such to grant permission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we can give a welcome to Amendment No. 77. with respect to size and acreage of land, since this represents a reasonable provision and a substantial improvement on the Clause as originally drafted. Furthermore, I see no objection to Amendment No. 78, which proposes the insertion of the words "intending to promote" and the deletion of the word "promoting".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to Amendment No. 89; I have reservations about how far it is right for us to proceed along the course of including the owner or occupier of land in the requirements of the Clause and of the Bill as a whole. Although I have no rooted objection to the Amendment, some of my hon. Friends may well have objections, and, if it is felt necessary to divide the Committee on this issue, I assure them of my support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no great objection to Amendment No. 90. However, Amendment No. 92, which refers to Clause 4 and seeks to insert in subsection (2, 	<i>c</i>) the words "owner or", thereby including within the catchment of the offences that may be committed under the Bill not only the occupier but the owner—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may clarify this point. It is not sought to involve also the owner, but the owner or the occupier. The owner will be involved only in the event that the occupier is not entitled to give permission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0245">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>233</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I am grateful for that clarification, it does not alter the basic case that I seek to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member will know from our earlier discussions, I am opposed to the inclusion of the occupier, or the owner of land, being involved in the penal Clauses. There are two basic reasons for my opposition. First, I would make the case—as I believe would my hon. Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson)—that this would prove a severe disincentive to owners or occupiers of land from making that land available for the purpose of holding night assemblies. Secondly, it would impose on the owner or occupier a burden of responsibility far greater than that normally involved in the hire of land. For those reasons, I urge my hon. Friends to oppose Amendment No. 92.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to deter the hon. Gentleman from a Division, but he may have missed the point in one instance. I take his point on Clause 4, with respect to the penalties, and no doubt we shall have an interesting debate on that in due course. Nevertheless, Amendment No. 92 refers merely to the person who must give permission for land to be used. Surely the hon. Gentleman would not expect that the occupier of land should not be required to grant permission. This is a fundamental and basic issue, which the occupier as such may have no right to resolve. Thus, provision should be made for the owner or occupier, although one would expect that 99 cases out of 100 would involve the occupier, who may in addition be the owner. However, in the case of certain sub-tenancies under the Agricultural Holdings Act, for example, the occupier would not be entitled to give permission, and it would be necessary to approach the owner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crouch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to comment on the Amendment to which the hon. Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved), while not wholeheartedly objecting, found some objections. I can well understand his reservations, feeling that the owner is merely letting his land for someone else's use, provided that that someone else obtains the authority required by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we should not assume that the person who makes the decision is not a party to what subsequently takes place.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>234</span>
After all, the owner of, for example, land in a rural area, attractively positioned for use as a night assembly—a pop festival—is making a conscious move, being aware of what will result therefrom. Experience has shown that he stands to benefit substantially from the assembly, or pop festival. Therefore, he is a participant and as such should take his place alongside the promoters. His is not a disinterested position; he takes a conscious decision to participate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe, therefore, that the Committee would be unwise to reject the Amendment. It is in no way oppressive. After all, all the other Amendments which we are to consider place a reservation on an authority from withholding its permission, stating merely that if permission is to be given or withheld, the promoters and the owner of the land would be involved together. I think that it would be wrong to disenfranchise the owner of the land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the remarks of the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Crouch) and I do not wish to place the owner of land in a privileged position. Certainly I am not raising objections on behalf of the owner of the land as such. It is my fear that involvement of the owner will make it more difficult for the occupier to agree to allow his land to be used as a pop festival. In other words, he might well think it necessary to obtain permission of the owner—possibly a distant owner, or even a company—who might well dislike the idea of a pop festival and who may resort to an injunction, or other legal proceedings, which he might otherwise not have considered had the legal occupier of the land not sought his permission. Thus, I consider that the provision might prove a considerable disincentive to an occupier who might otherwise be agreeable to allowing his land to be used for a pop festival. I therefore advise my hon. Friends to oppose the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members opposite should consider one further factor. I look upon the word "owner" as a legal formality. The question of whether it is the owner or the occupier is a legal formality. Whether either of them should be involved is the gist of the hon. Gentleman's argument, and I take that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should consider the situation of a totally unscrupulous promoter who comes into a rural district with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0246">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>235</span>
the intention of holding an assembly and who puts in 40 or 50 frivolous applications without having the written permission of any of the occupiers or owners of the land concerned. Amendment No. 89 will prevent that. Amendment No. 92 is merely a tidying-up Amendment to make it satisfactory to the lawyers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important matter and I hope that before we come to a decision we shall have a statement of the Government's view. If an owner or occupier of land in good faith hires it to a promoter, who is also acting in good faith and who intends to conform to the Bill but who, for some reason unforeseen at the time, goes bankrupt, disappears or dies, Amendment No. 92 makes it possible for the owner or occupier to inherit the responsibility for any breach of the law that may occur, although he was an unwitting participant, on the understanding at the time at which he entered into the agreement with the promoter that the Bill would be operated in its entirety and in a satisfactory way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will recall that during the discussions through the usual channels it was agreed that further consideration was to be given to Clause 4. We did not want to reach Clause 4 this morning, so as to allow a few more days to elapse for that consideration. We could then have a quick debate and agree it at our next sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if the Amendment is pressed now, the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) will be in breach of that understanding in relation to Clause 4. It is not an intentional breach, but none the less a breach. Therefore, I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw Amendment No. 92 so that we may have more time to consider Clause 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wallace. The issue which the hon. Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved) has raised is a point of order. You have, quite rightly, included Amendment No. 92 in this group, but as the debate has proceeded, it has become clear that we cannot consider it fully without considering with it Amendment No. 85. May we return to Amendment No. 92 when we are dealing with Amendment No. 85? Personally, I should like to make a statement on it, but it would take me right outside the ambit of Amendment No. 92.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If the Committee decides to take out Amendment No. 92 in due course, I am fully prepared to give an assurance that we would also on Report remove the words "as owner" in Amendment No. 89, to make both Amendments read the same.

	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the most substantial concession that I have made on the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment has the effect of exempting any night assembly that lasts for no longer than 24 hours. I have previously propounded the basic theory behind the Bill and the considerations that I gave to how we should define a night assembly. I said I was prepared in certain cases to take some risks, but not any risk. That comment could well be applied to the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0247">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>237</span>
The Amendment has the advantage of exempting one-night concerts. I was moved by the argument that, if a concert ended at three or four o'clock in the morning, it was asking too much of legislation that those people should be forced out into the highways and byways. If they wish to spread their blankets and spend the rest of the night there, there is no reason why they should not be allowed so to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also my hope that unscrupulous promoters will not take advantage of this Clause. I cannot see how they could. It would mean that a weekend starting on Saturday morning could go on at least until Sunday morning; but if the promoter wished to continue the whole of the following day, he would have to abide by the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would also exempt religious and political activities which the Opposition have suggested might take place. The Clause that I originally tabled to deal with those eventualities was limited to 24 hours. By tabling Amendment No. 79, we automatically exempt those activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have expected some criticism from my hon. Friends of this concession, but they have taken a reasonable view of it. They understand the co-operation that we have received, and I am grateful for their co-operation, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Clause No. 11 is tabled in response to the speech of the hon. Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved) on Second Reading and my assurances on that occasion. The new Clause deals with caravan, camping and scouting activities. Now that the number has been amended to 5,000, there will probably be only one event, the Festival of Lanterns, to which it will apply, although there may be one or two more; no doubt the hon. Gentleman will enlighten me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be few occasions when more than 5,000 people assemble for more than 24 hours, other than for a pop festival, or some new phenomenon not yet apparent. The new Clause is old hat for the Committee, but the Amendment is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this proposal will answer the largest number of my critics and be seen as the substantial concession it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to express my appreciation to the promoters of the Bill for Amendment No. 79 which
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>238</span>
removes the fears expressed by me and some of my hon. Friends about the effects of the Bill on trade union activities, political activities, demonstrations and religious activities. It is a major concession that we appreciate. We appreciate the hon. Gentleman's spirit of co-operation in accepting something asked for elsewhere, and I commend the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret sounding a dissident note. I appreciate how far the other members of the Committee have gone in accepting the Amendment and how far the sponsors of the Bill have gone in producing it. However, it raises practical considerations, and I have certain questions for my hon. Friend the promoter of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my experience, people start to arrive a long time before the festivals begin, and the larger the festival, the longer the period of encampment. If the facilities are not ready—as at the festivals of which I have experience—when those people arrive, the position will be worse than if there was no Bill at all. For a large festival, the ground has been full of people as much as 10 days before it started, but facilities were not provided by the promoters of the festival until the last 24 hours. The ground was foul, broken glass was everywhere, water supplies were in jeopardy—all well before the promoter had said that the festival would start.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How is the Bill to get over this problem if it is to exempt 24-hour night assemblies? There will be problems about when something starts and when it should finish. One cannot do much about the people who camp on the site for a considerable time after the festival finishes. That may be perfectly legitimate and they may be free to do so, but we have to bear in mind that the health hazard remains. The lack of toilet facilities and so on still affects those living in the surrounding countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can my hon. Friend reassure me about what will happen if a promoter gives a time of less than 24 hours for his festival, a large number of people turn up 24 hours before, three or four days before, or a week before, and the necessary facilities are not there? We are laying ourselves open to those living in the area continuing to resent pop festivals, as they do now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is designed to take the steam out of the opposition to these festivals,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0248">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>239</span>
and the Amendment may fail—which means that the whole Bill will fail—to take the steam out of the opposition to pop festivals in rural areas. If a promoter can arrange a festival for a few hours when in practice people are there for 10 days or more and proper facilities are not provided, those living in the area are justified in resenting it and opposition will build up again. At the moment, whenever there is any suggestion of a pop festival coming to an area, there is an immediate reaction against it, and I should like to be reassured by my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen) is stating a problem which no legislation may wholly cover. The Bill is intended to give exemption only where the collection of people stays for less than 24 hours. In my view, the promoters of the kind of event my hon. Friend has described would be committing an offence unless they dealt with it, or—which is probably what will happen in practice—they give notice that the assembly may take far longer in time than the three or four days when the musicians are playing. That would cover the circumstances which my hon. Friend describes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If fewer than 5,000 people assemble, either before or after, no offence is created. My hon. Friend is perfectly right to point out that we have made a substantial concession and that the concession may lead to certain risks. I fully accept that. I have made it clear that my original views on numbers and times aimed at achieving the maximum safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These decisions are arbitrary and we have to reach a sensible compromise, so I have been prepared to give way, but I should not wish my hon. Friend to think I do not look on it as having given way, for I do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) that this is a considerable concession, and my hon. Friends and I regard it as such. Had the hon. Member not made this concession, even with the other concessions he has made, which we are not discussing for the moment, it is doubtful whether our attitude to the Bill would have been as clear as it now is. However, he has made the concession, and has taken out of the Bill much of the menacing and repressive nature of the original
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>240</span>
Clause—a menace to a whole variety of assemblies which it may not have been the intention of the sponsors to include within the Bill, but which none the less were threatened by its provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to give notice to the hon. Gentleman that if we were to feel that the 24-hour period did not completely cover political or religious demonstrations—although at this stage we feel that it does—and if, on reflection and after discussions with the trade unions and religious bodies, it was felt that this did not give the exemption that all members of the Committee want, we might well feel it our duty to table an Amendment on Report. At this stage I believe that the 24-hour period covers the important civil liberties point of the spontaneous demonstration of political or religious bodies which have been referred to 	<i>ad nauseam</i> in the Committee. We welcome the Clause as a considerable concession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join with my hon. Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson) in welcoming Amendment No. 79. Quite rightly, my hon. Friend has given notice that we may have to look at this provision on Report if we are advised that it does not completely cover the matter. However, I think that that contingency is fairly remote. I am sure that the religious bodies to which I have referred previously—the Baptist Renewal Group and the Church Missionary Society, among others—will find that the 24-hour exemption, particularly coupled with the 5,000 figure, will adequately cover their reasonable requirements in their legitimate activities. Therefore, I do not foresee any difficulties in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the fears of the hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen) that the Amendment would make it possible for promoters to circumvent the law by not giving notice because they intend only a 24-hour assembly. As I understand it, Clause 1 (3,	<i>d</i>) requires notice to be given about
	<br><blockquote><p>"the time at which the first of those persons may be expected to arrive and the time at which the last of those persons will be required to leave".</p></blockquote>
If a promoter could be shown to have wilfully deceived the local authority and failed to give notice that it was his intention, by advertising and other means, to encourage people to assemble prior to the 24-hour period, he could have committed an offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0249">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>241</span>
If the promoter has hired the field or whatever it may be for only 24 hours, or a few hours longer than that, the owner of the land has the normal legal rights so far as trespass is concerned before and after the legal assembly held under the provisions of Amendment No. 79.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I understand the apprehensions of the hon. Member for Wells, I believe that it is possible that it might be an offence under the Bill and there would certainly be redress under the normal court procedure on grounds of trespass, albeit it might be a difficult matter on which to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will not be surprised to hear that my main remarks refer to new Clause No. 11, to which I give an unqualified welcome. It will entirely meet my points and those put to me and to the Committee by responsible and well-established organisations such as the Camping Club of Great Britain and Ireland, the Caravan Club, the Scouts and Guides Associations. These organisations may be assured that under new Clause No. 11 they have full protection and have had the burden of the Bill entirely lifted from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) of the new Clause rightly gives the Secretary of State power to withdraw a certificate of exemption granted to any organisation if, for any reason, it should be found to be falling below the standards we are entitled to expect from such responsible organisations. I welcome the Amendment and the new Clause and I hope that the Committee will accept them without a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Woodnutt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the new Clause and the Amendment. Clearly, we had to devise some way of seeing that people were not caught in the net whom we did not seek to catch. This seems to be the only way. Nevertheless, I am still worried about the unscrupulous promoter who will try to find a way round the provisions in order that he may make gigantic profits by not providing what should be provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (	<i>d</i>) worries me. It says
	<br><blockquote><p>"…the time at which the first of those persons may be expected to arrive and the time at which the last of those persons will be required to leave".</p></blockquote>
Does that mean that if the promoter says that they will be required to leave at noon on a certain day and they stay over the time, the promoter is relieved of all
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>242</span>
responsibility if he knows full well at the beginning that he can require people to leave at a certain time, but that they will not in fact leave? Those of us with experience of pop festivals know that they stay for some time afterwards, having their own private pop groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well for the hon. Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved) to say that the landowner has the right to clear them off, or get the police in to move them because they are trespassing, but if there are vast numbers of people, the police are reluctant to do so, because they are afraid of causing commotion, civil riots and other trouble, and invariably in my experience they recommend the owner to wait and let them go peacefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the Amendment and the new Clause, but I wonder whether it would be advisable on Report for the word "required" in paragraph (	<i>d</i>) to be changed to "expected". I believe that it would make all the difference and would cover the point I am making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly undertake to look at the point made by my hon. Friend the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Woodnutt). It is a difficult question and I accept that there are substantial problems about clearing the ground afterwards. I ask my hon. Friend to be satisfied if I undertake to look at the points raised by him and Opposition hon. Members. I prefer not to give an absolute undertaking at this time. Much thought has been given to this problem and an exact phraseology has been decided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crouch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we close the discussion, I should like to remind the Committee how important this Amendment is. A great deal of attention has been paid, rightly, to the Committee's deliberations by the musical Press and the national Press, because the Bill could have been seen to have been oppressive, particularly to young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has also been pointed out that it might have laid difficult rules on assemblies which are not for musical, but for political, religious or other purposes when people need to get together in large numbers for discussions. What we are doing—I make this intervention because it is an important day in the Committee, a day of concessions—is not only to be responsive to responsible representations made to hon. Members generally, but opening up a

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>243</span>
development with which I agree, but which now makes possible a very large night assembly for 24 hours. There are no limits and it is now possible for a promoter to organise a quick assembly, not for three or four days, but for 24 hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be possible to have a massive Bank Holiday pop festival. We should realise that this is the sort of concession that we are prepared to offer, and illustrates the new character of the Bill which my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare is prepared to put forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether I could be of assistance to my hon. Friend the Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Woodnutt) who raised a question about Clause 1(3,	<i>d</i>) and the word "required". Paragraph (	<i>d</i>) deals merely with notice which has to be given: it is not a condition of the holding of a night assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The addition of subsection (4);
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subsection (2) above does not apply to a night assembly which lasts for not more than twenty-four hours."</p></blockquote>
takes that kind of assembly out of the provisions of the Bill. If an assembly is held for more than 24 hours, whatever may have been said in the notice—that is irrelevant to any question of offence—it would be an offence under Clause 4 because it would be an assembly held in contravention of the Bill, and the various defences of Clause 4 would come into operation. If the promoter had taken every reasonable step to prevent it from running for more than 24 hours, he would be relieved of the offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for the Isle of Wight was confusing the provisions of subsection (3) of Clause 1, which deal with what should go into a notice, with the conditions which define a night assembly. Subsection (3) of Clause 1 has nothing to do with the definition of a night assembly. It merely sets out what notice has to be given. If the night assembly lasts for not more than 24 hours, it comes out of the Bill altogether.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I remind the sponsor of the Bill that if
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>244</span>
the proposed changes to be made to the Clause had not been suggested, the Bill would not have become law. It is a cardinal part of our agreement that the Amendments are unchanged throughout the remaining stages of the Bill. Would the hon. Gentleman assure the Committee that in considering the points put forward by his hon. Friends he will not undermine the concession made by Opposition Members, especially on the matter of 24 hours?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman. I am not conscious of having made reassurances along the lines he suggested. I agreed to look at Amendment No. 92 in response to a request from the hon. Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved) and to consider the word "required", as my hon. Friend the Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Woodnutt) requested. Other than that, I have not suggested that the Bill should be amended further than it has already been substantially amended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think I need make a meal of this. Clause 1 is now very different from that originally drafted, and we on this side of the Committee are grateful for that. We should never have agreed to the original drafting of the Clause; it would have been war to the death. Instead of 1,000, it is 5,000; instead of three hours, it is an all-night assembly. It is important that a one-night pop festival may take place without fear, whereas previously it would have been seriously threatened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been keen to ensure that a local authority does not have too wide an overriding power to stop an assembly. However, as that is an argument more appropriate to Clause 2, I shall refer to it again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Arriving at agreement on the Clause is a tribute to the fact that the Committee has a more reasonable understanding of what is involved. However, I feel that that understanding could have been achieved before reaching the seventh Sitting. I concede that it has been difficult to sort out Clause 1, and its major content

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>245</span>
has been virtually redrafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of hon. Members have referred to the Amendments as being a concession. I do not regard them as such. I look upon them as victories for common-sense and, above all, a victory for the young people, those young people who in their thousands have written to us and petitioned us. It is they who have achieved a victory, led by my hon. Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson) who, by the clarity of his speeches in opposition, has inspired not only hon. Members on these benches, but also the young people. I am proud that this should have been done for the Labour Party as well as for the young people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we all break into tears, would not my hon. Friend agree that had we not received those letters, welcome though they were, we should still have opposed the Bill for what it was, a most repressive Measure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodnutt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether we could get matters into perspective. I have heard much self-applause from hon. Gentlemen opposite, but I should like them to remember that the object of a Committee is to sort out such matters. We have done so and for that as much credit is due to hon. Gentlemen on these benches as to those sitting opposite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add one rider. I believe that without a Bill there would be no further pop festivals in this country, for local people would not tolerate them. There is immediately an enormous outcry from wherever a promoter wishes to go, and every possible measure is brought in to prevent it. This is the case at present with Western Festivals. The introduction of a sensible and moderate Bill will give young people a greater chance of enjoying themselves in this manner than in the past. I think my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) has done a great service to young people in introducing a Measure which, rightly, has been hammered out and improved in Committee.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>246</span>
In future, it may be possible to hold such festivals in this country without the deep resentment which has upset my own constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The views of hon. Gentlemen opposite concerning their willingness to approve the speedy passage of the Bill and their conclusion that this is now a reasonable Bill were all expressed during the initial stages of the Committee's deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved) was right to make the point that the present Bill has come about in spite of the Government, the sponsor of the Bill and his colleagues. If my hon. Friends and I had not put up the fight that we have put up, the original Bill would have passed into law. The hon. Members for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Woodnutt) and for Wells (Mr. Boscawen), for example, were most vigorous in their praise of the original Bill. There appears to have been a remarkable about-turn of events and circumstances, in that they now welcome a Bill so dramatically different in almost every respect from the original Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Crayford could have been rather more fulsome in his tribute to the efforts of this side of the Committee and, in particular, to my hon. Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson) who was primarily responsible for my own conversion on this matter. I originally intended to oppose the Bill, root and branch. He convinced me that we should undertake the task in a parliamentary fashion, in order to ensure that a genuine legislative need was met. As a consequence, my hon. Friends and I have worked together to achieve a completely new Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee must only discuss Clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought, Mr. Wallace, that I would not be able to complete a speech without an intervention from the Chair. I would add in passing that quite apart from the subject of night assemblies and pop festivals, I have learned rather more from you on how hon. Members should keep in order during Committee proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think my hon. Friends and I may claim the major part of the credit for the Bill which is now before us. If the pro-

	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 1, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>	<ol>
	<li>The following provisions of this section shall have effect where notice of the holding of a night assembly is given to the local authority under section 1 of this Act.</li>
	<li>The authority, after consultation with any other local authorities, and any statutory undertakers, who appear to them likely to be affected by the holding of the assembly, shall consider—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>whether the site proposed for the holding of the assembly is a suitable one for that purpose; and</li>
	<li>whether, in consequence of that assembly being held, any expenses will necessarily fall on the authority or on those other authorities or statutory undertakers and, if so, the likely amount of those expenses.</li>
</ol>
	<li>If the authority determine that the site is not suitable as mentioned in subsection (2,	<i>a</i>) above, they may give notice to the person intending to promote the assembly, specifying the grounds of that determination and prohibiting the assembly from being held.</li>
	<li>If the authority determine not to give a notice under subsection (3) above, they may by notice to the person intending to promote it require him—
	<ol>
	<li>to take, as part of the arrangements made for the assembly, such steps as the notice may specify with a view to safeguarding the interests of public health and public safety, and to the prevention or limitation of nuisance; and</li>
	<li>to give to the authority, not later than two months before the date on which the assembly is to start, such security as the notice may specify for the expenses referred to in subsection (26) above;</li>
</ol>
but no requirement shall be imposed under this subsection which is more onerous than is reasonably necessary for securing the purpose for which it is imposed.</li>
	<li>A notice under subsection (3) or (4) above shall not be valid unless it is given not later than one month after the giving of the notice under section 1 of this Act.</li>
	<li>Where a night assembly is held in relation to which requirements are imposed under this Act, notices shall be posted at or near every entrance to the site of the assembly, and be kept in position there for the whole duration of the assembly, setting out those requirements (other than requirements as to the giving of security for expenses) for the information of persons attending the assembly and in such a way to be easily visible and legible by them.</li>
</ol></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>and the Amendment thereto: in line 7, after "purpose", insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"having regard to the interests of public health and public safety".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>as well as the Amendment to that Amend-</p>
	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>	<ol>
	<li>The local authority may approve the holding of a night assembly without notice having been given under section 1(2) of this Act if they are satisfied—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>that it is to be held on a site which is suitable for the purpose, and</li>
	<li>either that no such expenses will be incurred as the authority would be authorised to recover under this Act, or that adequate security has been given for such expenses.</li>
</ol>
	<li>An approval given by the local authority under subsection (1) above—
	<ol>
	<li>shall be in writing and relate only to a night assembly held on a specified site (defined by reference to its acreage and limits); and</li>
	<li>shall specify any conditions which have been accepted by the promoters of the assembly with a view to safeguarding the interests of public health and public safety and to the prevention or limitation of nuisance;</li></ol>
and compliance with any condition so specified shall be a requirement imposed under this Act with respect to that night assembly.</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>

<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0253">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>249</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In effect, we wish to discuss the question that Clause 2 does not stand part of the Bill, and I hope that the Committee will agree in due course that that is the correct means of procedure. We propose that new Clause No. 8 should be substituted for Clause 2, and would in due course occupy the same position in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair to say that this Clause, whether Clause 2 or new Clause 8—they are basically very similar—empowers a local authority, having taken account of the code of practice, to lay down requirements on the organiser of the assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not necessary for me to mention every subsection of the Clause. I shall confine my speech principally to the question of the power of the local authority actually to prohibit the holding of a night assembly, since this is an area in which hon. Members opposite disagree. Amendments to that effect have been tabled by the hon. Member for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson), to which I have in turn tabled a sub-Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The authority, … shall consider—
	<ol>
	<li>whether the site proposed for the holding of the assembly is a suitable one for that purpose;"</li></ol></p></blockquote>
while the hon. Gentleman's Amendment states that the local authority should take into account the interests of public health and public safety when assessing the suitability of the site. If that Amendment were to be adopted, I should wish to add that account should be taken of the degree of public nuisance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must decide exactly what it is we are trying to achieve. When, in due course, we debate further new Clauses, we shall come to the question of the code of practice, which, I think, is germane to the agreement which we have reached on the Bill. It seems to me right and proper—and I hope that the Minister will confirm that this will be the case—that the code of practice should include provisions as to the suitability of the site dealing with health, safety, nuisance, as well as other factors which may not occur to us during these proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Accrington, in moving his Amendment, will consider whether or not it would be desirable to limit the local authority in this respect any more than it would limit the promoter. If we intend to adopt the flexible and amendable system of a code
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>250</span>
of practice, which has been agreed upon as the best way of dealing with this question, it would be wrong suddenly to single out the suitability of the site and try to write it into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that hon. Gentlemen opposite will ask me to furnish examples where such a situation might arise. One example which comes to mind is that a site might be selected adjacent to a mental hospital—such hospitals are often found in the countryside—where it was proposed to hold a night assembly next door to such an institution. In the interests of public health and public safety, the festival might be held. However, in the interests of the patients and staff of the institution it would quite clearly be undesirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similar circumstances might arise with regard to convents, schools or maternity homes—it is impossible to enumerate all possibilities. However, I think that to limit a local authority to rejecting a site solely on the grounds of public health and safety might be undesirable. Hon. Gentlemen opposite may argue that any site may be considered to be unsuitable by a bigoted and biased local authority. They may conjure up any number of reasons why a certain field should be rejected, or a certain area should be rejected. If the code is to work at all, a reasonable view must be taken. Ultimately the protection of the common sense of the Secretary of State is available, through the appeal procedure, to the promoter. I am anxious not to prejudice the code by writing too firmly into the Bill the considerations that should be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rest of the Clause concerns principles with which by now we have become fully familiar, even though we have not discussed them in great detail. They are the powers of a local authority to consult with statutory undertakers, the laying down of requirements that will be necessary, and providing the necessary figures for security purposes. This is the active Clause in the Bill; it allows local authorities to move.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have added provision for the erection of a notice at the entrances to sites. It is desirable to ensure that everyone employed in connection with the assembly and those attending should be aware of the conditions upon which it has been permitted to be held. Since, later in the Bill, we penalise those who do not comply with these requirements, and because it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0254">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>251</span>
a well-established principle under National Insurance Acts and safety regulations that a notice should be exhibited, I thought it necessary to include the subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important part of the Bill, and it is clear what the Clause lays down. The interpretation of it is not difficult. For those reasons, I commend the Clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has all along been a criticism of the Bill by this side of the Committee that it gave far too wide powers to local authorities to prohibit the holding of a pop festival or any other assembly. It is only because the Minister belatedly spoke about a code of practice being binding on local authorities that we have now taken a different view of the Bill. Although it becomes a different Bill, I know that we cannot debate the code of practice on this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel strongly that new Clause 8, as drafted, gives far too wide powers to a local authority. The inclusion of the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"having regard to the interests of public health and public safety"—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member may make reference to the code of practice, but he must not go into it in detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I make reference to it, I am bound to go into some detail. Therefore, I think it would be better if I left this matter until a later occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without the inclusion of the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"having regard to the interests of public health and public safety ",</p></blockquote>
as the hon. Gentleman said I would say, any bigoted council subject to the sort of pressures that the skinheads at Tollesbury brought about could think of almost any frivolous excuse for refusing permission for saying that the land was not suitable. I ask my hon. Friends not to accept new Clause 8 but to accept my Amendment if the hon. Gentleman is not prepared to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman give way? Would he not consider it more sensible if we divided on his Amendment, rather than reject the whole of Clause 8?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I agree with the hon. Gentleman. I think that is a sensible suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why I cannot accept his Amendment to my Amendment is that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>252</span>
this is a Bill about public health and safety. If we widen it we will defeat the object of the Bill. It is not a Bill about nuisance; it ensures that facilities at pop festivals are suitable for the people who attend them. If we do not include these words, I am convinced that the code of practice will be flouted. A bigoted local authority, hostile to the mere thought of young people coming to their sacred village, could well arbitrarily stop a festival on frivolous grounds, or for no other reason than malice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman would think about this. We are so much at one on the rest of the Clause that he might perhaps reconsider the effect of restricting the decision of a local authority in the way that he suggests. That decision is fairly well restricted by the wording of subsection (2,	<i>a</i>) of new Clause 8, because it refers to the site proposed. The suitability must be in reference to the site, and not in reference to some policy of a local authority unrelated to the proposed site. It is to that extent restricted. I do not think that a local authority could get away with some refusal on grounds which are not entirely related to the proposed site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman restricted the decision of a local authority by the inclusion of the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"having regard to the interests of public health and public safety"</p></blockquote>
or even with the addition of my hon. Friend's words
	<br><blockquote><p>"the degree of nuisance that is likely to be caused",</p></blockquote>
he would fail to take into account matters of access, which are not directly matters of public safety; matters of access are more matters of convenience rather than safety. He might exclude consideration of such things as tree preservation on a site, ancient monuments—perhaps even Stonehenge itself. These things are directly related to a site, and to refuse permission on their account would certainly not be considered to be an eccentricity on the part of a local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has already mentioned property adjacent to the site, such as hospitals, places of religious worship, and radioactive equipment such as a telescope. One must take into account the situation of the site in relation to other property. This would not come under any of the proposed provisions for public
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0255">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>253</span>
health, public safety or nuisance. I should have thought from the wording that it was the site which had to be considered as to suitability, not any remote ideas of the local authority, and that we ought to leave the matters to which the local authority must have consideration when looking at the suitability of a site wider than the terms "public health", "public safety", or "nuisance".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the Minister has said, I advise my hon. Friends not to vote on this occasion, but again I give a warning—if I may use that phrase to the Minister—that if we are not satisfied, on reflection, it may well, be necessary for us to put down a similar Amendment, or an Amendment covering these points, on Report. In view of what the Minister has said, I shall ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had better clarify the situation. We are to vote only on Clause 2. We are to vote on the Amendments and new Clauses in the order of sequence, probably next week, all being well. They will be moved formally and votes taken, if desired.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At that late stage, my hon. Friend will still have an opportunity of withdrawing the Amendment if he so wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, or of not moving the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The power of local authorities has been a source of considerable disquiet and I still have considerable doubts about the powers to be granted to them. The sponsor referred to the code of conduct or practice. New Clause No. 10 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…neither the local authority nor the Secretary of State shall in relation to a particular case be held to conformity with any particular provision of the code."</p></blockquote>
That leaves a local authority with extremely wide terms of interpretation which it is possible—and I do not wish to get involved in a nit-picking argument in view of what the Minister has said—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must not anticipate new Clause No. 10.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult when talking about the code, which has already been
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>254</span>
introduced, not to anticipate. There is a reference in new Clause No. 10 to the new Clause that we are now discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member may carry on. I will try to be sympathetic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is breaking fresh ground!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the new Clause stands, it leaves local authorities with an enormous area of discretion which could be used by an unwilling local authority to frustrate the intention of the Bill. The Minister and the sponsor must make out the case that local authorities will not act in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have considerable reservations—as I expressed in a more amenable atmosphere in another place—about the powers that local authorities will have under new Clause No. 8. It is a central issue and I ask the sponsor to look particularly at the last part of new Clause No. 10 as it affects the code of practice, and assure us that it is not his intention, nor the Minister's, to leave such wide powers with local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, if they accept my point, they may come back on Report with Amendments to meet it. Failing that, I am bound to say that on Report I shall have to adopt a hostile attitude not only to this provision, but to the whole Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about something fundamental to the Bill. The power that is vested with local authorities could subvert all our deliberations, the Bill and its intention. Unless the sponsor and the Minister can answer satisfactorily on that point, there would not only be doubt, but severe scepticism on our part about producing a Bill to safeguard the rights and liberties of people wishing to organise pop concerts, fetes, and similar events.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has largely convinced me that new Clause No. 10 has relevance to this debate, and I am prepared to allow it to be mentioned within reason.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we may discuss the hon. Gentleman's problem when we get to new Clause No. 10. I understand his fears fully. I cannot give any assurance that local authorities will

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>255</span>
not unreasonably use new Clause No. 8 in the first instance to try and prevent the holding of a pop festival. That is why we have gone to such lengths to see that the appeal procedure will protect the innocent organiser against an unreasonable local authority. In the same way, I cannot give any assurance that promoters will not be unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we come to new Clause No. 10, I hope to convince the Committee and the Minister that not only will the local authority be forced into a reasonable attitude, but the person hearing the appeal will have to consider the code. We should be haring up the wrong path on new Clause No. 8 to debate this matter now. As I said earlier, the question is whether we should limit a local authority's reasons for refusal, and I am grateful to the hon. Member for Accrington for indicating that he accepts the argument at this stage. Equally, I accept that we shall have to convince him when we debate the code of practice that this matter will be dealt with under that code of practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make it clear that I do not think that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) said about appeal is not strictly germane to the argument, but it follows on from the power of the local authority to say, "No" to any pop festival, or other event which people may wish to promote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member answers, logically, that there are adequate powers of appeal, but he must accept that for a large number of small organisations, particularly charitable organisations, telling them that they have the right of appeal in no way assists them. This clearly demonstrates that there are barriers to overcome. An appeals procedure is instituted because there may be recalcitrant and unreasonable local authorities, and many small organisations, especially if they have to take legal advice, would be dissuaded from appealing because of the trouble involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a wholly adequate answer for the sponsor of the Bill to say that appeal is possible. It could involve small organisa-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>256</span>
tions and smallish events in considerable expense that they could not bear if there were a possibility of an appeal eventually being turned down by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member should bear that in mind. It is all very well for the large promoter, like Western Pop Festivals, but the bulk of organisations are smaller, and for them the appeal procedure is not necessarily the form of protection which the sponsor of the Bill has tried to convince us that it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 81, in page 2, line 41, leave out from beginning to "and" in line 42 and insert:

	<p>No. 83, in page 3, line 2, leave out from "concerned" to "those" in line 3 and insert "any associated expenses of".</p>
	<p>No. 84, in page 3, line 5, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>(2) In this section references to associated expenses of any authority or undertakers are to expenses necessarily incurred by them for the purposes, or in consequence, of the night assembly, including expenses incurred at the request of the promoters of the assembly.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Clause is to do with the recovery of expenses by the authorities concerned. There are some complicated legal definitions—what is an authority, what is a local authority—which are germane to what we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 82 is to prevent expenses incurred by a police authority from being recoverable. This seems appropriate since all other matters relating to public order of night assemblies are outside the Bill. Police authorities as constituted by the Police Act, 1964, are not local authorities, and the insertion of "local", as proposed in the Amendment, will produce the desired effect. A casual reader of the Bill would not have reached that conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A local authority might incur two kinds of expenses in the event of a night assembly being held in its area. The first is the expenses incurred by local authorities and statutory undertakers in the pursuance of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0257">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>257</span>
their statutory functions, and the second would be expenses incurred at the request of the promoters. For example, the promoters might ask for a road, or an entrance, and they would expect to pay. I believe that to be outside the terms of the Bill. It is a normal business contract and it is not my concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the first instance, however, where a local authority says that it will require something to be done, and does the work on behalf of the promoters, that is fulfilling an obligation as a result of a statutory requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 84 deals with the first of my two cases and would ensure that only:
	<br><blockquote><p>"expenses necessarily incurred … for the purposes, or in consequence, of the night assembly…"</p></blockquote>
would be recoverable. Expenses incurred at the request of the promoters would be recoverable under Clause 3, but it should be noted that security for them could not be taken under the provisions of new Clause No. 8. The local authority could ask the promoters to pay in advance, or otherwise treat the matter as a normal business deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are no other major points. The matter is technical. The question of the police has bothered many people, but if we were to introduce the extra costs of policing for large assemblies, all kinds of questions would present themselves—football matches, race meetings, daytime assemblies and so forth. By redrafting the Clause, the matter is now clarified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Clause is better than it was. We on this side were most concerned that local authorities should not ask for expenses that were so unreasonable that they would prevent an assembly or a pop festival from taking place at all. We were anxious that there should be some strict limitation on the type of expenses that could be claimed. It would be wrong for a local authority that wanted to build a monument or a building which it claimed</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>If the hon. Gentleman assures us that it will be only those expenses, and limited to those expenses, we can take an entirely different view of the Clause.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always reluctant to give assurances, because I am not a lawyer, but I can explain that the Clause originally said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the expenses reasonably incurred by "—</p></blockquote>

	<br><blockquote><p>"in connection with…".</p></blockquote>
It was argued that this was not sufficiently watertight. We took that point. The phrase in the Amendment is a tighter definition and meets the hon. Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
