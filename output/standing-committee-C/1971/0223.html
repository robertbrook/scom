<p><i>Question proposed</i>—(<i>16th February</i>)—That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p>10.33 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Finsberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I had been making a political speech, I should have committed the cardinal error of coming to a conclusion and allowing an enormous pause to elapse after the words "I think", which would give every conceivable heckler the opportunity to insert some very odd remarks. But, on this occasion, I think that the week has proved a very useful gap. Certainly, it has given me time to re-read the speeches which have been made since the start of the debate on Clause 1.<br><br>
I cannot see why some hon. Members have got somewhat heated as a result of a decision of the Committee, on a vote of seven to four, on a certain Amendment. The hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse), expressing genuine fears, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I hope that those who are responsible for this"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the Amendment which was carried—
<br><blockquote><p>"will, in order to save the Bill, be ready on Report to make certain that it is in a form identical to that intended by the sponsor or, if the safeguard about the age of 30 is left out, will reinforce and supplement its provisions by the circular which the Minister has in mind."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee C,</i> 16th February, 1972; <i>c.</i> 129.]</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell), referring to the Minister, said:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 144</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister shook his head in defence of what my hon. and medical Friend'—</p></blockquote>
that is, the hon. Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford)—
<br><blockquote><p>"had said, apparently agreeing with what he was saying and disagreeing with what I am saying. I ask him to think very carefully before he dreams of giving me a reply to the questions I wish to put to him."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee C,</i> 16th February, 1972; <i>c.</i> 133.]</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Barkston Ash (Mr. Alison) has had time to think, although I do not believe that he needed it, because he appeared—as clearly as anything I have known in 20 years of public life—to indicate that he was not particularly worried by the fact that the Amendment had been made.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Yarmouth, then said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I will leave basically as read "—</p></blockquote>
the words of the hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse)—
<br><blockquote><p>"so that the Minister may have time to reply on the question of the amended Clause and to the serious situation which now faces him in view of his earlier promises to the Committee."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee C,</i> 16th February, 1972; <i>c.</i> 134.]</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt my hon. Friend, but he would not want to have it wrong in HANSARD. He spoke of the hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) in his second reference.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Finsberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is correct. It is col. 134.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But that was the hon. Member for Yarmouth, myself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Finsberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall repeat what I thought I said. The second quotation was a reference to the hon. Member for Pontypool, made by my hon. Friend the Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell). If I did not make that clear, I apologise. I repeat the quotation:
<br><blockquote><p>"… so that the Minister may have time to reply on the question of the amended Clause and to the serious situation which now faces him in view of his earlier promises to the Committee."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend's earlier promises were on the question of a Circular. I do not intend to detain the Committee for long on this. I hope that the Minister will intervene fairly swiftly to reinforce, I hope, my impression and to dispel any doubt which may linger in the mind of any hon. Members that the Clause, as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0085">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 145</span>
amended, is unacceptable or dangerous so far as he is concerned. I hope that he will be able to tell us that the Government still maintain a position of benevolent neutrality on the Clause.<br><br>
I can see no difficulty in the Committee going ahead and concluding its consideration of the Clause as amended and proceeding to the other fascinating Clauses of the Bill, before coming to the even more fascinating new Clauses. What are the main anxieties? The main anxiety is the removal of the age limit. The circular can still cover that particular point, because those of us who have had any experience in local government will know that a ministerial circular can cover as much or as little as a Minister or Ministry intends. My hon. Friend the Member for Barkston Ash and the hon. Lady the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) will confirm that ministerial circulars are able to convey to interested bodies, such as hospitals and local authorities, what the Minister and the Ministry intend to happen. I have not yet known a ministerial circular to be other than effective. Everyone knows that if the provisions of a circular giving clear and helpful guidance are disregarded by recipients, the Minister has many other reserve powers by which he can intervene and bring to heel a recalcitrant local authority. All the safeguards which hon. Members genuinely desire, can be achieved by the particular Circular.<br><br>
I think it is worth recalling that there may be some young men under the age of 30 who might have progressive or hereditary disease and might desire to have a vasectomy. If medical reasons are adduced, on those grounds they could almost certainly have a vasectomy, not through the local authority but by going to hospital. None the less, the Clause as it now stands is none the weaker for relying upon ministerial circular. I do not think that we have opened the floodgates, and I believe that the effect of the amended Clause is to leave things as they were, except to provide for flexibility and for the good common sense of local authorities. I am sure that no one will say that local authorities do not exercise common sense. In the background are both the safeguards of ministerial circular—about which I hope that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 146</span>
my hon. Friend will say something in a moment—and the reserve power that, if it is shown that there is disregard, it is possible for the Minister to take further action.<br><br>
I am not sure whether you would think me out of order, Mr. Fitch, if I were to add that, because I believe that the circular is the right and safe method of proceeding now that we have reached this stage, I confidently envisage that the figures and statistics which would be needed to show whether the circular was effective would be gathered and presented if new Clause No. 3 were accepted by the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Sinclair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very content to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead (Mr. Geoffrey Finsberg). I am closely in agreement with the argument he has advanced on this rather difficult Clause, as now amended. As one of the sponsors of the Bill, I wish to clarify my position in suggesting that we enact Clause 1 as now amended.<br><br>
My reason for supporting the Amendment No. 2 in the name of the right hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) was a logical extension of the feelings of my hon. Friend the Member for Barkston Ash (Mr. Alison) and of the sponsors of the Bill, that some safeguards are much better imposed by Departmental circular than by inclusion in the statute itself. Like the hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead) and the hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse), I trust that the Minister will be able to assure us, if possible before we vote on the Clause, that a future circular will set a high standard for counselling before and after vasectomy.<br><br>
I hope that he will be able to tell us that the guidelines will include, unless there are exceptional circumstances, that the patient's general practitioner should be consulted, a basic safeguard paying regard to his common sense and knowledge of the family, that there should be screening for physical and psychiatric contra-indications; that the man should be living in a stable union and have the consent of his wife or partner; that there should be two or more children of that union; and that the man should be of a mature age, perhaps accepting the age of 30 as a general guide. Furthermore, there should be a standard for follow-up medical examination after the operation. If
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0086">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 147</span>
the Minister is able to help us in this way, we need have no doubt about voting for the Clause.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
My chief reason for feeling that these standards should be set by circular rather than by statute is that there are bound to be a fairly large number of cases in which one of these standards could not be compiled with. For example, there will be the general practitioner who objects to family planning for religious reasons. There will be health reasons in the husband or wife. There may be cases of early marriages with many children. One case—I am not sure whether it has already been cited in the Committee—recently reported in London was of an unemployed man aged 27 who already had seven children. Doctors must be able to use their clinical judgment freely in particular circumstances. The standards can be only for general guidance, therefore, and I believe strongly that general guidance has no place in the Statute Book.<br><br>
To sum up, I do not feel that the Committee amended the Clause to the form in which it is now being debated in order to make the operation widely available to very young men. That had nothing to do with the way I voted, whatever a young man's reasons for seeking vasectomy may be. The general intention of the deleted age limit for males is better implemented by Departmental circular, which has the great advantage of easy revision if new situations arise. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Barkston Ash will be able to assure the Committee and, at a later stage, the House, that the Department is planning a circular along the lines I have suggested.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Laurie Pavitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Gentleman, I support the Clause. The Committee has made a vast improvement by the Amendment. Although I put my name to the Amendment, I did not speak to it because it was adequately covered, and I did not want to add to the verbiage of our debates at the last two Sittings, I want now to take up only one point.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman the Member for Dorking (Sir G. Sinclair) asked that the Circular should cover the important matter of consultation with the general practitioner, and then he almost qualified it rather as I wish to qualify it now: anybody who knows the working of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 148</span>
parent Act knows that there are areas where it is difficult to get an objective view even from a person so clinically qualified as a general practitioner. The family doctor is the kind of person one would automatically wish to call in for consultation on questions of this kind. Nevertheless, that would have to be taken into consideration by those who may have to operate the Bill under a local health authority.<br><br>
The work load of the average general practitioner creates problems. His number of patients may be as many as 3,600, but the average throughout the country is about 2,400. The average number of appointments is five per patient per year—and twice as many for the over-65s, who will not, of course, be affected by the Bill, and twice as many for the under-fives, who also will not be affected.<br><br>
Every time the House seeks to give additional responsibility to the general practitoner service, it lays an extra responsibility on the Department to find the ancillary team work behind that general practitioner so that he will have sufficient time to do his job. In considering the safeguards we are up against the question of priorities in relation to the medical men needed to implement Clause 1. There are many priorities, which, were I to be in the unlikely position of being Under-Secretary of State and having to make decisions about the allocation of manpower, I should have' to take into consideration.<br><br>
When a Committee has a Bill before it, it inevitably concentrates on the one particular problem. But the hon. Member for Barkston Ash is not in that position. He has to consider the way in which he dispenses a comprehensive service over the whole community. Therefore, I can understand that the guidance he will give in the circular—there are thousands issued—will be broad and seek to cover the fears expressed by hon. Members. At the same time, he must consider the totality of the local health service.<br><br>
I wish to reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead). It may be thought that he has leaned over backwards in an effort to placate the critics of the Bill and to show that he has a responsible attitude. I do not think that he needs to. He has already revealed his responsible attitude, both on Second Reading and in his contributions
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0087">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 149</span>
to this Committee. It is impossible to placate the hon. Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell), for instance. One may appease him, but at the end of the day nothing will have been gained on this Clause or on any other, for the simple reason that he is adamant against all the Bill. Therefore, it is, perhaps, a waste of time to try to appease the hon. Member for Yarmouth. The position of my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) is different. He supports the Bill and seeks to have the necessary safeguards. Obviously, his approach is different from that of the hon. Member for Yarmouth.<br><br>
The Clause is essential. It is the essence of a very small Bill. I hope that the Committee will soon pass it and get on with the rest of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Willesden, West (Mr. Pavitt) has addressed the Committee with his usual moderation and a great deal of authority. I thought that he spoke with undue modesty, for if he thinks that it is a good Bill and that this is a good Clause in it, he ought to feel that he might be able to persuade my hon. Friend the Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell), who is a reasonable man open to honest, sincere and informed argument.<br><br>
It seems that there has been a sort of psychological power cut in the Standing Committee, so changed is the atmosphere from what it was last Wednesday. At that time, there was confusion, perturbation and consternation on the part of the hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead), the sponsor of the Bill. My hon. Friends the Members for Hampstead (Mr. Geoffrey Finsberg) and for Dorking (Sir G. Sinclair) were in doubt as to how they should vote on the crucial Amendment which has transformed Clause 1. They went into a huddle. They were worried by what was happening. Yet they decided that they would vote for the Amendment. But they must have cast their votes for the Amendment with considerable doubt and anxiety. I am not certain that, if they had thought out what they were doing, they would not have voted with us against the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Finsberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am gratified that my hon. Friend was able to discern what was in my mind when I voted. I should not attempt to diagnose what is in my hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 150</span>
Friend's mind. That is a matter between him and his psychologist, or between him and his conscience. I should not like to try to say what was in his mind. I assume that, when he takes a decision, he is fully conscious of what he is doing, and I should have thought that he would assume that others would do the same.<br><br>
May I add a word of apology now? I may not hear what my hon. Friend the Minister has to say because I have to attend a Select Committee at 11.0 a.m.—though I shall be back if a quorum or a vote is needed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I quite understand if my hon. Friend wishes to leave the Committee. Of course, I accept what he says about his mental processes. We shall leave each other to our respective mental processes. I do not wish the proceedings to be prolonged by undue interruptions.<br><br>
I was commenting on how different the situation in the Committee is this week from what it was last week, when there was considerable heat and considerable confusion, too. Now, we have had three charming speeches from my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead—to whom we are about to say farewell for a time—from my hon. Friend the Member for Dorking and from the hon. Gentleman the Member for Willesden, West. They positively purred with contentment. Everything is for the best in the best of all possible Bills. It seemed to me that they were really trying to vasectomise the debate and bring matters to a conclusion. They asked us not to worry—it does not matter what is in the Bill, one can write anything into the Bill because it can all be put right by ministerial circular. I am most surprised. We have had great arguments in the Chamber about the effect of British membership of the Community upon our Parliamentary processes here, yet here in this Standing Committee we are told that we need not worry how we legislate, or how the Bill comes out and is reported to the House, because everything can be put right by the Secretary of State.<br><br>
I have the fullest confidence in my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. He is the best we have had for a long time. However, one Secretary of Slate succeeds another, and one circular can replace another. On a grave matter of this kind, he would be most unwise to depend on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0088">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 151</span>
everything wrong in the Bill being put right by ministerial circular.<br><br>
The insistence by the hon. Gentleman and by my two hon. Friends on the importance of the circular shows how uneasy they are at the Amendment which has radically altered Clause 1. My hon. Friend the Member for Dorking had all kinds of helpful and useful ideas about what my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State could put in the circular—about the importance of counselling, for example. I notice that he did not take part in our debates on counselling. I do not think that he supported the Amendment of the hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) to secure effective counselling. He suggested, however, that a provision about counselling could be inserted in the circular. He mentioned screening. He spoke, ironically perhaps, of a stable union—stability is the aim of the Bill—and he spoke about having children prior to vasectomy.<br><br>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
Then my hon. Friend the Member for Dorking said that he thought 30 was a proper age before which vasectomy should not be carried out. He said that the age of 30 should be taken as a general guide. In other words, he would have preferred the Clause as it stood, as the hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead) wanted it to be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir G. Sinclair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps, I should remind my hon. Friend of what I said: the man should be of a mature age, perhaps accepting 30 as a general guide.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. With respect to my hon. Friend, that is what I tried to say. I did not write down his words; they will be immortalised in the OFFICIAL REPORT.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir G. Sinclair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I read my words carefully—"perhaps accepting 30"—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend wish to correct me?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir G. Sinclair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I have done it once.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful. It might have been better if the age of 30 had been incorporated in the text of the Bill instead of being a general guide. It is the Minister's respon-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 152</span>
sibility to deal with that point.<br><br>
This morning's proceedings are still at an early stage, and the right hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) has not yet appeared. He should be here, since he is the cause of all this. If the debate on the Clause is prolonged, it will be due to his activity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend being quite fair to the right hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton)? It is not yet time for his appearance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall await his appearance with joy, because he is a fascinating and right hon. Member of this Committee. He descends like some rather loveable but irascible Jove from that Olympus which houses the Parliamentary Labour Party and lets loose his thunderbolts upon us. Last Wednesday, when he honoured us with his radiant presence, one felt that something was about to happen, because he was so unwontedly moderate in his approach to this subject. He spoke without anger, without overt signs of irritation at the presence in the Committee of hon. Members who might disagree with him. We should have known what was going to happen, and it did happen. The right hon. Gentleman sprang his Amendment upon the Committee, and most of its members, after sundry huddles and consultations, voted for it.<br><br>
At that point, the Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) congratulated his right hon. Friend, whom he described as "the right hon. Member", on having wrecked a Bill which would have been most useful to the community. According to the hon. Member for Pontypool, his right hon. Friend succeeded in forcing through a wrecking Amendment. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Despite a most helpful intervention by the Minister which would have caused me to withdraw my Amendment in the light of the promissory note, which he carefully spelled out, indicating that the Government felt—as the House and any responsible Government must feel—that there was need for some precautions, we now have a Clause which does away with the need for any reservations at all."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee C,</i> 16th February, 1972; <i>c.</i> 127.]</p></blockquote>
Then came the slightly barbed congratulation to the right hon. Member for Sowerby on having wrecked a Bill which could have been most useful to the community.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0089">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 153</span>
There is a difference between us. My hon. Friend the Member for Yarmouth and I do not agree that the Bill could be most useful to the community. If the right hon. Member for Sowerby's Amendment has wrecked the Bill, so be it. He has put the cat among the pigeons and has left the Committee with a pretty kettle of fish.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Barkston Ash (Mr. Alison), the Under-Secretary of State, has correctly predicted that, whatever happens, the effect of this Measure, if it is ever placed on the Statute Book, will be short, because of the reorganisation of the National Health Service. What the Family Planning Association will do then, poor dears, I do not know. The Minister having said that its life will be short—to some extent, this goes against my argument—it may be said, why should we worry if the Bill is inapt and will have no profound or prolonged effect upon the life of the community? However, with Clause 1 as amended, its life will be nasty and brutish, as well as short. I am surprised that the Under-Secretary of State did not advise the Committee to reject the Amendment, because he seems to have been working in close harmony—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must come back to the Clause as amended and not talk about an Amendment which has already been discussed and disposed of.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Amendment has completely transformed the Clause, Mr. Fitch, it is difficult to discuss the Clause without alluding to it, because the reasons for opposing the present Motion are that the Clause, repulsive as it was, is intolerable now that it has been amended. Am I wrong in pursuing that line of argument?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Gentleman very carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pavitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Fitch. I have carefully studied the previous two records of the Committee's proceedings. There has been considerable discussion over the Amendment and also on the Clause to date. As a certain number of points on the Amendment have already been made several times and there
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 154</span>
seems to be a limit to the number which can be made, could you rule on whether we have reached the stage when further reference constitutes tedious repetition and is, therefore, out of order?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Fitch. With great respect, is it not plain, now that the Clause has been altered out of recognition, that nothing unreasonable is being done by the Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be out of order to discuss the circumstances in which the Clause has been amended, but it is not out of order to discuss the amended Clause. The hon. Member for Chigwell (Mr. Biggs-Davison) has been discussing the circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see. We are looking forward to my sitting down, and even more to hearing from the Minister. I had intended to ask the Minister why he did not, in the interests of good legislation, advise the Committee not to accept the Amendment which, in the event, transformed Clause 1.<br><br>
The Minister was free with his advice. He advised the Committee to reject the Amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Bedwelty (Mr. Kinnock) but he would not commit himself on this particular Amendment. That was surprising, because I am sure that he would be the last person to wish to have forced on his right hon. Friend a greater responsibility or a duty to do, by circular, what would have been done by Clause 1 had not the wrecking Amendment of the right hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) been passed last Wednesday.<br><br>
Now we have a Bill which—despite the irreversibility of which the sponsor has spoken and despite the serious nature of this operation, subject to an unknown circular from a hypothetical Secretary of State—amounts to vasectomy from a very immature age till the grave.<br><br>
I remind hon. Members of what the hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead) said on Second Reading. He was insistent on having this age limit in the Bill and he attached considerable importance to it. I think I am right in saying that the hon. Gentleman did not vote for the Amendment moved by his right hon. Friend the Member for Sowerby. How does the hon. Gentleman now

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 155</span>
see the position? Hon. Members may feel that this kind of legislation is better undertaken by the Government and that the Bill should be withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was not my intention to intervene before the Under-Secretary had had an opportunity to reply, but to shorten the proceedings it might be best if questions were put now about the new shape of the Clause. I apologise—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pavitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Fitch, may I seek your guidance? I know that one can speak as many times as one wishes in Committee, but does the same rule apply to the debate on the Clause stand part?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Fitch.<br><br>
I share the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Chigwell (Mr. Biggs-Davison) my hon. Friend is the best Under-Secretary of State for a long time. I go further. He is the best Under-Secretary of State—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security (Mr. Michael Alison)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I anticipate my hon. Friend the Member for Chigwell (Mr. Biggs-Davison) by pointing out that he was referring to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and not to myself?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see—but the cap fits both equally well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure my hon. Friend and the Committee that for the purpose of my argument, "Secretary of State" embraces "Under-Secretary of State."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In order not to get at cross-purposes with the Committee, for the members of which I have the greatest respect and affection, I shall get on with my queries.<br><br>
May I try to clear up for the benefit of my own mind—which is not very clever in these matters—precisely what the Under-Secretary wants? He made what I thought was a highly significant intervention last week. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"There is no doubt that professional advisers to the local authorities will be able to draw upon the same corpus and body of expert knowledge …"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee C,</i> 16th February, 1972; <i>c.</i> 116.]</p></blockquote>
He made it clear that he felt that it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 156</span>
seemed as if the Ministry would not take that much detailed responsibility for any circular which it might issue at a later stage and which, indeed, he has promised. I want to know more about the terms of this circular.<br><br>
It is all very well for hon. Members just lightly to pass off what happened last week but as my hon. Friend said, it cannot be lightly passed over. It would be out of order for me to talk about that Amendment, but I can talk about the Clause. We now have a completely different Clause and it has completely changed the Bill. Some people are, not to put it too lightly, a little disturbed about the new form of the Clause.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
I am amazed that the Under-Secretary does not seem to be in the least disturbed by the change that has come over the Bill as a result of this change. It is all very well to talk about sending out circulars. As my hon. Friend the Member for Chigwell said, we are not basically worried about what may or may not be in a circular, though this is important as a last-ditch matter. We are worried about what is in the Clause and what sort of protection, if any, it gives.<br><br>
It seems to contain little or no protection. So little protection is there that the sponsor of the Bill voted against the Amendment which altered the Clause so drastically. The whole thing is a nonsense. The hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead) has been utterly reasonable and has tried to help us, but when it comes to—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Tom Stuttaford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend suggesting that any Government who ever accept an Amendment make nonsense of a Bill, and that it is pointless for any Committee ever to amend a Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and medical Friend, with his great experience of our procedures, will know the answer to that probably better than I do. To talk about the Amendment would put me out of order, and to that extent that is a slightly unfair interruption. It was a wrecking Amendment. Governments do not like wrecking Amendments and they use every possible means to put the position right so that such an Amendment does not, in fact, wreck.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Chig-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0091">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 157</span>
well reminds me that on Second Reading the sponsor of the Bill said:
<br><blockquote><p>"For the couple who present themselves, calmly and rationally, for vasectomy but with no medical indication that it is needed, the only additional check required would be a lower age limit for the man, which the Bill fixes at 30. By that time society can say it has protected for a long period a man's right to have a family, even though he wishes to abdicate that right. In the vast majority of vasectomies done outside cases of extreme medical need the man is already 30 or considerably more."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 21st January, 1972; Vol. 829, <i>c.</i> 837.]</p></blockquote>
That was eminently reasonable for someone who believes in the Bill. Let me say at once that I am not trying to wreck the Bill. With the greatest respect—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I interrupt again?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. My hon. and medical Friend must allow me to complete a sentence.<br><br>
I assure the hon. Member for Derby, North that I would love to see the Bill collapse. But if it does not collapse, then I want it to contain certain safeguards; and I am talking only about the safeguards praised on Second Reading. We are in the oddest situation. We have no indication at all—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is now merely repeating what he said at our last Sitting. Unless he has some new points to make, he should finish his speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall, of course, comply with your wishes on this matter, Mr. Fitch. It is, nevertheless, also true to say that we have not yet had an intervention from the sponsor of the Bill. I am sure that when that comes, it will be very helpful to us.<br><br>
We are in a serious situation. The entire character of the Bill has been altered. We have had a week in which to think about the new situation and though the Under-Secretary has tried to be helpful, he has in no way set my mind at rest about what may or may not happen under the terms of the Bill, with its changed first Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security (Mr. Michael Alison)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell) mentioned in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 158</span>
his opening remarks that he was a little disappointed that I had not expressed a greater sense of disturbance or disquiet at the tabling and then the passing of the Amendment. I confirm that when speaking to the Amendment of the right hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) last week, I deliberately took up a position of neutrality; I shall explain why shortly.<br><br>
I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Yarmouth, my hon. Friend the Member for Chigwell (Mr. Biggs-Davison) and the hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse), whose remarks I listened to carefully last week, that I have registered extremely sensitively the disquiet and sense of disturbance to which they have given expression. I shall do my best to allay some of these misgivings as I develop my comments.<br><br>
I will first justify to the Committee the position of neutrality which I thought it better to recommend when dealing with the right hon. Gentleman's Amendment last week. It is obvious that there may occur, with all too depressing regularity, social cases among young men which come to the knowledge of local authorities. This is an unavoidable reality of life.<br><br>
I received a letter from an hon. Member, in turn from a constituent, only the day before yesterday, describing the circumstances of a father aged 20, with four children. I ask the Committee to bear in mind that these situations of extreme social stress do occur; a young father, perhaps as young as 20, with a number of children, living in appalling housing conditions, quite unable to cope with the family responsibilities that have fallen almost accidentally upon him—children taken into care, the normal or traditional methods of contraception having failed with monotonous regularity. There may occur social cases of this kind to which local authorities need to address themselves. There is at least this possibility at the social level of which we must take cognizance.<br><br>
At the same time I recognise, as I recognised at the time of making my declaration of neutrality, that what the hon. Member for Pontypool vividly described as the possibility of the lowering of the age range introducing a "rams' charter", was a proper concern of the Committee. In confirming
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0092">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 159</span>
to myself that it was right to advocate neutrality, nevertheless, I sought to weigh up the likely extent to which, in fact, local authorities would have occasion to drop below the age limit which was originally written into the Bill.<br><br>
I took some consolation from the fact that the Simon Population Trust—which I think can be fairly regarded as an enthusiast in this sphere—in its sample of over 1,000, to which reference has been made, found that only 6.7 per cent. of those with whom it was concerned in its report were under 30. I believe that this is some guideline to the extent to which local authorities, which by no means necessarily share the crusading zeal of the Simon Population Trust, would be at least as prudent and anxious to reflect the views expressed in the House. These views are likely to be expressed by their own local supporters and professional advisers. That prudence is properly applicable to the question of how far below the original waterline we had written into the Bill of the age of 30, they should really go.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although the figures of the Simon Trust indicate the percentage which the Under-Secretary gave, the Marie Stopes Clinic's figures suggest that about 24 per cent. of those concerned are under 30. There are, of course, the extreme social indications about which the hon. Gentleman has been talking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are still left with the impression that a substantial minority will be below the age of 30. I shall weigh carefully the additional information. It is all grist to the mill to the considerations that my right hon. Friend will have to take into account in the advice which he gives to local authorities.</span></p>
<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leo Abse</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The percentage which has been quoted from the Marie Stopes Clinic is bound to cause increasing disquiet. Had there been an opportunity of making a broadcast with a doctor and observing her standards—as to when she would give a vasectomy to young people and to the unmarried—it would have been apparent that they are a long way from the type of standards which the Minister was indicating may have to be taken into account in genuine social cases. The need for continuing caution therefore remains.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 160</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point. I have listened most carefully, as will my right hon. Friend, to the real sense of disquiet which has been expressed about the new free age range which has emerged as the Bill is now amended. I remind the Committee of the scope of a circular to a local authority. I have before me the Circular dated 5th July, 1971, which was sent to county and county borough councils in England, the London borough councils and a a number of other councils, about the Family Planning Act. Its first paragraph is a substantial verbatim extract from a statement to Parliament made by the then Secretary of State in an earlier debate on family planning.<br><br>
I assure the Committee that there is no reason why, in a circular which we shall issue in due course to local authorities, substantial extracts of parliamentary opinion, as summarised and expressed by my right hon. Friend or by me, should not be reproduced as part of the circular.<br><br>
The scope which we envisage for local authorities has already been clearly enunciated by me, and I repeat it. The vasectomy operation in the hands of local authorities will generally be regarded as suitable only for older men who have completed their families. It may be desirable and possible to include guidance in the advice which we issue to local authorities, making a specific reference to lower age ranges.<br><br>
Having made it clear that we regard the operation as suitable generally only for older men who have completed their families, there is no reason why we should not say that local authorities should consider with special care applications for vasectomy from candidates who are younger than the general run of patients—having made it clear that we regard the general run as being those of more mature years who have completed their families. I am certain that the point can be adequately taken by local authorities.<br><br>
We believe, in conjunction with the hon. Member for Pontypool and his right hon. Friend the Member for Sowerby that to be too specific or too rigid in any matter relating to the Bill, having regard to the general powers we propose to give local authorities, would be likely to be counterproductive in the sense that there will occasionally be the feckless young man who is in a hopeless family position and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0093">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 161</span>
under extreme social stress. The powers of local authorities to help in such cases should not be circumscribed by specific restrictions in the Bill.<br><br>
I recognise fully, however, the disquiet expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Chigwell (Mr. Biggs-Davison) and I still believe that it is possible to cover this point in guidance to local authorities and to rely on their humanity, professional advice and responsiveness to their electorate to see that the general wishes of the Committee and the will of Parliament are humanely, happily and fully observed. I advise the Committee therefore that, in its present form, as amended, the Bill can do more good than harm.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's statement has not got us any further. Has the Ministry considered what will happen in any case outside its immediate responsibility if any sort of age limit—this is the muddle that we have got into—is recommended or even stressed? What will happen to those under the age limit? There will be an enormous racket in vasectomy; I am sure there is a small racket at the moment. If the Ministry sets a certain age, everybody under that age will be got at by those wanting to do the operation for a nice fee. I am amazed that the Ministry does not appear to have considered this point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend speaks of the possibility of a racket. There is, however, no age limit on medical cases under the National Health Service and there are wide opportunities to secure this operation at any age subject to the willingness of surgeons to perform it privately. I do not believe that this is a serious problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intervene briefly to welcome unreservedly what the Under-Secretary said. He spoke of a number of hard and deserving cases which would come to the notice of local authorities of men under 30. My interest in the problem was principally aroused by a case in my constituency of a young man of 24 who already had eight children and whose wife was in a serious condition because of her medical problems. At that point a vasectomy had been refused.<br><br>
When I spoke of medical indications on health grounds, I had taken into ac-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 162</span>
count that this would normally be held to include the conditions of a young family of the sort which the Minister described; where the wife has had three, four or five children in a short time and her health has naturally—as it almost always is, however healthy one is—been affected.<br><br>
The essential point has been made very clear by the three hon. Members who have spoken this morning, explaining that the point of the Vote last Wednesday was not whether or not there were to be safeguards but that it was concerned with the problem which the Committee has discussed for some weeks; whether the safeguards should be incorporated in Statute or in a Ministerial circular. I should have been unhappy if the majority of the Committee had explained the Vote last Wednesday as being a vote against safeguards—a vote of population fanatics, a vote of those who wished to sweep safeguards out of the Bill.<br><br>
But the hon. Member for Hampstead (Mr. Finsberg), the hon. Member for Dorking (Sir George Sinclair) and the hon. Member for Willesden, West (Mr. Pavitt) have in turn said, in most moderate language, that they are not against safeguards. They have not increased my concern; they have uttered sentiments with which I entirely agree. I believe that most of the points they covered can be raised in the circular.<br><br>
If the debate last week became a little acerbic at one point, it was because there is an echo in the Committee of old, unhappy, far-off things and battles long ago—or at least four or five years ago. I think the Committee has taken as its general consensus that a need for limitations exists and that that need can be met by the kind of circular which the Minister outlined very clearly at our last Sitting and to which I referred in a passage which hon. Gentlemen opposite never quote when they discuss my advocacy of the 30 age limit.<br><br>
I am sure the Committee accepts that the need for limitations to be written into a statute varies inversely with the willingness of the Minister to give the kind of assurances which he has clearly given this morning about the way in which the views of Parliament will be conveyed to local authorities. I welcome that. We have been pushing at an open door throughout our deliberations. In view of the Minister's

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These proposals would have the effect of not allowing Parliament to spend money on vasectomy in the National Health Service. This is a highly controversial question for the sponsors of the Bill. I realise that. I apologise to him, the hon. Member for Derby, North, but it is difficult to do it in any other way for one as unversed as I am in the ways of putting down Amendments. I do not think that my hon. Friend the Member for Chigwell (Mr. Biggs-Davison) will disagree when I say that our basic point is that we are totally against this sort of</span></p>

<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 9, Noes 2.</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 10, Noes 2.</p>
<p>matter having Government blessing.</p>
<p>Of course, as the Minister said earlier this morning, there may be the occasional difficult case. As my hon. Friend the Member for Chigwell reminded me, however, hard cases do not necessarily make good law. There are many facets of the Bill that make one wonder whether Governments are wise to involve the taxpayers' money in this sort of matter. If there is permission for local authorities, even with the blessing of Government that the matter should be their concern, on certain conditions and with certain restrictions, it may be argued that this is a good thing, but the longer we go on, the more horrified I am at the results of Governments sponsoring this sort of matter, because the taxpayers' money may be so ill spent.</p>
<p>I return to Clause 1, which I know I cannot discuss in any detail but which I have to use to show why I do not want the money advanced by the Government. I take, first the question of counselling services. I met someone recently in Norwich, a man of many parts and a Left-winger. I do not have permission to give his name, but I shall tell the promoter of the Bill his name

privately afterwards.</p>
<p>Without wishing to bore the Committee, I should like to relate his short history because it has some bearing on the matter and on whether Government should take part in these somewhat dangerous exercises. This is a man of 50, or a little more—he looks much younger. He told of how, when he and his wife had had three children, they decided—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pavitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Fitch. I am trying to relate what the hon. Gentleman is saying to this part of the Clause, which deals with money. I should be grateful for your guidance on whether he is in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have heard nothing out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Fitch. One is under constant badgering, and it is heartening, even to a Member who has been here for more than two or three years, to have such protection from the Chair when points of order are raised against him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman ought to be careful, or he will put himself out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I realise that it would be wrong to carry on complimenting the Chairman;, so I shall continue with my story of the man of 45 or 50 in Norwich who told me the story of his family. I am using this to illustrate how difficult these matters can be. They had three children, and the wife became pregnant again. They tried to persuade their doctors—he said "their doctors", so perhaps more than one was involved—to agree to an abortion. The doctors would not perform it, but eventually, by one means or another, they procured an abortion. The next four or five years were spent, according to him, in mental misery because of what had happened. They had another baby after four years; they had another baby after five or six years; and finally they had their sixth child. At any stage between the third and fourth child, they would have agreed—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Douglas Houghton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Fitch. I am puzzled about
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 166</span>
what the Committee is now being asked to do. Does this Amendment not amend the Money Resolution? A Money Resolution was passed by the House—
<br><blockquote><p>"That, for the purposes of any Act of the present Session to secure the provision, as part of the National Health Service, by local health authorities of voluntary vasectomy services on the same basis as the contraception services provided under the National Health Service (Family Planning) Act 1967, it is expedient to authorise"—</p></blockquote>
How can the Committee amend what the House has already authorised?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment is within the Money Resolution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Houghton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is that in order?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Fitch, for saving the extinction of my story, which has little more to tell. This man—who would be a friend of my hon. and medical Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford)—said that had vasectomy been available, and had they known about it, between the third child and the fourth, which they did not want, they would certainly have used it. He then said—and, with respect to my hon. Friend the Member for Barkston Ash (Mr. Alison), this is a case in the opposite sense from the case he raised earlier—he would have had the vasectomy operation, and then they would not have had—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is well away from the Amendment. Will he please return to it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Fitch. There has been a constant attack upon me when I have attempted to make my speeches, although I have tried very hard to keep in order. During my short story, I have been interrupted three times on points of order. It is not without foundation that I say I have been under constant attack. Were it not for the help of the Chair, I should be in serious trouble. I prefaced the short story that I was hoping to tell—which has been made long by interruptions on points of order—by saying that I only used it to show how dangerous it is for Government to use the taxpayers' money for this sort of matter. With the greatest respect, Mr. Fitch, I have listened to masterly speeches from members of the Committee, which,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0096">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 167</span>
because of their mastery, have bedazzled the Committee and put out of mind the possibility that they could have been out of order.<br><br>
In speaking to this Amendment and the new Clause, I have done everything I can to be as brief as possible. In order to be brief, I used a relevant illustration to show how dangerous it is for Governments to interfere in this sort of matter. I realise that we are in a difficult position. The Government's view on this, apparently, is to accept the responsibility. I am against that. I recognise that people who are prepared to pay for it can have a vasectomy, but this is a different situation; the Government are giving their blessing to State vasectomy. This is what all the argument is about.<br><br>
I have an argument on the legal side, as to whether it is lawful to perform this operation, which the Minister has completely ignored. Of course I am het up about it. I have the greatest affection for my hon. Friend the Member for Barkston Ash—if I knew him better, I should have an even greater affection for him—but affection will not be written into the Bill; nor will affection cure the Bill of the ills from which it now suffers. My Amendment and the new Clause attempt, in a humble way, to do just that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Houghton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell) has made clear that he is against vasectomy in all forms and in all circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Houghton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not as sweeping as that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. It is most kind of the right hon. Gentleman to give way. I have not condemned vasectomy for medical reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Houghton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to discern, from anything that the hon. Member said at any time, that he views the Bill with favour. The House gave the Bill a Second Reading without a Division. It is true that we have somewhat amended Clause 1 by removing an age qualification, but a full explanation has been given by the Under-Secretary this morning of the advice which will be given to local authorities. The Committee has passed Clause 1, as amended.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Yarmouth seeks
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 168</span>
to restrict the financial provision for the Bill. While contraceptive services under the National Health Service (Family Planning) Act, 1967, can be paid for by moneys voted by Parliament in general for local authority health services, the Amendment and the new Clause propose to draw a distinction between vasectomy and other forms of contraception. In other words, no moneys which were voted in general, as I understand it, could be spent in this direction. It would require a specific authorisation and a specific allocation of money for this purpose.<br><br>
Since this will be an extension of the 1967 Act, it is undesirable to distinguish in financial provision between the original provisions of the 1967 Act and the extension of that Act which this Bill proposes to make. In support of the Amendment and the new Clause, the hon. Gentleman referred to the taxpayer's money.<br><br>
It is always a good parliamentary ploy to refer to the taxpayer and his money, but the taxpayer has to pay for many things that he does not approve of. Many citizens disapprove of expenditure for defence, but they must contribute towards it. Some people disapprove of Catholic education, but they have to contribute towards it. I deeply object to Catholic education, but I have to contribute towards it. In a community, we must all join in paying for things which we may disapprove of. We cannot all choose what our taxation will be spent on. It is a question whether the community in general wants a particular service sufficiently to justify collective action in supporting it. This, surely, is what the Bill expresses.<br><br>
12 noon.<br><br>
The Bill, if the House eventually approves it, will express the desire of the community to extend the scope of the 1967 Act. In so doing, it wishes to make the same financial provision for the extension as for the original service. That seems perfectly logical, so the Committee should reject this move to distinguish between different forms of contraception under the Act.<br><br>
If the extended provision were so distinctive that it had to be provided for in a way entirely different from the original service under the 1967 Act, it could not have been done by an extension to that Act; it would have required a separate
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0097">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 169</span>
Bill. Nobody, for example, would dream of extending the 1967 Act to provide local authority services for abortion, because abortion is so separate that no one would wish to tag it on to the contraceptive services under the National Health Service (Family Planning) Act, 1967. If, therefore, this is not so distinctive or so subject to a separate kind of objection, deeper than that given originally to the Family Planning Act, the extension of the service should be financed in the same way as the original service. That seems a reasonable approach to the matter.<br><br>
If some of us who do not hold strong religious views were as intolerant towards those who do as they are towards us, it would be a less tolerant society. I am condemned as a Humanist. It is a form of condemnation. Nobody respects the views of a Humanist; they are condemned. But we should all respect religious conviction in others.<br><br>
The two hon. Gentlemen opposite, the Members for Chigwell (Mr. Biggs-Davison) and for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell) are Catholics and are speaking from a catholic point of view, which I understand. They may be offended by some of the things which the Protestant and secular Members of the House or of the community wish to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The right hon. Gentleman is going a little wide of the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Houghton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to identify the real grounds underlying this Amendment and the new Clause. We are up against not the logic or the common sense of the matter but something far deeper. I was merely identifying what that is. If it is out of order, I shall not pursue it. But there are some things I came to this Committee to say, I am happy to be able to say quite a few of them, and perhaps, before the Bill is finished, I shall have the opportunity of saying a few more.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be grateful to the right hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton), who always springs into action about noonday for the clarity and candour of his remarks upon the Amendment and the new Clause. I am glad that he spoke as he did, because it gives me opportunity at once to assure him that I do not condemn him for being a Humanist. I may disagree with his inter-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 170</span>
pretation of what is truly humanist, but I do not condemn him, or any hon. Member, for sincerely held views. I do not know why the right hon. Gentleman should become so excited because there are two members of the Committee who disagree with the Bill in principle and in detail. That shows intolerance. The attitude taken at an earlier stage by the right hon. Gentleman exhibited a certain intolerance on his part. But let us not go into that.<br><br>
I shall be brief, because I see that the hon. Member for Cornwall, North (Mr. Pardoe) has returned again, and, although he makes no contribution to our debate, he is effective in stopping other hon. Members from making their points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pardoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Any fool can take part in a discussion of this sort. It takes a strong man to keep silent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is interesting. I thought that Parliament was a place where people talk and discuss, not one where measures are simply railroaded through, as the hon. Member for Cornwall, North implies. It is an extraordinary statement to be made by a member of the Liberal Party. Anyway, those of us who are in the minority on this Committee are grateful for the protection and tolerance which you show us, Mr. Fitch.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Sowerby was correct in divining antipathy to the Bill. I freely admit that I am opposed to the Bill in principle. He was correct also in saying that the purpose of the new Clause and the Amendment is to restrict the financial provision for the Bill. That is our legitimate intention. I detect a certain impatience with parliamentary process in the Committee. The right hon. Gentleman said that it is a parliamentary ploy to refer to the taxpayer's interests. But that, again, is the purpose of Parliament, to protect the interests of the taxpayer. That is why the House of Commons became the dominant element in our legislature. I am surprised that so old and respected a parliamentarian should speak with such contumely of a "parliamentary ploy" in connection with the interests of the taxpayer.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman correctly said that many of us have to pay for things with which we disagree. We all have to, Humanists and Roman Catholics. That is one of the reasons why we have tabled the Amendment and the new Clause, to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0098">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 171</span>
restrict the financial provision for the Bill. Because many citizens have to foot the bill for purposes with which they disagree, we wish to limit it. New Clause No. 2 would provide:
<br><blockquote><p>"No expenses incurred by local health authorities in implementing the provisions of this Act shall rank for grants to be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament …"</p></blockquote>
The purpose is to bring responsibility for paying for this service down from the central government to the local health authorities, which are, or should be, in closer touch day to day with the ordinary people of the country, not all of whom belong to the anti-life brigade. It is quite reasonable that the citizen, as ratepayer through his local health authority, should be able to decide whether this service should be paid for. If it is a new development in contraceptive services, that does not mean that it is a wrong development.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's remarks frighten me. In what sense are supporters of vasectomy the anti-life brigade? Is he now trying to advance a new doctrine, that life begins before conception.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I have offended the hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead). The Bill is intended as a means of birth limitation, is it not? It is limitation of procreation. I should have thought so. I acquit the hon. Gentleman of any lack of sincerity or public-spirit. He is actuated by the highest motives. But this kind of measure arises from a certain philosophy which I do not share. But if, by using the expression "anti-life brigade", I have given offence to the hon. Gentleman or anyone else, I at once withdraw it.<br><br>
The danger of interruptions is that I may lose the trend of my argument, and then it may take rather longer to find it again. The point that I was trying to make was this. The right hon. Member for Sowerby, who has great knowledge of these matters, said that if we were to pass the Amendment and the new Clause a distinction would be imported between the other contraceptive services and the service to be provided under the Bill. If that be so, it does not follow that our idea is wrong. It will always be possible for the law to be amended to provide that the other contraceptive services should be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 172</span>
brought into line with the contraceptive service provided for in the Bill, should it reach the Statute Book amended and with the new Clause added.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pavitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I oppose the Amendment. I am glad that we have two qualified doctors on the Committee, because I felt at times that the hon. Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell) was suffering from chronic verbal diarrhoea and it might be necessary to give him some assistance. He based his main case for the Amendment on the need to protect the taxpayers' money. Indeed, the Bill is important from the point of view of the taxpayers' money. The part of Clause 2 which we are discussing is essential to the Bill. In terms of economy, the passing of the Clause will be a great advantage.<br><br>
Anyone who knows anything about it knows that it will probably save the National Health Service and other welfare services millions of pounds—not hundreds of thousands, but millions. Anyone who knows anything about obstetric and gynaecological provision in the hospitals, or about the provision of antenatal and midwifery services in the locality, will know that the amount to be provided here will be infinitely small compared with the amount otherwise spent over the whole field of National Health Service provision elsewhere, apart from the fact that the money we shall be expending will make a great contribution in easing other social problems that occur in the community because of the acute anxiety neuroses which can stem from anxieties arising in human relationships.<br><br>
I find it difficult to understand that people who have strong convictions about humanity and relationships between person and person, especially those who have a high understanding of the importance of the family and family life, should make the kind of contributions that we have just heard.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will proceed quickly. I am not quite so strong as the hon. Member for Cornwall, North (Mr. Pardoe). I have weakened and given a three minutes' exposition of why I feel that we should accept the Clause as drafted and speedily proceed to a vote.</span></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pardoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not that I have been stung into speech but merely that I want to contribute a few words on the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0099">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 173</span>
basic question on this Amendment, namely, the money question. I am not entirely sure whether the argument is about the principle of public expenditure for an immoral purpose—that was suggested in one or two of the speeches—or about the cost to the taxpayer.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) has dealt in general terms with the question of the cost to the taxpayer. I should like to do so in a slightly different way and suggest that there will be no cost to the taxpayer at all. There will be a massive net gain to the taxpayer if we pass the Bill and if we spend the small amounts of public money involved in implementing it. Let us take the present waiting list for vasectomy as being some 10,000. If all those 10,000 are done in the first year, assuming that they will cost, in round figures, £20 a time, the total cost is obviously £200,000.<br><br>
But one has to look at the other side of the ledger, too. There are massive savings, whatever assumptions one makes. Over some time now, I have been investigating what would be the net saving to the taxpayer of a really effective free family planning system. There will be savings in prenatal care, payments to the G.P., the cost of the clinics, free dental treatment for expectant mothers, maternity grants for home confinements, maternity grants for hospital confinements, the cost of domiciliary midwives, antenatal care, the cost of district nurses, health visitors, hospital treatment for post-natal illness, the cost of reduced-price milk and welfare foods, family allowances, tax allowances, supplementary benefit payments, children taken into care in local authority homes, children fostered, and children in primary schools.<br><br>
It is impossible to calculate exactly what the net saving would be to the taxpayer, but if I take just three considerable—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Fitch. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Member, who is making a most interesting contribution, but I fear that, perhaps, he is reading out his facts and figures at such a pace that the Official Reporter, admirable and efficient though he is, is having a little difficulty in keeping up with him—quite apart from slower-witted members of the Committee.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 174</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pardoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was trying not to take up more of the time of the Committee than was absolutely necessary. May I slow down for the sake of the calculations to come, merely taking three items which are fairly easily quantifiable and which I have, in fact, already quantified. First, family allowances. Taking the figure of 10,000 on the waiting list, and assuming that each vasectomy means one less child, though in fact each vasectomy will mean rather more than that, that is 10,000 fewer children. Let us assume that those children are not the first children, that being the likely event—most vasectomies will be after a certain number of children have already arrived—that works out roughly at £10,000 per week, or £500,000 a year.<br><br>
Next, the savings in tax allowances. The tax allowance for a child under 11 works out to the parent at about £50, so that would save £500,000 a year. The cost of a primary school place is about £100. It was £102 last year. So that is £1 million. There is a cool £2 million on three items alone saved for a cost of £200,000, and, as a taxpayer, I rate that a very good bargain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not for a moment want to speak before the Minister—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman rose and I called him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I will continue. The hon. Member for Cornwall, North (Mr. Pardoe) has made a most interesting contribution, not only interesting but highly exciting for the future of the nation. His computation was that by saving 10,000 births a year we would save £2 million. It would be out of order to go into this in great detail, but it is an exciting prospect. Instead of the sort of Amendments which my hon. Friends and I have moved, we ought to move Amendments to have compulsory vasectomy. Then we might save 100,000 births a year. Then we would be getting somewhere. We could pay off the National Debt. If one went far enough, one would not have any expenditure at all on children or on the National Health Service.<br><br>
What a monstrous proposition, that one counts the cost of a child in terms of the money that would be saved by the nation if the child was not there. Ask
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0100">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 175</span>
any mother about it. What a monstrous proposition we have managed to get at last from this distinguished Committee. The hon. Member for Cornwall, North has been called "the strong silent man" by my hon. Friend. I have always gazed at him with admiration, and his contributions have been of a high order. This morning, perhaps, the success of his moving of the Closure went to his head. I am sure that he meant it as a joke, I shall not criticise him for saying it.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) is not with us at the moment. I shall not compliment him this morning, if he will forgive me, because he made such a reasonable and helpful contribution. I am delighted to see that the right hon. Gentleman has now re-joined the Committee. I promise him that, if he wishes to interrupt me, he need not try to find some point of order on which to do it, as I shall give way to him immediately.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman claimed—it is not without reason that I mention this—that both my hon. Friend and I, who happen to be Catholics and not unproud of it—it would be difficult to make a party political point out of this—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman will recall that I ruled the right hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) out of order on his references to that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed, Mr. Fitch. I apologise. I had forgotten that event. I was so overwhelmed by his speech. There was on thing in it, Mr. Fitch, to which, I am sure, you will not disallow reference. The right hon. Member accused two members of the Committee of not being motivated by common sense but—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must come back to the Amendment, which is fairly narrow on the question of financial provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is, Mr. Fitch. But may I plead with you to be allowed to answer this specific point? On several occasions, the right hon. Member for Sowerby, whom I do not wish to go on about or compliment on his performances, felt himself unable to give way to hon. Members, and when he attacked me this morning I did not try to interrupt him because I wanted to save the time of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 176</span>
Committee and because I thought it extremely unlikely that he would give way if I tried to. But I think it not unreasonable to defend myself against the accusation that we are not using common sense. Common sense is used just as much by me as it has been by the right hon. Member for Sowerby. I shall not keep the Committee, except to reiterate—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pavitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Really?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes—except to stress again that it is the fallacy lying behind the whole Bill that has led my hon. Friend and me to seek ways of cutting down the damage that may be caused to society if the Government adopt it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The effect of the Amendment and the new Clause is to prevent expenditure under the Bill by local authorities being reckoned in the calculation for rate support grant. I must ask the Committee to reject the Amendment and the new Clause. I say that against the background of the clear indication given in the House, to which the right hon. Member for Sowerby referred, that the Bill should have a Second Reading. In doing that, the House effectively accepted the principle that vasectomy should be among the agreed local authority methods of sponsoring or providing family planning services. It agreed, in the words of the Bill's Long Title, that the vasectomy operation should be put
<br><blockquote><p>"on the same basis as the contraception services provided under the National Health Service (Family Planning) Act 1967"</p></blockquote>
—a point to which the right hon. Gentleman drew the Committee's attention in his intervention earlier.<br><br>
Local authority expenditure on personal health services is taken into account by the Government when calculating rate support grant. If it is right, as it clearly is, that family planning services should be supported in this way—that is to say, subject to rate support grant like other local authority services—it must in logic follow that the vasectomy operation should be treated <i>pari passu</i> on exactly the same basis.<br><br>
I appreciate the misgivings of my two right hon Friends—[<i>Laughter.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Things to come.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: —I beg your pardon, Mr. Fitch—I should say my two hon Friends, or, perhaps, very hon. Friends—about
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0101">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 177</span>
the broad principle of the Bill, but the fact remains that the House has decided to accept the principle, and it was for that reason that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury felt it right to—if I may use an appropriate phrase—fertilise the Bill with a Financial Resolution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In all the decisions which my hon. Friend and the Government have come to on this highly important matter—let us not run away from the importance of the Bill; it is enormously important—what kind of conversations have he and his Ministry had with the various bodies interested in the introduction of this highly controversal matter?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That does not really arise on the Amendment, but I assure my hon. Friend that not only have we garnered a great deal of relevant information in deciding in my Department what advice we should give to the House, but further consultations will, naturally, take place if the House finally decides to give the Bill a Third Reading.<br><br>
We must keep in perspective what is involved in the public moneys which might be involved here. It is extremely unlikely that local authorities will in practice spend measurable sums on providing the operation in the short period before they cede their health powers to the central Government in 1974. At the present time, local authorities are engaged in trebling their expenditure on family planning services. I know that a number of hon. and right hon. Members here will be glad. But, even with the trebling in view, the total expenditure in the financial year 1972-73 is unlikely to exceed £2½ million. This figure covers all the traditional methods of family planning. It is extremely unlikely that local authorities, within the relatively small resources available to them, will suggest that over-riding priority should be given to the provision of vasectomy as against the traditional but more popular methods, which will make large claims on the £2½ million, especially as we shall guide them upon the discriminations they ought to make in the case of vasectomies.<br><br>
Very small sums are involved. If the Committee decides to allow the Clause to stand, there will be only one financial year, 1973-74, in which specific account will be taken of the vasectomy operation
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 178</span>
in the rate support grant negotiations. We are thinking of one financial year in which a budget of £2½ million to £3 million will have to accommodate not only vasectomy, as we shall advise local authorities to sponsor the operation, but also the whole range of other well known, well tried and broadly acceptable family planning methods.<br><br>
I make that point to put into perspective the practical effects which will arise in financial terms, the House having decided in principle that the operation is acceptable withn the armoury of local authority powers under family planning headings. I reiterate that we were compelled by the logic of the House's decision to fertilise the Bill with a Financial Resolution. It would be both illogical and barely practicable in terms of financial savings to the Exchequer to deny the Clause. I must, therefore, ask the Committee, with some regret because I do not like going against my hon. Friends, to reject the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I say a word to endorse what the Minister said. The Bill is an amending Measure. In the parent Act, which was debated and went through its Committee stage in only one week a few years ago, Clause 31 was neither amended nor discussed by the Committee. It was endorsed unanimously. The only conceivable objection which might be made now, apart from the root-and-branch objections which the two hon. Gentlemen have suggested, could be that, since the sums are so insignificant, there is no reason for them to come outside the area of self-financed local health authority expenditures. As the hon. Gentleman the Member for Barkston Ash said, that would be logically wrong.<br><br>
We fall back, therefore, as has been the case throughout the Committee, on deeper theological objections, objections of principle to the Clause and to the whole Bill. I can only say to the two hon. Gentlemen, since the question of their own views has come up this morning, that after extensive discussions on the matter and on the question of it coming within the financial provisions of the National Health Service, I met a great number of their co-religionists. In my constituency, last Saturday, after discussions with the Knights of St. Columba in Derby, I was told by a number of men that they warmly supported the Bill and they wished to see
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0102">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 179</span>
this facility within the provision of the National Health Service.<br><br>
It would be wrong in logic and in practice to deny the Clause, as the Minister has said. I hope that the Committee will reject both the Amendment and the new Clause No. 2.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pardoe</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose in his place and claimed to move,</i> That the Question be now put.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept such a Motion at this point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you very much for what you have just said, Mr. Fitch. It would be a bit much for the hon. Member for Cornwall, North (Mr. Pardoe), having made a speech himself, then to prevent other hon. Members from taking their proper part in the debate. I should have thought that that was conduct amounting to arrogance.<br><br>
I want to be brief. I wish that the hon. Gentleman the Member for Derby, North had not distracted me with his moving story of his meeting with the Knights of St. Columba. I do not agree with them in this respect, or with the hon. Gentleman. Each of us in the Committee—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will, I think, acknowledge that the Roman Catholic Church is deeply divided on the issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. There is no division in the authoritative teaching of the Catholic Church. But I should be wrong to be drawn into theological discussion. I insist that each member of the Committee put his own point of view as an individual Member responsible to his constituents, not calling in aid the views of other bodies, whether they be correctly represented or not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Though dissensions in the Catholic Church may be interesting, they are out of order. Will the hon. Gentleman come back to the Amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what I said, Mr. Fitch. I ventured to say that theological discussion would not be in order. The promoter of the Bill quoted the opinion of individual Roman Catholics in his support. Whether that is in order is not for me to say.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 180</span>
State has shown his usual distinction and courtesy, though I am a little sad because he seems to be departing a little from his normal neutrality, but he may be suffering from strain. He said that he wanted to fertilise the Bill. I would not mind sterilising the Bill. I think that a bit more neutrality might be needed.<br><br>
The argument advanced by the hon. Member for Cornwall, North was fallacious. I am not sure that it was seriously meant. Perhaps it was. Was it seriously meant?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pardoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The argument was seriously meant. It was backed by a great deal of research.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Member. I am glad that his contribution was serious. I am sure that his figures were perfectly correct. But it was an extraordinary argument. If one decreases the number of human beings in a community, one decreases the amount of wealth produced in the community. Therefore, to suggest that by a vigorous programme of vasectomy we shall improve the wealth and prosperity is the most ludicrous non-economics that one could hear even from a Liberal Member of Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pavitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman address himself to the problem that has now arisen? With the million unemployed, one is able to produce more goods by fewer people. The history of automation and electronics shows that the population, the number of heads, bears no relation to what can be produced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We could be drawn into all sorts of interesting arguments. We could discuss immigration policy if we were allowed to trespass so far from—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I appeal to the hon. Gentleman to come back to the Amendment, which is very narrow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, Mr. Fitch, I am constantly diverted by hon. Gentlemen opposite. I try to restrain myself, I try not to be tempted. I sometimes succeed in resisting temptation. Now, I shall not trespass any further on the Committee's time. I hope that, on reflection, the Committee will accept the Amendment and the new Clause.</span></p>

<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 10, Noes 2.</p>
<p>It will not have been missed by the Committee, and, in particular, by the promoter of the Bill, that my hon. Friend the Member for Chigwell (Mr. Biggs-Davison) and I, after consultation, decided to help as far as we could by not delaying the proceedings on Clauses 2 or 3. I do not ask for plaudits or the undying gratitude of the Committee. I mention it as a fact, in passing.</p>
<p>New Clause No. 1 reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"This Act shall expire on 31st December
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0104">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 183</span>
1973 unless renewed by an affirmative resolution of each House of Parliament."</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pavitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman help the Committee by telling us his intentions? Does he propose that we meet again next week, or does he hope to conclude today on the Clause which he is now moving?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am getting unwonted glamour in this debate when so intrepid a Member as the hon. Member for Willesden, West (Mr. Pavitt) leaves in my hands whether the Committee should meet next Wednesday. I have had no notification yet of a meeting of the Committee next Wednesday. He should ask the authorities of the House. If he thinks that the help of my hon. Friend and I to the Committee this morning, and the abstinence of the hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse), should be ignored, that is another matter; but I do not propose when the Committee should sit again.<br><br>
I am in some difficulty now. I realise that the Government are represented by only one Minister, but it is difficult to ask the Minister questions when he has, unfortunately, to absent himself from the Committee. I shall try to reserve my questions to him till last, although that puts me in a slight difficulty. Perhaps my hon. Friend will be able to do it, if I cannot.<br><br>
Basically, the reason for the new Clause is wrapped up in Government policy towards the National Health Service. I understand that the National Health Service reorganisation will take place early in 1974, but I suppose that it will start in 1973. I now spy my hon. Friend the Minister on the horizon. I can, therefore, get on more quickly, and I am grateful to him for coming in at so opportune a moment.<br><br>
The new Clause will help the Minister in the reorganisation of the National Health Service. I gather that I was right in assuming that the Service would be reorganised from the beginning of 1974, but that a lot of work would be taking place on the reorganisation during 1973. So we have put down the new Clause to provide that the Bill should expire on the 31st December, 1973. That should help the Minister to consider what will happen to such a Bill—which some people consider miserable and with which others are happy—by the time he reorganises the National Health Service.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 184</span>
I am concerned to get help from the Minister. Though he has been unable to help us in any degree, it has been very kind of him to be so attentive to my hon. Friend and to myself in our minority position. He has only said that we should be right hon. Gentlemen, but, to say that one should be right hon. and then say that one shall have one's head cut off anyway is not very helpful. I should like some small help on this new Clause. I should be grateful if the Minister could signify that it is accepted as an assistance to him.<br><br>
The Bill, if it ever becomes an Act towards the end of this year, will be one of the most short-lived Acts that have ever been put on the Statute Book. But it will be none the less important. In the meantime, I want people to think actively about their real position in relation to such an Act. I want the Government to have more consideration for the view of millions of people, who, I suspect, have not even begun to think about it, before giving it their final blessing by taking it within the scope of the revised National Health Service which comes into force early in 1974.<br><br>
The Minister, having shown such good will, would earn the gratitude of those to whom he has been so kind if he gave us this one point. The promoter of the Bill, who has been so helpful and kind, though not promising to replace anything that had wrecked the Bill so far, should accept such a reasonable and practical new Clause at this stage, rather than have to bring it up later, after the Minister has reconsidered his position between now and Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be flippant of me to say that I think that the result of the Amendment moved by the right hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) is that the Bill has become nastier and ought to be made shorter. Such flippancy on what my hon. Friend the Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell) has correctly described as a very important Bill would be deprecated.<br><br>
This new Clause is somewhat technical, and I suspect that my hon. Friend the Minister will wish to speak on it. I am sorry if he had other duties to which he wished to go and had to return. We are most grateful to him for his attention and for the unfailing courtesy and consideration which he has shown us.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0105">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 185</span>
This is such an important Measure, a new development in our legislation, that I think it entirely proper to insist on as much parliamentary control as possible on the implementation of it, if it ever becomes an Act.<br><br>
I stress the point because we have had this morning some rather cavalier observations about Parliament and parliamentary processes. The hon. Member for Cornwall, North (Mr. Pardoe) is an example. I am glad that we shamed him out of his strong silence into strong speech and converted him back to parliamentary ways. I was disturbed by what he and the right hon. Member for Sowerby said about impatience with our parliamentary processes.<br><br>
It is entirely right that my hon. Friend the Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell) should try, by means of the new Clause and in other ways, to insist on parliamentary control on the working of the Bill. Parliamentary control will be exerted by the provision that the Measure shall expire unless renewed by affirmative Resolution of each House. It would be up to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, having the experience of the working of the Bill, knowing its flaws in operation and the movement of public
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 186</span>
opinion, to decide whether a Resolution should be tabled and whether Parliament should be invited to continue the operation of the Bill. This seems entirely reasonable and proper.<br><br>
I hope that after hearing the Under-Secretary and the hon. Member for Derby, North we shall be in a frame of mind to adopt a proposal put forward by a minority in the Committee. That would be conducive to harmony and good feeling. It would also be fully in keeping with the charming temperament of the hon. Member for Derby, North. I hope that we can at least have this little piece of success to crown our endeavours.<br><br>
We emphasise the desirability of parliamentary control when we embark on something of great importance that is new to the Statute Book and to society. I take great pleasure in commending the new Clause to the Committee. I hope that we shall hear a sort of duet from the Under-Secretary and the hon. Member for Derby, North, approving the new Clause and the purpose behind it. Such a gesture—</span></p>
