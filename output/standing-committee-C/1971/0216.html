	<p>	<i>Amendment again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this Amendment we are taking the following:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>Amendment No. 3, in page 1, line 16, leave out "thirty years, or otherwise on medical grounds" and insert" sixty years ".</p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By the luck of the draw, I am starting off the morning. I hope the Committee will not have to bear with me as long as they did last week, but as you know, Mr. Fitch, I was subject to one or two interjections during the course of my remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been said, we are discussing the four Amendments together. Amendment No. 3, which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Chigwell (Mr. Biggs-Davison) and myself, is not a wrecking Amendment. That is why we have not put in "ninety-five years". I am not being repetitious; I am merely refreshing the memories of the Committee, as hon. Members may wish to have a moment to collect their thoughts, before launching into arguments on these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
This Bill would be more appropriate in a country like India or China or some continent heavily populated with too many people. The factors in this country are entirely different. The population increase is slowing down, not rushing up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Tom Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear the query raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford), because it may be that my hon. Friend and I, and the hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse), have a reluctant convert. This would be delightful and might enable the Committee eventually to see the light that it has not shown signs of seeing so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that the numbers of children per family, for instance, have risen and fallen. Unfortunately one only has the population report for the years up to 1948.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman agrees that it goes up and down, but the population studies for 1948 bear little relevance to the 1970s and 1980s. Perhaps he will also agree that it is not just a question of how many children are born, but the marriage age and how many children survive. This part of the hon. Gentleman's argument bears little relevance either to the Bill or to the facts of life today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is as always full of specifics, even at this early hour of the Committee, and of course is able to shoot holes in my argument. My argument is based on what I believe are the latest statistics available. I am not fortunate enough to have the report of the commission on population of the last census. So far as I am aware, it is not available. If somebody could assure me that it is available, I should be delighted, because we could then arm ourselves with up-to-date statistics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At any rate, there had been this reversal in the trend, and the population commission thought it was brought about by the advent of the one and two children family from the five children family that had been—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to continue to interrupt. We had a Select Committee inquiring into population last year. I cannot help feeling that it would be more relevant if we had those figures than the figures for 30 years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0060">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, my hon. Friend is again using his enormous powers of deduction and his dead logic in saying that it would be better if we had the figures which were prepared last year, than if we had to rely on the figures which were prepared in 1948. His logic is all the more astounding because he says that there was this statistical adventure last year. The only difficulty is that if my hon. Friend goes, as I have, to the Vote Office to ask for the latest official publication on population statistics, he will be handed this tome which refers to 1948 as the latest year for which figures are available. My hon. Friend has been very helpful to me so far. It is not easy to start at this time in the morning on this subject, but I wonder whether my hon. Friend could bring from his briefcase the latest set of population statistics. If he can, I should be much more up to date. If I am not careful, Mr. Fitch, I shall be incurring your displeasure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, that is so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can think of nothing which I want to do less at this time in the proceedings, or at any other time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very glad that my hon. Friend is leaving this point and is addressing himself to the Amendment. This is a very sterile argument. Was it not the case that all the predictions before the war were of depopulation, and since the war all the predictions have been of over-population? Perhaps we should regard all these figures of trends with considerable caution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, one does not have to go back to Lord Boyd-Orr to see the fallacy of the greatest people telling the world how they should run their lives and what will happen to them in the next few years if they do not do what they are told. All the experts with their prognoses of disaster are wrong, and they nearly always come unstuck. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his interjection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One may ask why we have chosen a figure of 60 rather than 30. I look upon this operation as mutilation. It is aimed at stopping birth—not as in abortion where it is child murder—and on all sorts of grounds I cannot bring myself to agree with it. It is logical, from my point of view, therefore, to try to raise the age at
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
which this operation may be performed, with the help of the benevolent grandmother, the State, from 30 to a higher age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One may ask why we, in our infinite wisdom, without the assistance of my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford), chose the age of 60. It may be asked, "Why not 70, 80 or 90?" I should have preferred 70 or 80 or 90, but I received no blessing from anybody for such an age, and I was cognisant of the fact that the hon. Member responsible for the Bill might consider that a wrecking Amendment, and it might have been considered so by the authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the choice of the age of 60, it was not an enormous discovery of logic; it was not reached as a result of deep and exhaustive thought; it was not reached as a result of consulting Old Moore's Almanack or important works on age statistics; it was merely a guess. The age of 60 seemed more sensible than 95, so we chose that age. I should be delighted to accept a different figure if the hon. Member responsible for the Bill were prepared to accept a figure of something over 50. I should be very pleased to do this. If the hon. Gentleman does not feel so inclined—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do, actually. I should like to ask whether my hon. Friend the Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell) is not entirely concentrating on the man. Marriage affects two people, even in darkest Norfolk. This entirely disregards the rest of the family, including the wife.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot help rising to this bait, and I shall be careful to keep in order. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South hands this to me on a plate. I must not advise. This would be rude in the extreme and bordering on enormous pomposity, and I like to avoid being pompous. The hon. Gentleman echoes an argument used by the other side last week. I shall not refer to the hon. Gentleman's remarks about Norfolk which were made in a sense of jollity of fun; they could not be serious, since it would be a rudeness to his own constituency, and he could not do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for bringing wives into this discussion, it is true that we discussed this last week and the week before. We argued about the wives on the question of marriage counselling. On this Amend-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0061">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
ment I cannot go back to a discussion on marriage counselling. The short answer is that we are not talking about the wives having a vasectomy at 30 or 60; we are talking about a vasectomy for the men at 60 rather than at 30. My hon. Friend will realise at once, since he is a medical practitioner and a man of vast experience—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we were talking about vasectomy we might be much happier. [	<i>Interruption</i>]. If my hon. Friend is to take over the Chair, it would be easier if he were to sit on the platform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Was not my hon. Friend talking about the size of families and family planning? He was not talking about the technicalities of vasectomy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When my hon. Friend has been in this place a few years—though I must not debate this point since it would be out of order as my hon. Friend's interjection appeared—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is on the brink of incurring my displeasure. Would he please return to the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This brink is a place that I have been trying to avoid for some time. I am sorry that you, Mr. Fitch, have had to bring me to order. I am most grateful to you for saving me from the fate of slipping over the brink.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With your permission, Mr. Fitch, and begging the indulgence of the Committee, I must be allowed to say to my hon. Friend that he will learn that it is difficult to interject in a manner so far removed from the Amendment that it does not really meet with much success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to take up the Committee's time, but I hope that the hon. Member who is responsible for the Bill will find himself able to accept this Amendment raising the age from 30 to 60, or some Amendment that will meet the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leo Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise primarily to speak to the Amendment in my name, but, in view of the grouping of the Amendments, I shall have to refer to the other Amendments in that group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This sterilisation Bill, dependent on how we shape it, can either be a genuine contribution to family stability or a ram's charter. It can be a Bill of great advantage contributing to the happiness
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
of the mature married couple with a completed family, or it can be an invitation to a reckless and indolent young bachelor lacking the maturity that parenthood so often brings to shirk for ever the responsibility of parenthood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment in my name, and no doubt the Amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock), are attempts to lay down at least guidelines to make it more likely that sterilisation will be a boon and not a curse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) who, unfortunately, is not here this morning but who spoke to his Amendment last week, injudiciously—in my view—declared, not for the first time, that he is violently opposed to the idea that the right of procreation is one of the basic human rights, and he added that is something that everybody must be able to do for himself without let or hindrance. If one does not believe that the right to parenthood is a basic human right, as I believe it to be, it is quite logical for my right hon. Friend to regard with favour any Bill which, however deviously or unintentionally, would ensnare a bachelor to give up irrevocably that right. Therefore, the right hon. Gentleman resists any enactment which says—as I wish it to say—that the State refuses to subsidise those unmarried men who in folly and youth set themselves aside from their peers and opt to live their lives out in permanent sterility, but not, of course, in celibacy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot, as the law stands, prevent a minority of surgeons, who may be ready to use their craft deftly for money from whoever submits himself, from wielding their scalpels in the private sector. I do not believe that Parliament would believe that taxpayers or ratepayers should subsidise young bachelors in their follies. The Bill as it stands gives the right to bachelors over the age of 30 as well as to married men to claim the opportunity within a subsidised clinic for a vasectomy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although women can anticipate parenthood, as those of us who have seen our little daughters play with their dolls are aware, I doubt whether many men are able to relish parenthood until they have experienced the reality of their newborn child. By providing through an Act of Parliament the right of access of young bachelors to a State local authority sterilisation service, we would be giving overt approval to immature narcissistic
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0062">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
attitudes that I do not believe the House would wish us to foster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have served too long, as many of us have here, on a local authority to make an apotheosis of them as the right hon. Member did when he spoke to his Amendment last week. I believe that although the overwhelming majority of councils, and undoubtedly of medical officers of health, may lay down that bachelors would not be publicly financed into sterility, a strong chairman or social work department or health committee of a local authority sharing the curious views of the right hon. Member, or a local authority with a medical officer of health identified with the population control fanatics, with which the hon. Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford) is associated, may frustrate the collective view of the House and perhaps of this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we must be assured that sterilisation on taxpayers' and ratepayers' money should not be indiscriminately given to any adult male irrespective of age or status. The hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead), the sponsor of the Bill, has suggested within the Bill that there should be an age limit. The right hon. Member has tabled an Amendment which would remove that age limit completely. I do not believe it is acceptable that sterilisation should be given indiscriminately to any adult male if he is a bachelor, however young he may be. An assurance must surely be obtained, either by statute or by unequivocal direction by the Minister, who could by the terms of the parent Act, the National Health Service (Family Planning) Act, withhold approval if the local scheme does not conform to the standards which he regards as necessary. It would be a symptom of a sick anti-life society, frightened of its own future, if it proffered financial aid to assist in the sterilisation of young men in their teens; that is what it would mean if the Amendment of the right hon. Member was accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The operation of a vasectomy is undoubtedly simple and safe. The decision to have a vasectomy, however, is literally one of life and death, and to take such a decision before families have been founded or marriages have been tested would be to give dangerous hostages to fortune. None of us, whether we are young or middle-aged, knows until death comes our full destiny. For most of us the general direc-
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
tion of our lives is at least dimly seen in our thirties. Surely to give, as the right hon. Member is suggesting, and apparently with the support of another hon. Member—since his name is on the Amendment—an 18-year-old whose life-style is still inchoate—today's legal adult—the right to claim a vasectomy on the rates, would be, under the mask of benevolence or a pretence of respect for young people, an act of vengeance by old men jealous of the potency and virility of youth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge that there are young men with large families who may rationally be regarded by society as deserving, if such is their considered wish, of obtaining a subsidised vasectomy. There are bound to be men of 28 or 29 with four or five children, and where the circumstances may well merit, if they wish it, a sterilisation to take place. The small exceptions, can only be dealt with by Ministry circular. Only in this way can the general principle of 30, which the hon. Member has put forward and which I support, be attained, while allowing for these exceptional cases cited by the right hon. Member in support of his case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a clear direction is not forthcoming, we have no alternative as a Committee, if we have any responsibility, but to make it clear by statute that a man must be a married man of 30 with children, before society agrees to give him financial aid to be sterilised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge that to enshrine the principle that the community will subsidise only the married may possibly lead to some marginal hardship to those who are enjoying a stable cohabitation, but who, for some reason may be unmarried. Since the divorce Act with which I am glad to be associated, that situation is less likely than it used to be, and a diminishing number of people would be affected. Nevertheless, there may still be cases where we may regard it as equitable that such people should have a right to subsidised sterilisation. But again, I put it to the Minister and to the sponsor that if we deal with the issue by an unequivocal circular that becomes definitive, it is possible to deal with those exceptions and to allow adjudication to take place in the unusual cases of permanent but unmarried cohabiting unions with children where the parents may be seeking sterilisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that undertaking is not forthcoming
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0063">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
from the Minister, an Amendment of the kind to which I am speaking is essential. Otherwise, if we accepted the view of the right hon. Member, we should be proffering vasectomy, if not inciting vasectomy, to young bachelors, or giving it to people over the age of 30 who were unmarried and never had any intention of marrying. So again, I come back to saying that there must be either an Amendment or a circular which has sufficient elasticity whilst laying down the general principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the questions of marriage and of age, there is the question of consent. The hon. Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell) indicated in an intervention this morning that the question of family planning must be an issue which is shared within a family. That is how I understood his interjection. I certainly share that view. My Amendment includes a requirement that before a vasectomy takes place the consent of the wife must be obtained. At one time there was an authoritarian family system in this country, but it is rapidly fading away. It has almost completely faded away in middle class homes, and it is rapidly fading away in working class homes. The notion that the man alone makes the decisions and that the woman must obey is a view which is rapidly vanishing from the British social scene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, Mr. Fitch, no one knows better than you when we see the position of the present miners' strike how that issue is to no small degree determined by the fact that, unlike the position 20 years ago, today a miner finds no shame in his wife working. The fact that his wife is working, no doubt, contributes to what I hope will be the result of that strike. It is symptomatic of the fact that in a society where the family is becoming increasingly egalitarian and democratic and where the wife is working, it would surely be unthinkable for us to believe that on a matter which is vital to the whole future of the family a unilateral decision can or should be taken by the man with the encouragement of the State irrespective of his wife's wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further reason why I believe that either in the Bill or by means of a circular we must have an absolute requirement that in almost every conceivable circumstance the woman must give her free consent. Only by ensuring that that consent is given can we have some certainty that the decision will be discussed by both husband and wife with whoever is seeing them or whoever is going to effect
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
the ultimate operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent weeks distinguished medical voices in this country have warned surgeons to avoid sterilising the little man who is led in by his dominating wife like a lamb to the slaughter. There is no doubt that some wives press their husbands to be sterilised in order to punish them for their misdemeanours. That may sound extravagant, but it is not a personal view. I am glad that the hon. Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford) has returned. This does not come from any American source. It does not even come from a psychiatrist. It comes from the professor of urology of the University of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an article in the 	<i>Nursing Times</i> a little earlier this month he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I think most of us who deal with these patients are particularly anxious not to operate upon the little man who is led in by his dominating wife like a lamb to the slaughter".</p></blockquote>
He further says—and this is relevant to the question of consent—
	<br><blockquote><p>"When it gets known that a surgeon is willing to perform vasectomy, he is obliged to see a number of incredibly peculiar people: peripatetic seamen who wish for a vasectomy while visiting foreign ports: elderly men marrying a young wife who demand the operation because they do not want to be bothered with children, and wives who see in vasectomy a kind of punishment to be visisted upon their husbands for this or that misdemeanour. The rule is steer clear of the lot of them".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phillip Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might interest the Committee to know that, anticipating that that article might be quoted, I talked to Prof. Blandy at great length last night. He authorised me to say that he is fully in support of the Bill as it stands, for reasons which I shall explain later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to take any second-hand conversations. I take what is the authoritative view expressed. Whatever may be said, it is abundantly clear that we are dealing with a phenomenon which makes it highly important that before the operation is performed we find a technique whereby the husband and wife are seen. I do not doubt that the sponsor of the Bill would want that. We want them both to be seen together, so that situations such as this can be avoided. If one has something in the form of a consent which is taken seriously, it will be almost impossible for the operation to take place without the whole familial situation being assessed.

The view expressed by the professor
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0064">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
of urology is not an idiosyncratic one. It comes from his own experience. I received a letter yesterday from a consultant psychiatrist, not in America but in one of our leading teaching hospitals. He said that he had seen the report of my speech about vasectomy in Parliament last week and wrote to support my views. He writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have a patient in my ward at the moment who has been trying to persuade her husband to have a vasectomy for highly pathological reasons, and fortunately he has been able to resist her pressures. It would certainly be a disaster were he to have the operation and in fact he has already been referred to a surgeon by the family doctor, and has fortunately procrastinated about going".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Finsberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member tell us the name of the professor and the hospital?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The letter goes on about another case and I would rather show the hon. Member and any other hon. Members the letter afterwards on a confidential basis, because I should not refer to a hospital where a man is currently in a ward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman agree that there are 70,000 doctors, 20,000 of whom are general practitioners each with over 3,000 patients, and that amongst those 70,000 one might even find doctors who believed in the flat earth? Is the opinion of one man particularly relevant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I learnt one thing a long time ago: when Maxim Gorky was ill he wrote to Lenin who told him that he should go to a hospital, but not to a Bolshevik doctor. As a political lawyer, I know that if there are any lawyers—or doctors—who should be closely scrutinised when giving their views, it is the political ones, not the ones outside. When doctors or lawyers come to a Committee they should remember that they are not here in their professional capacity but as politicians. Their peers will weigh their views, and while taking their professional qualifications into account they will also be aware that they are sports in the professional field.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member refers to the first of the leading articles in this week's 	<i>British Medical Journal</i>, he would agree, I think, that it is very unlikely that it is written by a political doctor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not wander too far. Last week the hon. Member tried to discredit all the evidence from the psychiatrists in America, and he is now attempting a similar demolition job, which does him little credit, against men like the professor of urology or this consultant in a teaching hospital, who have no motivation beyond their desire to assist the Committee to shape the Bill responsibly so that it will do good, not harm. The hon. Member should try to contain his population fanaticism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This consultant psychiatrist indicated the danger in the wife taking this line. I am suggesting that if the necessity for the husband and wife to be seen together is inbuilt in our procedure, the best way to do it is to obtain consent and then these problems would have a focus: by means of the consent there would be a form of screening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, the wife of this consultant psychiatrist is also a consultant psychiatrist, and the letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My wife has an even more tragic patient at…"</p></blockquote>
and he mentions another famous London teaching hospital—
	<br><blockquote><p>"a man of twenty-eight, who has had a vasectomy, whose marriage has broken up, and who wants to remarry. In his case, too, the motivation for vasectomy was highly abnormal".</p></blockquote>
He also says at the end of his letter:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If this has happened when the operation is relatively in its infancy, one cannot help wondering how common such problems may become as the operation is undertaken more frequently".</p></blockquote>
That is a responsible view. I did not solicit the letter. He and his wife in two different teaching hospitals currently have these patients who are of the type about which the Committee has been expressing concern—a 28-year-old and another man whose wife would appear to be of the type to which the professor of urology called our attention. All of us—particularly those in favour of the Bill—want to take every possible step to prevent disasters like this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I ask that there should be consent by statute, I recognise that there could be exceptional circumstances where consent could be a difficulty. I accept that. After the Divorce Act, where we had the problem of consent—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0065">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
hon. Member would acknowledge that the withholding of consent unreasonably might be just as likely an act of revenge as the situation which he had postulated of a wife forcing somebody to have this operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree and I have it in mind in considering the possible exceptions. We have had this difficulty in the Divorce Act where the question of consent would come into issue with a Catholic, who may feel that by giving consent he is committing himself. They may not object if they do not have to commit themselves by a formal signed authority. This problem exists among those who hold religious beliefs strongly, and a similar type of problem could occur where a man wanted a vasectomy and the woman would not object but could not bring herself to sign a formal consent. This is a dilemma, but I am not prepared—and nor, I think, would the House be—to agree that in the generality husbands unilaterally, irrespective of their wives' wishes, could have a vasectomy. I do not think that that would be tolerated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Finsberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Fitch. Surely the hon. Gentleman's argument now is in direct conflict to the fact that the House having given a Second Reading to the Bill as it is proves that his point is out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have heard nothing out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged. I do not want to make debating points for the hon. Member for Hampstead (Mr. Finsberg), because the House will decide the details. The House gave agreement to the principle of vasectomy. I do not want to patronise a new Member, but the role of the Committee is to scrutinise the details.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Finsberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman tried that argument about new Members in the House and was roundly slapped down by many older Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member will have to learn the hard way since he is not prepared to learn the kind way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accept the Amendment and say by statute that consent must be obtained, there may be a small minority of cases involving hardship. If we do not accept the Amendment the Bill will be unacceptable to the women's organisations, who
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
certainly will not agree that husbands alone should decide whether a vasectomy can take place and that, in those circumstances, the State and the ratepayers should be able to give an irate husband whatever he wants, irrespective of the wife's wishes. I do not think that the country or the House, when faced with that situation, would find it acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the point that I have been trying to weave through all my contributions this morning. If the Minister does not want a rigid framework to encase the Bill in order to protect the overwhelming majority, he must give sufficient direction to enable the general principle to be maintained in terms of a proper age, of a marriage and of a family being in existence before the vasectomy is carried out, and to keep to that principle whilst maintaining elasticity to deal with the minority of cases of people who may, for some special reason, have only one child, who may not be able to obtain consent but who would be justified in having a vasectomy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I decide whether to press the Amendment standing in my name I want to hear from the Minister and I want to hear the view of the hon. Member for Derby, North. My belief, which is strengthened as our proceedings continue, is that there should be, by way of circular, some form of referral point in special cases for people who may have psychiatric or physical contra-indications. A view seems to be emerging from the Committee that a man should be referred by his own general practitioner, who should be involved in questions affecting family life—and, similarly, that there should be a general principle that the age must be 30 or more, the man must be married, must have the consent of his wife, and he must have some children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can do it if there is sufficient sophistication in the Department. It can all be done if there is a clear indication by way of a properly framed circular. The Department of Health put forward its last family planning circular some months ago. That circular—36/71—went into considerable detail on the issues of family planning, gave general directions, and some detailed directions. The Department can take a great deal of pride in that circular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Something similar could avoid the difficulties that these Amendments are bound to create, and in the long run that would make the House and the country happier. It would give an opportunity for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0066">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
us to carry out a pilot experiment between the time of the enactment of this Bill and the time when we reorganise our health service. If the Minister wished to take the initiative—and if the sponsor would agree—we could derive from this short period a great deal of information and guidance which would enable us, in the long run finally to carry out the reorientation of our family planning services within the health services with the maximum amount of wisdom and knowledge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Social Services (Mr. Michael Alison)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start by referring to Amendment No. 2, which is grouped with the Amendment to which the hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) has just spoken. It deals with the question whether the sponsor's original intention of putting an age limit in non-medical cases should be adhered to, or whether the suggestion of the right hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) that we should not impose any limit for non-medical cases, should be preferred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government would prefer to preserve a position of complete neutrality in non-medical cases. There are strong arguments on both sides, to which I have listened with interest. We shall study them further. As I have said before, my right hon. Friend is at present engaged in a thorough-going scrutiny of the present and prospective practice of family planning, and he would not want to make up his own mind until his own review was complete and we had carefully weighed the arguments on both sides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have one or two suggestions and criticisms to make on the Amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Bedwelty (Mr. Kinnock), further amended by the hon. Member for Pontypool. My right hon. Friend and I do not object to the requirement that the wife should give her consent; indeed, it is extremely unlikely that a doctor would operate without such consent being ascertained, or the circumstances surrounding the availability or non-availability of such consent being carefully considered. When I talk about the possible guidance that we may give local authorities I shall have something to say on the aspect of the wife's consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot see any good reason to deny local authorities the opportunity for paying for vasectomy operations to be performed on medical grounds when the patient is
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
under 30; in fact, it will reassure the Committee to know that we envisage that the majority of medical operations will almost certainly be performed on older men in hospitals. However, there may be occasions when local authorities themselves feel the need to arrange for a vasectomy operation on medical grounds—for example, if there is a particularly pressing case and for some reason the hospital waiting list is a real impediment. On those occasions, limited though they may be, we would not want the operation to be restricted, in the terms of the Amendment, to those who are over 30 years of age.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still do not understand. Do I gather from the Minister that when the word "medical" is used, it means" medical," and does not attempt to import any social grounds. Is the provision really and strictly confined to medical grounds. I accept that the provision is meant to be confined to medical grounds, but if it means that doctors are to take social decisions on medical grounds, as they complain they are doing under the abortion law today, I should take a different view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an area in which it is extremely difficult to be categoric. I concede without hesitation that there is an overlap area—a twilight area—in which it is extremely difficult to specify what amounts to a medical ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, for the purposes of advising the Committee on the Bill as it stands, let me point out that there may be occasions when a young man of, say, 25 is married to an older woman for whom a further pregnancy could produce a straight medical hazard. In those circumstances, we would wish that the original intention of the sponsor of the Bill, namely, that the age bar on medical grounds should not exist, should be the form in which the Bill emerges from the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The restriction of the operation to those who are married, which is also found in the two Amendments we are now speaking to, would preclude single men who had a stable relationship with a woman who had completed her family. Again, it would seem unreasonable that, simply by the specification of the word "married" in the Amendment, we should make things particularly awkward for those who had a stable relationship and whose relationship
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0067">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
was recognised in a number of different ways, particularly in social security, where it is a condition that is accepted for certain facilities in our legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirement that the man should have at least two children would not only exclude men who, though eligible on other grounds, were married to women who had already by a previous marriage had children, and were therefore not intending to have children themselves—and it would seem to be unreasonable to exclude them—but would also produce very severe problems of enforceability. Every practitioner would have to check not only that the couple had two children, but that the two children were alive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I touch on these difficult, anomalous by-products of the Amendments which might arise merely to underline the point that the hon. Gentleman the Member for Pontypool himself made so eloquently, that the more we look into this matter the more we find that there are so many special cases likely to arise at the margin that to cover them adequately in the Bill would require a degree of detail, rigidity, technicality and minuteness of drafting which would I believe render the Bill extremely clumsy and almost certainly ineffective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to the point that the hon. Member for Pontypool made. There is an alternative, and it lies in intelligent and intelligible guidance against the general framework of what the Bill provides, against the general range of expressions of Members on both sides of the Committee who are concerned and against the precedent of the circulars, to which the hon. Member for Pontypool has referred, on family planning which have already gone out and which can, as we know, be both intelligent and intelligible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Committee to seize the alternative that I think the hon. Gentleman was hinting at, namely, that if we can find a satisfactory means of conveying Parliament's and the Committee's misgivings and anxieties on a number of special cases in a form which does not require us to write them into the Bill in minute detail, then we would perhaps reassure ourselves and the communisty at large.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I can do at this stage is to give the Committee a firm undertaking that we shall consider sympathetically and carefully every comment which has been made and every reference to outside
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
parties or individuals who have written to the hon. Gentleman, to his hon. Friends and to my hon. Friends, pointing out difficulties and special cases. We shall read carefully the publicity that has been given valuably to those in the Committee, and we shall consider all the arguments in relation to the wife's consent, the implications of that consent being withheld, the question of the age, and so on. We shall see, between now and Report, the extent to which we can properly advise local authorities on these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The broad headings under which we would consider trying to give advice to local authorities would be, first, on the pre-eminent need for counselling, and, secondly, on the desirability in general terms of limiting these operations, or the sponsorship of these operations, to married couples or, by way of alternative, to those who have a stable relationship, and to those who have completed their families. We shall also consider all the variations on these themes which have arisen from comments and misgivings Members have expressed, which may not fit into these two or three broad categories, and see whether we can give further guidance if it is necessary and proper to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of ways in which one can communicate with local authorities, which have both administrators and medical personnel. We shall consider carefully the best ways of communicating and we shall see what form of words, if any, we can propose on Report. I can give a firm commitment that either I or my right hon. Friend will, on Report, be more specific and forthcoming than I am able to be at present against the background of the general undertakings I have given to Committee this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee must be extremely grateful to my hon. Friend for saying what he has. However, one thing which worries some hon. Members is that there has not been anything like enough research done on the problem of the effects of this operation upon patients. I do not believe it can be said of any operation that it is a "safe operation". This is a comparatively safe operation as operations go. The effects upon the minds of people after some years of this operation have not been studied. What the Simon Trust says is nonsense from that point of view. Its studies were based only on the effects of the operation over one or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0068">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would my hon. Friend agree to sponsor some study into the effects of the vasectomy operation on people before the Department issues any information about what the Minister has spoken about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I can give my hon. Friend that undertaking, for the reason which will become more and more obvious to him if he ponders the question. On what I might call the surgical or purely anatomical side of the operation there is, as the techniques of the operation have evolved over a period, an increasing body of specialised and technical knowledge. There is also, because the operation has been available for many years under the National Health Service and in hospitals, a wide range of experience in what one might call the counselling angle. It cannot be avoided when hospitals consider whether it is proper for them to perform the operation. They have to establish whether the grounds are medical and social.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inherent in the present situation is a filter involving consultation between the general practitioner and the patient before referral can be made to a hospital. As a result of our debates in Committee, and as a result of the guidance which we may seek to give to local authorities, there will be a further impetus to the broad question of counselling, particularly perhaps in the social field which, in default of the provision provided under the Bill, will not hitherto have existed. This will be a net additional asset which will accrue to the community when we come to consider how the State as a whole, when it achieves full responsibility, must handle the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is dealing with a highly controversial matter. Of course it is true to say that experience has been gained of vasectomy operations. I repeat that this is a highly controversial matter, and it must be the first matter of this sort upon which any Government have considered taking action and bringing into their health services without making a proper study of the consequences of the operation on the minds of the people—not just the medical or surgical consequences of the operation itself. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South dilated on this at some length. The Minister may say that there is a wealth of experience in
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
performing the operation and that is true, but nothing is known about the effect of it on a person's mind. The Minister cannot refer to a report which says that we ought to issue these instructions to local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am content that we have enough knowledge of both the social and physical by-products of this operation from the wide experience which the National Health Service has had of it, to enable local authorities to sponsor these operations with more or less the same degree of equanimity with which they have been regarded in the hospital service, particularly since the life of the Bill will be short.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not my hon. Friend agree that we have considerable knowledge of the disadvantages of having no family planning, and that this attempt to extend the National Health Service (Family Planning) Act is probably being made as a last resort to help the situation? We know what happens if there is insufficient family planning in many groups, and these groups have been studied very extensively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is discussing a Private Member's Bill, but the Government are interested in it and have given it some sort of blessing, though not a very definite one. The Government are now talking about issuing guidance to local authorities, but the Department has produced no evidence to support their view. All the Minister can say is that the Department has considerable knowledge of the matter. That is fine, but I ask the Minister to share his considerable knowledge with us by producing a more up to date and far better report than the Simon Trust Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no doubt that professional advisers to the local authorities will be able to draw upon the same corpus and body of expert knowledge as is available to the Government. There is no need to present the information formally to Parliament. It is an evolving body of knowledge which goes forward all the time. We have no misgivings about local authorities not being fully apprised and informed, by the kind of public documents to which reference has been made in the Committee, or of the views of eminent
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0069">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>117</span>
practitioners, which have been conveyed today by the hon. Member for Pontypool, and which will be conveyed by other experts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no part of the Government's job, in the context of the Bill, to give a still snapshot of the degree and extent of technical knowledge in this matter. It is evolving and moving forward all the time. Professional people are responsible for producing the information and familiarising themselves with it, and it would be improper for the Government to explain to professional people what they should absorb in the way of specialised knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give my hon. Friend this assurance. In the guidance to be given to local authorities we are seeking to go as far as we possibly can to reflect, and to convey and explain to them the whole range of misgivings and anxieties which hon. Members have expressed, either on their own behalf, or to which they have given voice and publicity through references which have been made to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope my hon. Friend will accept that on Report we hope to come forward with something more specific about the sort of line we should take—I shall not go further than that at this stage—in order to make quite sure that we have absorbed all that we can of the views of the Committee on these matters. I therefore urge the Committee, from the point of view of my Department. Whatever view the Committee may take of the Amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton), I ask hon. Members to reject without hesitation the Amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Bedwelty (Mr. Kinnock), supported by the hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his statement, but I should like to question him a little further on the specifics of what he has in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will bear with me if I deal first with the Amendments which have been discussed, I think in a useful and friendly way, so far. I should like to deal first with the one which I have least hope of seeing withdrawn, because I do not think that any words of mine will weigh with the proposers of it, and is Amendment No. 3. The hon. Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell) does not think that this is a wrecking Amendment. No doubt
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
in Yarmouth they have a greater knowledge of wrecks than I have. Although he could have come here and said that the operation should be limited to men of 95 and over—no doubt with the personal consent of His Holiness the Pope—I think that he has gone about as far as he can to limit this operation to the point at which it would be impossible to obtain the knowledge which he is asking the Committee to study before it goes into the longer-term legislative consequences of what we are doing in the Bill. Is the hon. Gentleman really suggesting that with all its imperfections, and bearing in mind the abuses which have come to my attention, we should stand by and wait for the private sector to perform vasectomies over the next five, ten or fifteen years on those who have money and demand them, without conditions, in a shady way, and at the end of that time study the consequences of the operation? I am sure that he is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is possible that the hon. Gentleman is wrong about this. It is possible that the Amendment was put down for the very reasons he has suggested. It is possible to regard it, not as a wrecking Amendment, but a helpful one. The hon. Gentleman is wrong to deduce from what I have said that I believe that the private sector should be performing this operation. My line is that it has not even been proved that it is a legal operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is saying that no one should have the operation, he can hardly come to the Committee and say that we should have more evidence about it because, by definition, his proposal would be that the operation should not take place, or should be declared illegal. If, on the other hand, he is saying—and I follow the logic of his intervention in his hon. Friend's speech—that we should have thirty or forty years' experience of the effects of the operation, it is unlikely that we shall get that information if nobody can have the operation before the age of 60.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the argument is that if the House of Commons is to be persuaded that this is a necessary and good Measure it should be provided with the fullest possible information about the effects of this operation? That is reasonable, and I do not think it worthy of the hon. Gentleman to have made that observation on my hon. Friend's case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I withdraw any unworthy observations about the hon Member for Yarmouth. I enjoyed his contribution this morning. I agree that the House of Commons should have the fullest possible information on this matter—or on any other medical matter—before attempts to legislate on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At our last Sitting my right hon. Friend the Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) asked me to explain what is meant by
	<br><blockquote><p>"where the patient has attained the age of thirty years, or otherwise on medical grounds".</p></blockquote>
I must tell him that I am attempting to steer a middle way between those who, like my right hon. Friend, feel that this ought to be a free arrangement, freely entered into, with as few conditions trammelling it as possible, and those who, like my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypool, believe that careful safeguards must be associated with the Bill before we are to bring it within the ambit of the National Health Service and the local authorities. After careful consideration I must tell my hon. Friend that in my view the one safeguard that could be put into a statute is an age limit. There is no dispute; a man is 30 or he is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is dispute about what constitutes a family. I shall come to that in a moment. There is dispute on the question of a stable union. There is no dispute about a man's age in those situations where this operation is being performed for contraceptive reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where there is a medical indication—and, by that, I mean taking the generality of medical advice I have received—that the health of either party would be affected by further pregnancies, the age limit is clearly irrelevant and should not apply. I can tell the hon. Member for Barkston Ash (Mr. Alison) that it was not my intention to prevent this operation being carried out on a man under 30 married to a woman of more mature years whose health might be endangered by a further pregnancy. I take that as a clear indication that the operation was necessary on medical grounds. That and most other medical indications come into the phrase "otherwise on medical grounds".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Purely for those who wish to have the operation done on the rates for contraceptive reasons, saying that they, as mature people, have completed their
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
families, for some of the reasons suggested by the hon. Member for Pontypool this morning, on balance it is a good thing to have an age limit to give a pause for consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From his remarks it is clear that inside my hon. Friend is a supporter of the Bill struggling to get out. In spite of all the reservations that I may have had about his use of some of the evidence, that was very clear. He said that he did not want the Bill to be a ram's charter. That is a good headline-catching phrase. He is worried about the low cost of loving—to adapt another of my hon. Friend's phrases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this operation becomes available under the auspices of the local authorities I do not expect that it will become available to what he called young bachelors with immature and narcissistic attitudes. There would be little public or parliamentary support for that. Nor would there be much support for the view that this operation is being carried out as an act of vengeance by old men jealous of the potency of youth. All the evidence that I have seen from those who are conducting the operation leads me to suppose that careful consideration is already given to the age and status of the patient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moving on to the hon. Member for Barkston Ash, and accepting the spirit of the Amendments in the names of my hon. Friends the Members for Bedwellty and Pontypool, I accept the difficulty of saying more than—in the words of Circular 36/71—"The Secretary of State hopes" that certain procedures will be carried out. These procedures should include within their parameters the fact that unless there are exceptional circumstances the patient should be in a stable union where there is free consent of both parties, should have a family, should be screened for physical and psychiatric contra-indications, and should have access to follow-up counselling and medical care, if necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the last category this is already happening. The very nature of the vasectomy operation makes it necessary for the patient to come back over a period of months for various tests, to see whether the operation has been successful. That, combined with a counselling and advice follow-up service, is probably provided already, but it does no harm to under-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
line the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept the precise wording of my hon. Friends' Amendments. I join with the Minister in asking them to withdraw them. Failing that, I ask the Committee to reject them. They would put an unacceptable limitation on the conditions under which the operation can be performed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock) is not here this morning, but I have discussed with him the problems of Amendment No. 4. I think that he would now agree that a problem arises which my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypool mentioned this morning—in inserting the matter of marriage. Stable unions should be the area that we are talking about. There are situations in which a man is separated from his wife, where the wife will not give her consent, and where, if the consent of the legal wife—whom the man may not have seen for 10 or 15 years—is required, the withholding of that consent can be a far more serious act of revenge than the situations he has postulated. In those circumstances it would be unwise to insert the provision of a marriage certificate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same considerations apply in relation to children—two or more children. In normal circumstances there should be an indication that the couple concerned has a family. Clearly, there are medical indications which would make it highly undesirable that the couple should have complied with this provision, but such situations are already covered by the availability, in certain limited categories, of this operation under the National Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to the normal couple one cannot go further than to say that one would expect evidence of a family. If one stipulates a family of two children, must they be two living children? Must they be two children, each conceived and born to this couple? What about stepchildren? What about adopted children? Do we count an unborn child, if the wife is pregnant at the time of the application? If so, and a reference to two children is written into the statute, what happens if the unborn child miscarries? It is impossible to write into the statute a numerical provision relating to children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of what I have said this morning, and in view of the assurances from
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
the Minister about the parameters within which advice should be offered to the local authorities on the normal circumstances for this operation, I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw the Amendment. In view of what I said to my right hon. Friend the Member for Sowerby about my clear understanding that "otherwise on medical grounds" means wherever there is a medical indication in the health of either partner giving his or her free and valid consent to the operation, I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw the Amendment and let the one other qualification—the limitation of age on those who come forward for contraceptive reasons only—remain in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead) detected in the hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) a supporter of the Bill struggling to get out. In me the hon. Gentleman may observe an opponent of the Bill struggling to say something helpful to the Committee. I promise that my speech will not be long. It will probably be the shortest of the morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the third in this group of Amendments stands in my name it is proper for me to say a word or two about it and also to refer to the other Amendments. Three out of four Amendments reflected the disquiet that many of us feel about this operation, and the need to keep it within bounds. There should be a limitation on the extent of the operation. One does not know where it will end. My hon. Friend, the Minister, with his usual courtesy and conscientiousness, spoke with equanimity—I think that was his word—about the advice that he had received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know what happened with the Abortion Act, and the advice received on that occasion from the Department. We know that the Lane Committee is examining that Act. No one wants anything to go through the House which will be regretted afterwards by those who were most anxious to see the Bill enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Pontypool, in a most eloquent speech defended the most basic human rights of parenthood. He also defended the basic dignity of the human being—the man whose dignity de-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0072">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
rives in large part from his natural prowess.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Willesden, West (Mr. Pavitt) has just left. At the last meeting of the Committee he seemed to think that I was not concerned about the rights of the woman. I am passionately concerned for the rights of the woman. I thought that the hon. Member for Pontypool spoke extremely well for the dignity of womanhood and the equal rights of the married woman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been described as well-nigh a wrecking Amendment. It cannot be a wrecking Amendment, since it would not be on the Order Paper if it were. It is a serious Amendment, on a serious matter. This operation is irreversible, and carries many moral, medical, social and demographic implications, We must be sure that it is carried out upon persons who voluntarily give their consent to the operation, acting in a mature and rational way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not lay any great stress on the choice of the age of 60; nor does my hon. Friend the Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell). I had a frivolous picture in my mind of a sixtieth-birthday party with everybody singing, "Happy birthday to you", with a second stanza, running, "Happy vasectomy to you".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am stressing the state of mind of the man who gives his consent to the operation. We are subject to influences at all ages, and some older people are more susceptible to influences than are younger people. On the whole, young people are perhaps less susceptible to the influence of statutory authority than they used to be, but they are, nonetheless, susceptible to propaganda, advertising and fashion. The fashions of today favour vasectomy. This is an age when what Lewis Mumford has called the "cult of anti-life" is in the ascendant—a cult which I believe to be debasing human dignity, human love and human sexuality; which is only a truly human sexuality; the context of a loving relationship. This is the faction of the times and the social pressure of today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard some somewhat explosive interjections from my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford). I do not know whether he is in any way connected with the Doctors' Overpopulation Group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is connected with the Doctors' Over-population Group. This is one example of the pressure that is being brought to bear on people. This is a normal and proper thing. We want to protect people from undue influences of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dr. George Morris, the secretary of this group, is stated as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It seems to be snowballing".</p></blockquote>
that is the disquiet in the minds of those of us who have tabled three of the four Amendments—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Suddenly it has become a mass-movement-This is the first time I know that a significant number of doctors has banded together on a social problem rather than a medical one.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>When doctors begin banding together on a 'social problem'—that is, begin claiming the right, with the connivance and support … of public authority … to influence and control private behaviour and private life".</p></blockquote>
and so on. I mention to show that powerful influences are being exerted on the minds of the sort of men who might request the operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beseech the Committee to view with favour, both the Amendment put forward by hon. Gentleman opposite and the Amendment tabled in the name of myself and my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Shirley Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a few comments on the Bill in an individual capacity. As I pointed out in the Second Reading debate, the Opposition, like the Government, are neutral on this point. The Committee is agreed that the consent of husband and wife should be necessary. That is the situation when the operation is carried out in hospital, and when it is carried out under the auspices of the Family Planning Association. I do not see any reason for it to be different when the operation is carried out more generally under a local authority when the Bill is enacted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most interested in what the hon. Lady has just said. Is this consent statutory or just a matter of practice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I imagine that the hospital operation is regarded as statutory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not true to say that the hospitals, the doctors and the F.P.A. are not only trying to protect the marriage, but also the anxiety over civil
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0073">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
damages which might occur. That is what is governing the situation and it ought not to. Would not the hon. Lady agree that we cannot make this statutory because of the arguments raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Barkston Ash (Mr. Alison)?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not always know where the wife is. She may have disappeared, or there may be some other reason why the wife cannot be found, or will not give her permission; the relationship may have irretrievably broken down—the five years may not have elapsed—so that one could not have a statutory regulation of this sort existing. Existing practice has worked extremely well in hospitals, with vasectomy and the sterilisation of women. We should continue to do everything that we can to preserve these customs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman that a similar situation would arise in hospitals when one operates on children. Sometimes there is an emergency and one cannot contact the parents for their consent. In general, every effort is made to obtain consent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. In the Bill as it stands the phrase "voluntary vasectomy" is used. The word "voluntary" means "full and valid consent". In normal circumstances that means the full and valid consent of both parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whenever one carries out any operation it is difficult to lay down rules that the operation, whatever it may be, can be carried out only if a person is above a certain age, if he has a certain marital status, or if he has certain definite health requirements or a disease that makes it necessary. One can lay down guiding principles to be followed by surgeons when they perform any operation. Often they cannot comply with all eight of the guiding rules, but each patient is looked upon separately. His individual circumstances are assessed, and he may cover seven of the eight guiding rules. It is up to the surgeon in each case to decide whether there is sufficient indication to carry out the operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it would be advisable not to incorporate these rules of marital status, number of children, and conditions, into the Bill, and that we should, on the other hand, make every effort to set out guiding rules
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
for local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will always be some mistakes as a result of any surgical operation. No surgical operation is 100 per cent. safe. None is 100 per cent. successful. There will always be somebody who will regret such an operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee of the conditions of hysterectomy in women. That is not regarded as sterilisation. That operation is widely carried out. It sterilises women, but there is no set of legal rules to define those on whom it should be performed. Each patient is assessed according to her circumstances—her age, the number of her children, and her marital status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is surely not suggesting that hysterectomy has been carried out for contraceptive purposes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, but it has the effect of sterilising a woman. Therefore, it is an extremely serious operation to carry out on a woman—as is vasectomy carried out on a man. They both have the result of sterilising the individual. I am pointing out that it is difficult to lay down rules, particularly in legislation, about the conditions to be complied with before an operation like this is carried out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no possible connection between any sort of hysterectomy—major or other; I do not know the technical terms—and vasectomy. Surely no one will go into hospital and have a hysterectomy operation for other than necessary health purposes? Is not that true?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the hon. Gentleman would agree that the two operations are connected, in that the one result of both operations is the sterilisation of the individual for life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course. I really must talk to my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South, so that he can inform me on these matters, but surely it is true that no woman has a hysterectomy in order to make herself infertile?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not what I am saying. I merely said that that was one result of a hysterectomy. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it would be preferable to put out as clearly and as comprehensively as possible all the issues that

	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
have been raised in Committee, but it would be difficult, and very confusing in the long run, to put it all into legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>, That Clause 1, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Clause as it now stands is most unfortunate, and that an ill-considered result has been achieved. This is one of the occasions on which I am bound to say that a Committee which has too many new Members on it seems to be calculated to frustrate what may be the intention of those Members. I am not suprised that the hon. Member for Dorking (Sir G. Sinclair) dithered when the votes were being taken, for he well realises the consequences which flow from what the Committee has done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite a most helpful intervention by the Minister which would have caused me to withdraw my Amendment in the light of the promissory note, which he carefully spelt out, indicating that the Government felt—as the House and any responsible Government must feel—that there was a need for some precautions, we now have a Clause which does away with the need for any reservations at all. I congratulate the right hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) on having wrecked a Bill which could have been most useful to the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am certain that none can tolerate the idea that there should be a Bill in which there are literally no reservations—because that is the effect of the Committee's decision—despite the intentions of the sponsor of this Measure. Nobody is more dismayed about that than the sponsor of the Bill, who has been operating today with great tact and has shown great sensitivity for the opinions of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now have a Clause, which con-</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
	<p>	<i>Question put</i>, That the Amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 4.</p>
	<p>tains no safeguards at all by which the doctrine advanced by the right hon. Member for Sowerby that the rights of bachelors, of the young, and of adults should be absolutely untrammelled—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Houghton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not said anything of the sort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the consequence of the Clause as it now stands. The right hon. Member made his view quite clear when he moved his Amendment, and it has had its impact upon the Clause. He said on that occasion:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But so long as we regard the right of procreation as one of the basic human rights with which no one must interfere—God-given and something everybody must be able to do for themselves without let or hindrance—so long as this is the public attitude, we shall not have a sensible approach …".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee C</i>, 9th February, 1972; 	<i>c.</i> 95.]</p></blockquote>
The right hon. Gentleman went on to make it quite clear—and he has had his way in the Clause as it now is—that people should be able to have this operation without what he regarded as unnecessary cajoling and supervision, which he indicated it was the fashion in society to regard as undesirable. That was his point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government, through the Minister, have made it clear that they want a Bill which is accompanied by some intelligent and suitable guidance and advice. I do not believe that any Government could maintain their neutrality and allow a Bill to go through with a Clause which, in as clear terms as can be stated, lays it down that the House is not to be able to exercise the kind of the supervision which the Minister has indicated should, in some form or other, be embodied in a circular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to add to the morass. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0075">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>129</span>
want to see whether there is a way of getting out of it. I hope that those who supported the Amendment—without sufficient thought I believe—and left the Clause in this condition will think again, I hope that the scrutiny which the Minister has indicated is being to the misgivings which have been expressed will result in the potential—it can be no more than that in the light of the Clause before us—availability of a counselling circular or circulars. I hope that those who are responsible for this will, in order to save the Bill be ready on Report to make certain that it is in a form identical to that intended by the sponsor or, if the safeguard about the age of 30 is left out, will reinforce and supplement its provisions by the circular which the Minister has in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always wanted a Bill which gave a man the right to have a vasectomy, subject to adequate safeguards. Through no fault of the sponsor, and against his wishes, a Clause has been accepted which can give comfort only to all those who really do not have the long-term interests of family planning at heart. I am confident that the House will not accept this Clause on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) has failed to tell us how the amended Clause will wreck the Bill—unless he intends to wreck it himself. The Clause as amended means that we shall rely upon the good sense of those who carry out this operation, reinforced by the circular from the Ministry, and their knowledge reinforced by education from the Ministry. We are realising a basic truth of life which, it may not be apparent to the older Members of the House, is apparent to the younger Members, and that is that what matters in the practice of medicine is that everybody is different, and the fewer statutory provisions there are governing their treatment the better. The more we rely upon good common sense, backed up by education, the better will be family planning, the better will be married life, the better will be society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has nothing to do with wrecking Bills. It is not a technical point which we are introducing to please Parliamentarians who have forgotten what life is like. The Amendment has been made so that greater discretion may be used and larger numbers of people may have
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
this measure as a last resort when other family planning measures have fallen down. If the hon. Member for Pontypool intends to wreck the Bill because it is not in the words he would have liked, he will be wrecking it, not for himself, but for those outside this House who look to him for leadership and not pedantics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we should look at one or two of the points raised by the hon. Gentleman this morning. Let us consider this business of the ram's charter. It is a wonderful phrase, one which will be on every hoarding, and probably on stickers, too. It is a phrase which would do justice to a copywriter, rather than to a social worker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If anything was likely not to make it a ram's charter, it was the intervention of the Minister and the assurances of the sponsor of the Bill. What is most likely to make the Bill a ram's charter is the Clause as it now stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's speech will in no way be nullified by the alteration of the Clause. In fact, we now rely upon the Minister more than we did before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was one grave discrepancy in what the hon. Member for Pontypool said about a ram's charter. At one moment he said that the Bill would remove our potency and virility, and at the next moment he said that 18-year-olds would be queueing up so that they could join the great parade of rams. He was suggesting that although they were stripped of their manhood and virility, in some way they would be better as rams. It must be a rare breed of ram which they breed in Wales, but I think that it would have little appeal elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Member is carried away by his own enthusiasm may I ask him to recognise that there are a number of attitudes to the question of a young man being sterilised. The hon. Gentleman may think that it is a casual matter, and one for jokes, that an 18-year-old should have a right to a vasectomy on the rates, which is what the Clause would permit. He may think giving approval to a Clause of this kind is a responsible act. I regard it as thoroughly irresponsible, and something which the hon. Gentleman will rue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0076">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A young man may have the right to ask for a vasectomy. But it is most unlikely that he will get it. He has the right now to ask to be castrated, but it is most unlikely that his doctor will allow it. When I practised in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell), many Catholic patients asked for hysterectomies in order that they might be rendered infertile.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How many?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Four or five probably. I did not agree to the operation. Patients ask for many things, but because they ask it does not necessarily mean that they get what they want. It is most unlikely that the operation will be permitted if the conditions for it are unsuitable. That is why the conditions to be laid down, and the worries and anxieties have to be considered before the operation is allowed, must be a matter for the medical profession. That in no way nullifies the excellent safeguards which have been put forward today by my hon. Friend the Member for Barkston, Ash (Mr. Alison). Any attempt to wreck the Bill will be pure vindictiveness, and totally antisocial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with some interest to the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South. Of course he has experience of my constituency. Of course one would be interested to see the histories of the cases to which he has referred. One would be interested to see precisely what happened in those cases. But I have no idea what happened, so I can say no more about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have listened to a speech of great certitude, great power and unassuming logic, made from my hon. Friend's vast experience over many years as a doctor concerned with these matters. However, in spite of his vast experience and certitude in all these matters, and in spite of his admitted interest in them, his speech did not convince me one jot or tittle. The speech that interested me, and apparently appalled my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South, was that of the hon. Member for Pontypool.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: His second speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does my hon. Friend mean by "His second speech"? If my hon. Friend wants to interrupt, I am not hesitant to give way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that not only has the acceptance by the Committee of the Amendment put down by the right hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) wrecked the Bill, but it has made the position of the Ministry intolerable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Houghton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is all very well for the right hon. Member to yell "Rubbish" from a seated position. I remember him saying other things last week. I shall not do him the discourtesy of quoting one or two of the more virulent parts of his speeches, either last week or the week before, but I will quote one or two of the points that he made in his speech on the Amendment:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… so long as we regard the right of procreation as one of the basic human rights with which no one must interfere—God-given and something everybody'—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Houghton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have just had this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. The right hon. Member seems to be making speeches constantly from a seated position. Since in his absence we have had an extraordinarily calm meeting, perhaps he will observe the normal rules, despite the fact that he is a Privy Councillor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member can leave the matter to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That, I am sure, is absolutely correct. You are running this Committee, Mr. Fitch, in a manner which is most becoming and helpful to the Committee. However, it is intolerable, after the speeches we listened to last week and the week before, for the hon. Member for Sowerby to sit there making loud rude interjections, not even asking to interrupt, knowing that I would willingly give way to him despite the fact that he refuses point blank to give way to any Member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will continue to quote from the right hon. Gentleman's speech, which he apparently did not wish me to do:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But so long as we regard the right of procreation as one of the basic human rights with which no one must interfere—God-given and something everybody must be able to do for themselves without let or hindrance"—</p></blockquote>
I remember his emphasis on the words "without let or hindrance"—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0077">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>133</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"… so long as this is the public attitude, we shall not have a sensible approach to the state of marriage …".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee C</i>, 9th February, 1972; 	<i>c.</i> 95.]</p></blockquote>
In those words are summed up the views—moral, Christian, and ethical—on the state of marriage of people in society held by the right hon. Member for Sowerby—who behaved in the most gentle and helpful manner to the Committee last week and the week before!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to continue quoting from the right hon. Gentleman's speech as it would become highly tedious. I want to come to the position in which our poor Minister finds himself. Having read the Bill with the greatest care, having shown it to his Department and asked for its views—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is most persistent. I will, of course, give way to him as he is usually so helpful to my case. Is he sure that he will be helpful to my case this time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. Will my hon. Friend make it quite plain why the Amendment which was accepted will cause the Minister to regret one word he said this morning and why the Minister's view should be altered in any way by the Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without in any way wishing to reflect upon the conduct of Members of this Committee, I wish to say that I am a grateful to my hon. and medical Friend for his fourth speech this morning by way of an interruption. Will he forgive me if I resist the temptation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member must return to the Question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, there was no interruption of my hon. and medical Friend when he made a speech. However, I will immediately comply with your wish, Mr. Fitch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister shook his head in defence of what my hon. and medical Friend had said, apparently agreeing with what he was saying and disagreeing with what I am saying. I ask him to think very carefully before he dreams of giving me a reply to the questions I wish to put to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now have, as the hon. Member for Pontypool said, a Bill stripped of
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
two of its basic safeguards. If they were not basic safeguards, then I cannot read English. Perhaps I cannot understand a short one-page Bill like this. Perhaps when I have been here another 20 years I shall understand what words mean in a Bill. The words we have left out and have therefore made the Clause impossible were, if I may restate them in order to re-emphasise this to the Committee:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the patient has attained the age of thirty years, or otherwise on medical grounds"—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Laurie Pavitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have just discussed that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We may have just discussed it, but is the hon. Gentleman saying from a sedentary position that I am not allowed to mention it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pavitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not trying to usurp the functions of the Chair. I am trying to avoid tedious repetition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a clever way of not insulting the Chair. The Chairman will call me to order at the drop of a hat if I indulge in tedious repetition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am listening with diminishing patience to this talk about the conduct of the Chair. Would the hon. Member now return to the Question? He can make passing references to statements made, but he must direct his main argument to the Question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman is seeking to obtain clarification of the consequences after the Minister so ably explained why he appeared to be approving the fact that the phrase "on medical grounds" should be included. I hope that he will ask the Minister whether in any way the circular now, in the light of the fact that it is to be removed from the Bill, if it ever emerges, can become stronger on the question of age. Those are all questions to which he said that he had directed the Minister's attention before the Minister replied. I hope that he will stress them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Pontypool's interjections are always helpful. I am most grateful. The words he has put into my mouth I will leave basically as read, so that the Minister may have the time to reply on the question of the amended Clause and to the serious situation which now faces him in view of his earlier promises to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0078">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>135</span>
The Clause has led to wide-ranging discussion on many subjects. One of them has been the circular which the Minister said would be later sent to all local authorities. Already some hon. Members have wondered on what that circular was to be based. One presumes that one factor would be pointing out the medical grounds, giving reference to age, making reference to the legal situation, and so on. But now all that one is concerned about is that whatever the circular put out by the Minister, the Bill itself is to be a different thing altogether. Presumably, there will be no need for the authorities concerned with the operation to have regard either to an age limit, or otherwise to medical grounds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may help the hon. Member and perhaps abbreviate his remarks if I say at this stage that of course those of us who wish to see the Bill become law will be asking the Minister, in view of the Committee's decision this morning, to incorporate in the circular a provision with regard to age where there is no overwhelming medical indication.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is most helpful. The hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead) has been most helpful all the morning, as the hon. Member for Pontypool remarked. But it does not solve the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the only change in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the only change in the Bill. But at least it was a couple of lines in the Bill which slightly lessened my horror of it. The hon. Gentleman now says that the Minister can include this in the circular. I take leave to doubt whether that is as strong as including it in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was hoping that the hon. Gentleman would say—and I still hope that he can be prevailed upon to do so—that he will incorporate on Report the words now left out of the Clause. It seems to me, not to put it too highly, that with the new Clause with which we are left, the Bill will have fairly ringing and strenuous opposition at later stages, not only from myself because of the new form of the Clause, but also perhaps, although of
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
course I cannot speak for anybody else, from my hon. Friend the Member for Chigwell (Mr. Biggs-Davison) and conceivably from the hon. Member for Pontypool.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is therefore important that the hon. Member for Derby, North should attempt to assuage the fears which have arisen in the Committee since that Amendment seemed to slip through not long ago with doubtful deep thought on the part of one or two of my hon. Friends who appeared to have to go and ask other Members which way, if any, they should vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was a doubtful Amendment from that point of view. It did not seem to have full acceptance from the other side of the Committee. I was astonished, as I am sure the hon. Member for Derby, North, was, when the Amendment was accepted. I can only think that the change in the Clause was the result of the strong, determined and—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member must not repeat arguments that we have heard during the debate on the Amendments. He must relate his remarks to the amended Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely what I am trying to do. We have heard speeches this morning which, due to your kindness, Mr. Fitch, have encompassed many matters. Very few hon. Members are opposed to the Bill, but some of us are. In such circumstances, I think it will not fall upon deaf ears if I appeal to you to allow me where possible to use arguments which are in some way connected with a happening which has taken place recently in the Committee concerning the Clause, which has been altered out of existence by the acceptance of an Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it is because of my poor command of the language and my inability to express myself in such succinct, clear and experienced terms as my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South that I get myself into hot water from time to time and come close to various brinks. I will do my utmost to keep in your good books, Mr. Fitch. Otherwise I shall be in further trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only reason I can think of for the Committee's taking this extraordinary decision a few moments ago, a decision which has so altered the Clause as to make it unrecognisable, was the gallant, strong and forthright speech made at our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0079">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>137</span>
last meeting by the right hon. Member for Sowerby. His speech must have bedazzled the Committee into accepting that odd and destructive Amendment, thereby stripping Clause 1 of the protections we had thought were within it and which gave us some hope that it would not range too wide and too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal once again to the Under-Secretary to tell us what effect this will have on his circular. I must ask again the hon. Member for Derby, North if he would attempt to reverse this decision on Report so that Clause 1 may be more presentable. For myself, though I was much influenced by the kindness and openhandedness of the hon. Gentleman towards the Committee this morning, now that this Amendment has been accepted and we are faced with this extraordinary Clause—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Finsberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask a simple and direct question of my hon. Friend. Will he tell the Committee, without equivocation, whether, if this Amendment were to be reversed at a later stage, he would be for or against the Bill? Let us have just a "Yes" or a "No".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, Mr. Fitch, I am not even sure whether I would be in order were I to attempt to answer that question—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Houghton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should like to know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may well be that people would like to know. People would like to know all sorts of things in this House, and it is an unwise hon. Member who forecasts how he will vote on one day on one issue or the next day on another. The answer to my hon. Friend is that I cannot answer it, because I should be out of order if I attempted to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was trying, as you will recall, Mr. Fitch, when I was interrupted by my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead (Mr. Finsberg)—it is the first time he has interrupted me, so I wanted to try to answer him—to bring my remarks to a conclusion. It is difficult, in the face of interruptions, to do so. I shall make another attempt, while keeping strictly within your generous ruling of the Committee, Mr. Fitch, to bring myself to a conclusion, having, I hope, not kept the Committee beyond a reasonable time when one considers the shock with which
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
we have been faced over the last 25 minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to my hon. Friend the Minister, not to tell us what he will do, but, if he will, to tell us what he will not do. If I may put words in his mouth as to how he may feel he should deal with the situation that has arisen on the Clause, can he at least tell us that he will not tell us anything this morning, but that he will reserve his judgment on the situation now that the guts have been knocked out of part of the Clause? If he will do that, he will assure some of us that he will, as usual, live up to the kindness and farsightedness with which he has treated the Committee on this Private Member's Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Houghton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You reminded us, Mr. Fitch, that the Question is, That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill. That is the issue. It is no good hon. Members trying to re-open the debate on the Amendment which the Committee carried. That Amendment has been made, and it is futile at this stage to continue the discussion on whether that Committee was wise to do what it did. If that question is to be raised, it should not be raised in this Committee, in my judgment, but on the Floor of the House. When we get there, there may be something to be said about the dark hints of the wrath to come which has been uttered by my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse). He has threatened, darkly hinting at least, that he will do to this Bill what the opponents of his divorce Bill did to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order, I have made no such threats or suggestions. Since the right hon. Member refuses to give way, I shall ask the protection of the Chair, for what I have done is try to assist the sponsor and the Minister in getting the Bill to the Statute Book. I wish the right hon. Gentleman would follow my example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Houghton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not pursue that matter any further. We shall see how things turn out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I now for a moment bring the Committee back to a sense of proportion which some of its hon. Members are in danger of losing. What is the difference between the Clause as amended and the Clause before it was amended? One single difference: the deletion of the age of 30 years. It has not made this a ram's charter.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0080">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>139</span>
People who want to have whatever facilities come from a ram's charter need not come to the Bill for them. They need only go to a private doctor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Get them free under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Houghton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a silly remark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Houghton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a silly remark. The point of which hon. Members who consistently oppose the Bill are losing sight is that the discretion rests in the hands of the local authority. It has the right—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Houghton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at four minutes to One.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I hope it is a point of order. Is it in order for a member of the Committee who happens to be the mover of an Amendment which has recently been accepted, and which he told the Committee we should not be discussing, to misquote his own Amendment and say that something does not appear in it when it does?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order for me. The hon. Member surely must know, from his long experience in the House, that if an hon. Member who is speaking does not give way, he cannot interrupt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Houghton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to suggest to the Committee that the world has not come to an end, and the Bill has not by the Amendment been rendered unacceptable to any reasonable person who supports its principles. All that has happened is that the rigidity of Clause 1, which would have been binding upon local health authorities, and in the enforcement of which they might have required the production of proof of age and birth certificates to satisfy themselves that they were not dealing with a person under 30, has been removed. It does not, however, give any licence to unmarried men, to rams or anybody else. It gives no further licence than that which lies within the discretion of the local health authority
	<span class='label label-info column'>140</span>
which has a duty to discharge on behalf of the public and especially of its ratepayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the good of the hon. Member giving the impression that, had the Clause remained unamended, he would have been able to take it more affectionately to his bosom, when Amendments are in the Notice Paper in his name which are positively wrecking Amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Is it not a reflection on the Chair to say that Amendments, in my name or anyone else's, which have been accepted are wrecking Amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Houghton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is an Early Day Motion in the Order Paper in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. The hon. Gentleman seems to be attempting to usurp the functions of the Chair. I raised a point of order and the hon. Gentleman himself tried to answer it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is out of order for any hon. Member to suggest that I have accepted wrecking Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Withdraw.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Houghton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The way of a reformer is very hard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Withdraw.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Houghton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not withdrawing anything. I am trying, as calmly as I can, to give hon. Gentlemen a dose of their own medicine. They are obstructionists, and we shall see this emerge at a later stage of the Bill. In those circumstances, the Committee should do what it is free to do: add the Clause to the Bill and let us get on with the later stages. In that way we might make some progress. But it is no good trying to fight battles over again when the Committee has already reached a judgment on the terms of the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
