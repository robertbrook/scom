<div class='page-header'><h1>NIGHT ASSEMBLIES BILL</h1></div>
<p>10.32 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jerry Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That during the further proceedings on the Night Assemblies Bill, the Committee do meet on Mondays at half-past Four o'clock and on Wednesdays at half-past Ten and half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
I think that a word of explanation may be required, particularly about the proposal to meet on Wednesday afternoons. My hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and Development will in due course be in charge of the Local Government Bill during its Report stage, and the Leader of the House has given some assurances concerning Government Bills in Committee on Wednesday afternoons when the Common Market legislation is being discussed. Therefore, it would be my intention, if the Committee so wished, not to sit on Wednesday afternoons unless it was essential. I am sure that the extra time on Monday afternoons and evenings should allow us to proceed at a reasonable pace.<br><br>
So far, we have reached a decision on only one set of Amendments and it is quite clear that the opposition to the Bill means that we shall require more time. I therefore felt it right to move a Sittings Motion to allow more time, since the Opposition have indicated in the past their support for the general principle of trying to protect both the young people who attend pop festivals and the people living in the areas concerned, so that their intention to amend the Bill must be reasonable. It is clear that they have not been given sufficient time to do that and, in order to ensure that the Bill proceeds through the subsequent stages, I am moving the Sittings Motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As an opponent of the Bill as it stands, and as one who, though he has not spoken often, has endeavoured to secure Amendments genuinely to improve the Bill in order that it shall do what its promoter says he wishes—that is, to protect young people attend-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 146</span>
ing pop festivals and people in the areas concerned—I rise to oppose most strongly this presumptuous Motion. I have tabled Amendments which would achieve the hon. Gentleman's stated aim and, if he would give way on some of the Opposition's Amendments, he could have his Bill in one Sitting. However, he will not.<br><br>
This is only our fourth Sitting. We are speaking of a Bill of eight Clauses, five pages long, not about some massive piece of legislation containing hundreds of Clauses, which might not be able to be dealt with before the Session ended. It is much too early for a Sittings Motion to be moved in the fourth Sitting of a Bill.<br><br>
The Bill is certainly very controversial, as all members of the Committee know from the large amount of correspondence which has been received. However, though controversial, it is certainly not a monumental piece of legislation which it is imperative for the House to pass within a limited time in order to avert dire consequences. There is no sense of emergency about this legislation; yet the hon. Gentleman has moved this Sittings Motion.<br><br>
I agree that any hon. Member who has the good fortune in the ballot to get a Private Member's Bill standing in his name looks upon it as his child and invests it with a degree of importance which, possibly, it does not merit in the eyes of other hon. Members. The hon. Gentleman might truly say of the Bill, "a poor thing, but mine own". It is a very poor thing, but it is the hon. Gentleman's own Private Member's Bill and he is therefore very concerned about it.<br><br>
So far, however, we have had a number of serious Amendments relating to Clause 1, which is the meat of the Bill. Clearly the Committee will spend a long time dealing with Clause 1 because most of the Amendments will relate to it. Therefore, when the hon. Member says that the Committee has dealt with only part of Clause 1, he does not take into account the fact that the bulk of the argument will plainly be on that Clause. The other Clauses are mostly merely consequential.<br><br>
As the Minister knows, this happened on the Local Government Bill, on Which we spent what seemed an inordinate length of time dealing with the boundary schedules because there was a great deal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0196">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 147</span>
of meat and much controversy involved. When we came to subsequent Clauses of that Bill, however, we dealt with 60 or 70 Clauses in a single Sitting. That is how the system works. The Committee discusses in great detail those parts of a Bill which are of substance, and subsequent Clauses go through very quickly. It does not follow that because we have spent such a long time on Clause 1, we shall spend as much on other Clauses. They should go through comparatively quickly.<br><br>
I repeat, however, that the hon. Member should consider some of the Amendments put down by the Opposition. My Amendments, at least, have been designed to help the Bill to carry out the hon. Gentleman's stated objective—that is, to protect those attending pop festivals and the public around them. They would allow local councils to make hygiene regulations without giving them the power to ban festivals. This is where we draw the line. We on this side of the Committee feel that civil liberties are involved here and we feel that if a council has the option it will take the easy road out.<br><br>
I will not go into the merits of my Amendment; I know it would be quite wrong to do so. I am merely using that as an illustration to the promoter of the Bill, on his Sittings Motion, to show how easily his Bill could go through the Committee stage, with a little give and take. Even the Government must give and take on a Bill. The Government, when faced with opposition to a particular Measure, know how far they can go without a certain amount of give and take, and it always reaches the point where, if they are to see their legislation through, they talk with the other side, they discuss, the usual channels meet, agreements are made on various Clauses and on how far they will go.<br><br>
A certain amount of compromise is needed. This is inevitable in this House, because this is a House where a compromise is very often essential, where the intransigent Government or the intransigent Member merely lose the opportunity of getting a Bill through at all. I fear that the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare is in danger of doing this with his Bill, both by the intransigence that he has shown to many of the Amendments in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 148</span>
the past and by the fact that he comes before the Committee on its fourth Sitting and moves a Sittings Motion, not just for Wednesday afternoons but for Monday afternoons as well. He asks for Mondays and Wednesdays on a Bill which consists of only eight Clauses and which is in only in its fourth Sitting.<br><br>
The matter may be of monumental importance to the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare but I seek to show how inconvenient it would be to all members of the Committee in carrying out their duties as Members of this House if we were to sit on Monday and Wednesday afternoons. The purpose of having Standing Committees of the House sitting during the mornings, is simple, that hon. Members can come here during the morning—even though they may have correspondence and constituency work to do—talk about the Bill in question, debate it and amend it properly, and consider it properly line by line.<br><br>
The purpose of having Committees in the mornings and not in the afternoons is to enable hon. Members to do their duty by their constituents in the House of Commons and to do their duty by the House itself during the afternoon. The hon. Member is suggesting by his Sittings Motion that hon. Members who serve on both sides of this Committee should be prevented, if they come up here, from doing their duty in the House itself.<br><br>
The promoter of the Bill mentioned that the Leader of the House—I think he is still the Leader of the House; I do not know whether he is yet the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, a post in which I am sure all hon. Members on both sides of the Committee wish him well—when the House of Commons was considering a piece of Government legislation, an act of Conservative Party policy, the Housing Finance Bill, decided that Committees should not meet on Wednesday afternoons, if the House was considering the European Communities Bill, because this was of overriding and paramount importance. The hon. Gentleman is saying that in his private piece of legislation he can supersede and override what the Leader of the House would not dare to do with hon. Members on a matter of Conservative Party policy, on a Government Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ray Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He is a reasonable man.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0197">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 149</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Leader of the House as my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfields (Mr. Carter) says, is a reasonable man. He realises in his capacity and duty as Leader of the House that it is his duty to protect hon. Members, particularly back-benchers, so that they can carry out their constituency duties. The office of Leader of the House is an all-party office, and it is part of his job to protect back-benchers.<br><br>
I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman, in moving the Sittings Motion, has had words with the Leader of the House. This is a matter where a promoter of a Private Bill should go to the Leader of the House, not as one of his Conservative Ministers, but as Leader of the House of Commons. He should tell him that he intends to ask the Committee to sit when the House is sitting, so that hon. Members, instead of being downstairs on the Floor of the House, will be upstairs discussing his Bill. He should ask him whether he thinks this fair or reasonable, and whether he would accept this as Leader of the House. I feel quite sure that the present Leader of he House would refuse, saying that he does not think it fair and reasonable.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman said when he moved his Sittings Motion, the House is debating and will be debating after Easter the European Communities Bill on at least two days a week. This is one of the most important pieces of legislation affecting this country, where every hon. Member from both sides of the Committee will be concerned to be present in the Chamber, to listen to the debates and later on to put forward Amendments relating to his own constituency. The Leader of the House appreciated this fact, so that he was prepared to delay a piece of Conservative Party legislation, so far as Committee Sittings were concerned in order that hon. Members could be present in the debate on the Common Market.<br><br>
The European Communities Bill and the Common Market debate will take place on two days a week at the very times that the hon. Gentleman wants us to be up here in the Committee. The debates will be held on two days a week, possibly on Mondays and Wednesdays. Certainly I would say that Wednesday is a likely day. It is no use the hon. Gentleman coming to the Committee and saying that if he finds that it clashes with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 150</span>
the business of the House we will not have a Sitting. It is up to the Committee to say whether or not we will have Sittings. That is what we are debating at the present time. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that there will be times when it will clash with the House, the solution is for the Committee not to pass a Sittings Motion to put itself in jeopardy, at the mercy of the hon. Gentleman to decide whether he will or will not sit on a particular day when the House is discussing Common Market legislation.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
I have dealt, perhaps at inordinate length, with the European Communities Bill. There is no need to stress to hon. Members the importance of that legislation to the House. I will mention another Bill which will be debated on the Floor of the House immediately after the Easter Recess, at the very time that the hon. Member wants to tie us up here in this Committee room discussing his Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member says he does not want to tie us up. He may want us to go downstairs and discuss the other Bill, as hon. Members on this side would want to do. I think that is an unfortunate remark from the promoter of the Bill. It shows that he does not want his Bill amended; he does not want his Bill debated. He wants it through, and he wants it through as quickly as possible. If hon. Members who oppose the Bill can be got rid of, on the Floor of the House carrying out their constituency duties, the hon. Member is happy.<br><br>
But some of his own hon. Friends are in the same boat as hon. Members on this side of the Committee with regard to the legislation that I am talking about; that is the Local Government Bill. We will reach the Report stage of the Local Government Bill immediately after Easter. There will be five open-ended days on the Floor of the House on the Local Government Bill, debating the boundaries of particular areas, debating the functions of local authorities, all of which are controversial matters and are of vital importance to each individual Member of the House, not only as Members of the House but as constituency Members since the matter concerns their own constituencies.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0198">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 151</span>
A very high proportion of hon. Members on this Committee, particularly among my hon. Friends, served on that Local Government Bill, which had 51 Sittings. I see my hon. Friends the Members for Birmingham, North-field, for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis), for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks) on this side of the Committee. We all served on those 51 Sittings and we have an interest in the Bill. It seems to be our Bill just as much as this is the hon. Member's Bill. We have worked on it and we have had a fair degree of arrangement with the Minister, who has been more than fair on that Bill. He was far more fair than the hon. Gentleman is being with this Committee on a Sittings Motion today.<br><br>
Hon. Gentlemen who have served on that Committee want, and ought, to be present at the Report stage in the House. It is their duty to the House of Commons. They served on the Standing Committee, and they probably know more about the Bill than any other hon. Member. It is their duty to be in their place in the Chamber when that Bill is discussed. They will be in their place in the Chamber when that Bill is discussed. They will be in their place, because hon. Gentlemen on this side of the Committee—and I am certain this is true of hon. Gentlemen opposite—realise that it is their paramount duty to be of service to the House, and not to a Committee. Therefore, they will exercise that duty, particularly on a Bill like the Local Government Bill over which we sweated for so long, which is almost certain to come up some time on a Monday or a Wednesday, as well as the Common Market legislation, and they will be downstairs in the House to discuss it.<br><br>
I have talked so far about hon. Gentlemen on this side of the Committee and their concern with the Local Government Bill, with their constituency interests, their interest as members of the Committee, their duties as members of the House to debate and put forward their points of view, as experienced members of Standing Committee D.<br><br>
Let me turn to hon. Gentlemen opposite, who will be in exactly the same boat if the promoter is successful in getting his Sittings Motion through today. I turn, first, to the Minister for Local Govern-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 152</span>
ment and Development. He has, with the courtesy, consideration, and conscientiousness which we have come to expect of him, attended all three Sittings of this Private Member's Bill, despite the fact that we were meeting in Standing Committee D initially, to consider the Welsh section of the Local Government Bill. But he has come here, and it is important that he should be here, because this is a Bill on which it is important to have a ministerial point of view, and where the Government as a Government should hear the views expressed on all sides of the Committee.<br><br>
But we heard from the Minister, and we hear reports in the Press, that in a way this is little more than a Private Member's Bill. As my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved) pointed out in the Sitting before last, it has considerable Government backing, and, although the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) is moving the Bill, the <i>éminence grise</i> behind it is the Government, who want to get it through. Whether that is true or not, it is vitally important that the Minister should be present at the Committee.<br><br>
The one hon. Gentleman in this Committee who will not be able to be present is the Minister. He knows his duty, which is to pilot his Local Government Bill, a far more important Bill than this, through the Report stage in the Chamber. He is the one hon. Gentleman on whom the promoters of the Bill could not rely to be here. Indeed, it would be his duty not to be here, for when the Local Government Bill is discussed downstairs, it will be his duty to be on the Floor of the House.<br><br>
Therefore, this Committee would be debating the Bill with no Minister present—a disgraceful state of affairs if it were allowed to arise. He cannot send his Under-Secretary or some other member of the Government to the Committee; he is the nominated Government member, and it is either he or no one. He manifestly cannot be here when the House itself will be debating the Local Government Bill, as inevitably it will, on some Mondays and some Wednesdays. The Committee will, therefore, not have the benefit of the advice and guidance of a Minister whom we on this side respect very much, from our experience of him in the House
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0199">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 153</span>
and in Standing Committee D for his fairness, understanding and tremendous knowledge of local government.<br><br>
He is not the only hon. Gentleman sitting behind the promoter of the Bill who will be in great difficulty if the Sittings Motion is passed. Sitting immediately behind the Minister is the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Woodnutt), who supports the Bill. He piloted through a similar Bill in respect of his own island. To deal with the Local Government Bill alone, apart from the Common Market, value added tax and all the other things that we shall discuss downstairs, there is hardly a Member of the House who will be as much concerned to see that various Amendments relating to his own island are debated in the House, affecting the boundaries of the Isle of Wight or whether the Hampshire County Council should be a metropolitan or a non-metropolitan county council.<br><br>
These are matters of vital concern to the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight. He will be put in a position where he must decide, if the Local Government Bill is being debated on the Floor of the House, whether he does his duty by his constituents, or by his hon. Friend the promoter of the Bill. The answer is obvious.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman ought to be fair. I gave a quite specific assurance on the subject of the Local Government Bill in moving the Motion, and I fully accepted the points which he is now making. Therefore, his argument to some extent seems hypothetical.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think so, for this reason. The hon. Gentleman is saying that if the Local Government Bill and the European Communities Bill should take up nearly the whole time of the House between now and Whitsun, he would consider it inconvenient for the Committee not to meet on those days. We are now discussing a Sittings Motion, and I am attempting to show the Committee that it is bound to be highly inconvenient to hon. Gentlemen, and highly inconsistent with their duties as Members of Parliament, if they were tied up in this Committee.<br><br>
I am talking about the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight. On Standing Committee D, as he knows, we dealt with the Isle of Wight and I tried to speak on behalf of his island, because the present
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 154</span>
set-up, as the only island in Britain that will be part of a mainland county council, is wrong. I did my best on that Committee to present the hon. Gentleman's case.<br><br>
I am a Lancashire Member; I come from 300 miles distant from the hon. Gentleman's island. I cannot present a case adequately. The person to present that case, skilfully, adequately, with all the local knowledge at his disposal, is the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight. He owes it to his constituency, to the House of Commons, and to the future of local government not to be here but to be downstairs. If there were a clash, I have no doubt, from my knowledge of the hon. Gentleman, where he would be—on the Floor of the House, debating his constituency. It would be highly inconvenient for him to be up here discussing a Bill which did not really affect the hon. Gentleman's island because he already has those powers in his island.<br><br>
I see, sitting opposite him, the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Maddan). Although we opposed one another frequently on the Local Government Bill, the hon. Gentleman moved some interesting and useful Amendments on that Committee, some of which were accepted, some debated at length—with support from hon. Gentlemen on this side, because it was that sort of Committee—at which the Minister was looking, and some rejected outright. Sometimes we agreed with the hon. Gentleman, sometimes we disagreed; but one thing is certain, that everyone on this side recognised the expertise of the hon. Member for Hove, his ability and his knowledge of local government.<br><br>
I do not doubt that when the Local Government Bill is debated on the Floor of the House, he knows where his duties lie—not only his duty to his constituents but to the Committee and to the House of Commons. That is to be downstairs on Report, not here discussing a Private Member's Bill which he may support but which he would find in conflict with his duties as a Member of the House.<br><br>
I turn to you yourself, Mr. Wallace. The office of Chairman is a very invidious one. A Chairman is one hon. Member of the Committee who has no choice: he has to be here, sitting in that Chair, speechless except when points of order are raised. Again, on the Local Government Bill many Amendments were put
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0200">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 155</span>
down in the name of the Chairman of this Committee.<br><br>
Many of them were accepted; all were useful. He could not discuss them, however, because he was not a member of Standing Committee D. His opportunity to discuss them will come on Report. He is one hon. Gentleman who cannot exercise any choice. He cannot say, "I will go downstairs to the Floor of the House to debate this instead of going up to my Committee". He has to sit here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Cocks</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Gentleman intervenes, I think that, in fairness to the Chairman, who is suffering considerable embarrassment, the hon. Gentleman should not bring him into the argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly did not intend to cause you any embarrasment, Mr. Wallace. I will leave the subject now. I was merely seeking to show the gross inconvenience to all members of the Committee, including yourself, of a Sittings Motion that involves hon. Gentlemen in being upstairs in this Committee when they ought to be downstairs.</span></p>
<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Cocks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. Friend for giving way. In view of the remarks made by the Chairman about the embarrassing and invidious position in which we are placing him, I do not wish to pursue my intervention because what I would have said would have been relevant to what my hon. Friend was saying earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I share my hon. Friend's concern not to embarrass the Chairman, but he will appreciate that the Chairman cannot find an hon. Member to take his place temporarily. It would be difficult to find an hon. Member on this side of the Committee who would accept such an appointment in future, but no doubt the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) would be able to persuade one of his hon. Friends to fill the post.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Chairman was put in that invidious position, however, he could select only an hon. Gentleman who was a member of the Committee, and that brings us back to square one concerning the problem of attendance in the House.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 156</span>
I want to leave that matter and turn to the embarrassment that the promoter of the Bill will be in <i>vis-à-vis</i> his constituents if he finds that the Local Government Bill is being discussed at the same time as this Bill. The hon. Gentleman well knows that there will be Amendments on whether Weston-super-Mare should go into the new county of Avon or stay in Somerset.<br><br>
I have not the slightest idea whether the hon. Member favours Somerset or Avon and it is not the business of the Committee. The hon. Gentleman's constituents, however, will certainly expect him to be on the Floor of the House advancing his views and answering hon. Members who will be talking about the future of his constituency with far less knowledge than he has. Therefore, the promoter of the Bill is, by this Sittings Motion, creating a rod with which he will beat his own back if he finds that the Local Government Bill is being discussed at the same time as this Bill. It must inevitably be some Monday or some Wednesday, or more than one Monday or Wednesday, or perhaps Monday and Wednesday.<br><br>
I have tried to show the Committee the acute difficulties that certain hon. Gentlemen who are members of this Committee will be in because of important legislation going through during this busy Session. Their membership of this Committee will be in conflict with their duties to the constituents and their duties as Members of the House.<br><br>
I have mentioned only two Bills. I have not mentioned the Finance Bill, value added tax and all the other important legislation that will come before the House. I have not mentioned the Housing Finance Bill that will be taken on the Floor of the House and which could affect every hon. Gentleman on both sides of the House. I have not discussed the Sound Broadcasting Bill which for some hon. Members has interests similar to those in this Bill. I have confined my remarks to one Bill. On that one Bill we find ourselves in difficulties.<br><br>
Therefore, the promoter of the Bill should think very carefully about his intentions on a Sittings Motion that will imprison either supporters or opponents of the Bill in this Committee, because they will have the duty of sitting upstairs when they ought to be on the Floor
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0201">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 157</span>
of the House debating highly important legislation that will affect their constituencies for decades, possibly centuries, to come. It is grossly unfair; it is monstrously presumptuous for an hon. Gentleman proposing a private Member's Bill of eight Clauses in five pages to ask the Committee on its fourth Sitting to debate a Sittings Motion.<br><br>
We will meet to discuss the Bill on Wednesday mornings. We will get through the Bill if the hon. Gentleman is patient. We will debate it, line by line. We want to turn it into a good and useful Bill because the promoter has the germ of an idea. There is a lot of chaff around the wheat of that germ and it is our job to get rid of of the chaff, get down to the germ and make a proper Bill of it. We seek to do it, however, at the proper time allotted by the House for private Members' legislation—on Wednesday mornings between 10.30 and 1 o'clock—and at no other time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For reasons which I shah explain, I take a slightly different line from that of my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes). In terms of principle, we should stop now. It is such a wretched Bill, needing so much redrafting, that no more time should be allowed for it.<br><br>
However, if we are going forward, we need rather more time than the Sittings Motion lays down. I would be prepared to come in every morning and every afternoon, and sit through every night if necessary, in order to make this a good Bill. I know that hon. Members opposite are reluctant, as was demonstrated this morning when we could not start the business of the Committee until the sponsor of the Bill had enough of his colleagues present to make a quorum.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there was not one hon. Member from his side in the Committee room?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was because we had withdrawn from the Committee, laying that responsibility fairly and squarely where it belongs—on that side of the Committee. I cannot speak for my colleagues, but I will go outside the room on every possible occasion and make it the sole responsibility of hon. Members opposite to keep the Committee going.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 158</span>
I have already incurred your wrath, Mr. Wallace, because I was infringing the rules of debate in Committee. I was doing so simply because the time of the Committee does not allow us to deploy all our arguments. I suggest, therefore, that if the sponsor of the Bill is serious in his intention to extend the sitting time of the Committee, and if he wants the whole Committee to explore every Amendment and every new point of principle, we should extend far beyond the Sittings Motion that is now before us the scope of the Sitting arrangements for the Committee.<br><br>
I accept everything that my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes has said, but I am sure that he would agree with me, leaving all those difficulties aside, that it will not be possible for us, in the time that is now proposed, to deal adequately with the fundamental age-old liberties that are at stake and lie at the heart of our discussions.<br><br>
On a previous occasion, I was brought to order because I was going outside the rules of order. However, had we had a sufficient number of Amendments down at the time, they could have been drawn in such a way as to permit discussion, including those matters on which you ruled that I was out of order. I would like time to deal more fully with the problem that I was dealing with at the moment when you called me to order and asked me to resume my seat. I should have liked to deal more adequately with the conflict between town and country, but the time that is now proposed will in no way allow us adequately to discuss that issue, which lies at the heart of our discussions.<br><br>
I should have liked to deal also with the problems of urbanisation which, of necessity, impinge upon the problems confronting us when urban dwellers want to go into the countryside to enjoy themselves. In the time proposed, however, we cannot get to grips with these issues. This is another fundamental problem which I should have liked to explore more thoroughly. We cannot expect any response from hon. Members opposite. They are not interested in these large and serious problems. On the contrary, they want to bludgeon the Bill through the Committee, with many of the major and fundamental issues at stake being
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0202">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 159</span>
inadequately discussed. There are many fundamental civil liberties at stake and, what is more, as time passes we shall find that the issues at the centre of the Bill will become much bigger.<br><br>
The Sittings Motion does not allow sufficient time to discuss all the problems that arise out of the conflicting interests between town and country. For example, I should have liked to have spoken at considerable length to an appropriate Amendment about the way in which the country dweller can use the facilities of a town and yet, on an issue such as this, deny the town dweller the right to enjoy country amenities. If we were given sufficient time, all these issues could be, and would be, explored, but as the Motion stands it is not possible to discuss them adequately.<br><br>
The sponsor of the Bill has already suggested that because of the competing interests of other Committees and other business in the House the time that he has proposed may be curtailed. I believe that we should come to some better arangement so that all the issues that he at the heart of the Bill can be properly discussed.<br><br>
The town and country issue is one, I submit—although I see you looking at me in an observant way, Mr. Wallace, and I may, even under a Sittings Motion, be stretching the rules of debate—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member cannot discuss the merits or demerits of the Bill. Otherwise the hon. Member's speech is quite in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was trying, remembering all the guidance that you have given me in the past, Mr. Wallace, to remain strictly within the rules of debate.<br><br>
I was saying that the time that the Sittings Motion now offers us is not sufficient, and in no conceivable way could be imagined to be sufficient, to deal with the fundamental issues which I have outlined so that these issues can be adequately explored and we can produce a Bill—if we need a Bill—that meets all the many objections to it.<br><br>
I know that it is difficult, without Amendments before us, to remain strictly within the rules of debate. But I submit once again that we should explore in this Sittings Motion every objection we have to the time that is proposed. I do not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 160</span>
think we have enough time, and, as I have said, I should be prepared to sit here all night, every night, if necessary in order to deal with the many issues that confront us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not entirely share my hon. Friend's views at the moment that we should sit more frequently than the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) has proposed. If he could convince me that there are matters that he would like to put before the Committee which would lead me to support him in opposing this Motion in order that he might, at some subsequent stage, move another Motion for more Sittings, I should be prepared to listen most attentively to his point. It is legitimate that the Committee should be in full possession of the case which the hon. Member wishes to put forward in support of more Sittings than that proposed by the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. An immediate issue that comes to mind is the fundamental approach to the Bill. Should we give powers to local authorities, or should we insist—as we do in other fields—that the Government is the overriding and central authority? We should have sufficient time to explore adequately those two quite clear and alternative aproaches.<br><br>
I have an Amendment down which I should have hoped the sponsor of the Bill or the Minister would have indicated could be amended in some way to meet their objections and to change the whole philosophy of the Bill. On that one Amendment alone we need rather more time than the sponsor of the Bill has indicated in his Sittings Motion.<br><br>
I have already dealt with the issue of town <i>versus</i> country. There is the whole question, too, of legal definition. I am quite sure that the Committee and the House do not want to pass legislation which, through want of time, is imprecise, in particular with regard to the vexed question of open air. Can we sit long enough in order to decide precisely what open air is? I am sure that the time we have before us will not be sufficient to allow us to produce a satisfactory set of definitions and hence pass adequate legislation.<br><br>
There are many other issues which we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0203">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 161</span>
should discuss at greater length than the time suggested will allow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend moves from the point concerning definition which I know concerns many of my hon. Friends does he agree that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) suggested, all the legal expertise is on this side? Therefore, we feel that it is necessary to call for the presence of the Attorney-General or the Solicitor-General to put a contrary view to the one we might put. In those circumstances, it would be almost impossible to come to any agreement and we would have to adjourn. Perhaps my hon. Friend would deal with that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wallace. Would you advise me whether an hon. Member is still in the Committee when he is talking to people on the dais? Should he not be in his place to be part of the Committee? It seems to me that the hon. Gentleman for Weston-super-Mare might well not be in the Committee at this moment because he is distracting many hon. Members from the business of the Committee by holding private conversations with strangers on the dais.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is within the Committee, and as a Whip the hon. Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved) should know that a Minister sometimes has to confer within the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) is not a Minister; he is merely the Member in charge of the Bill. People sitting on the platform with you, Mr. Wallace, are strangers. Do we take it from your ruling that all members of this Committee are entitled to talk to strangers in this room, both on the dais and in other places in the room?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is so—to take advice. The hon. Gentleman did that very thing only a few moments ago.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Wallace. I spoke to you as the Chairman and to the Committee Clerk who is advising you. So, I did not speak to any stranger—unless the Committee Clerk is a stranger, although I understood him to be an Officer of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 162</span>
House. So I do not think you are absolutely correct in what you have just said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the point but point out that there are representatives of various offices here to give advice. Although they are not members of the Committee, the hon. Gentleman, as a Whip, should know that it is common practice for this to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to have to pursue the point, Mr. Wallace, but I think it is necessary for us to be absolutely certain as to who constitutes a member of the Committee or an Officer of the House. I submit that the parliamentary draftsman and those advising the hon. Member sit there by your courtesy. They are not members of the Committee and are, technically, srangers. Therefore, I suggest that it is inconvenient to the Committee if hon. Members, such as the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare, make a practice, while we are deliberating on these important matters, of engaging in conversations with strangers. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to do that, perhaps he can best do it outside the Committee Room.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite correct in his interpretation of the rules. Strangers can be ordered to withdraw. Once again, I remind him that this is common practice, and the hon. Gentleman in charge of the Bill is technically in the position of a Minister seeking advice. I think the hon. Gentleman is belabouring the point a little too much.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. It might be of interest to the Committee to know that I listened with care to the speech of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter) who raised an important point on which I thought it wise and proper to consult my advisers. I understand that that has long been a custom, and I see no reason why it should change.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was interesting. If my hon. Friend were in charge of this Bill, one can only imagine how speedily it would have moved, had he been in fundamental agreement with all the principles involved. He shows a mastery of all the technicalities of Committee work and has obviously worked for a considerable time on Committees of this kind.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0204">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 163</span>
I go back to what my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) was saying about legal advice. He is a lawyer; I am not. The thing that disturbs me in this Committee is that we have not had sufficient time to deal adequately with the very important points that he has raised. They are not flippant points, and I think it has already been conceded by the sponsor of the Bill that there are difficulties of definition. He indicated, either on the first or the second Sitting, that he recognised that there was a problem with the definition of open air. We have heard nothing more from him since.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not had the chance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have not had the chance, nor the time. If we do have enough time, perhaps, as my hon. Friend for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson) has suggested, we can have the presence of the Attorney-General or the Solicitor-General—I do not know who is the more appropriaete—and get a proper and thorough definition of what constitutes open air—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman will probably appreciate that there is an Amendment down to define this difficult point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) is being fair to the Committee when he says he has not had an opportunity to deal with these points. In fact, he has not tried to rise to catch your eye, Mr. Wallace. If he had done so, I am sure he would have been called.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree. In fact, the sponsor of the Bill at one stage moved the Closure at a point when he could have advised the Committee on his view of the open air question. One hopes that under the revised Sittings Motion the sponsor of the Bill will in future take more opportunity to give the Committee a better idea of what he thinks of important matters.<br><br>
Another issue I would like to have discussed, had we had the time, but as the Sittings Motion stands, I do not think time will be available, is the Isle of Wight Act. One could say that this Bill is the illegitimate offspring of the Isle of Wight Act. I am not sure that there is a great
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 164</span>
deal of legitimacy about the Isle of Wight Act, but I would have liked to discuss it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mark Woodnutt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman explain what he means when he says that he is not certain that there is any legitimacy about the Isle of Wight Act? It is a Measure passed by the House and is on the Statute Book.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I meant that I accept that it is a piece of legislation but I would have liked, had time permitted, to have dealt very thoroughly with the motives behind that Act because I think it is very relevant to our discussions here. I should like to have quoted <i>ad nauseam</i> the many sayings and phrases of the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Woodnutt) because he has said a lot on the subject of pop festivals which is most germane to our discussions here. But the Sittings Motion will not give us sufficient time.<br><br>
All these things are relevant because they add up to the sum total of arguments that have spawned this wretched Bill. One could put down Amendments, but is there any guarantee that they will be called? I doubt it. Time will not permit under the Sittings Motion. So, on this basis alone, we need more time. Vital questions like civil liberties and the conflicts between town and country which I have mentioned are at stake, and we should thoroughly explore all the issues involved.<br><br>
I should like to have explored also precisely what has happened since the Isle of Wight Act came into being. When the Bill becomes an Act, are we sure that all authorities will act in a sensible, reasonable and understanding manner, as the sponsor and the Minister have suggested? We have no guarantee. On the contrary, if the Isle of Wight Act is anything to go by, most country authorities will, I think, react to the Bill in much the same way that they reacted to the Isle of Wight Act. They will act in a most repressive way. I think the Committee should take note of this fact, that within days-<b>Mr. Woodnutt</b>: Does the hon Gentleman understand that since the Isle of Wight Act became operative on 1st December last year there have been no applications for pop festivals and so they have not had the opportunity of acting in that way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I have to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0205">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 165</span>
correct the hon. Member. It is a recorded fact that within 13 days of the Act being passed the Isle of Wight authority applied for an injunction against the promoters of a pop festival concert and the application was granted. It is a sad state of affairs. If time permitted—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Even allowing a quick interjection with time permitting, the hon. Gentleman is out of order. We are not discussing how good or bad the Isle of Wight Act is; we are discussing the Sittings Motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. But all these issues are fundamental to our discussion and we shall not be able, given the time put before us now in the Sittings Motion, adequately to explore the matter.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
As a result of the last interjection, another vital piece of information has come before the Committee which we will not be able to deal with properly but which highlights the frailty of the Bill and the way in which it could affect civil liberties. The hon. Member for the Isle of Wight, who knows the island intimately and the provisions which were incorporated into the unmentionable Act, was unaware, until he was corrected, of the way in which his own local authority had acted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Woodnutt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not true.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will not be possible for us, under the terms of this Sittings Motion, to discuss matters of that kind in which the outside world is very interested.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The intervention of the hon. Member for Me of Wight was relevant and goes to the point of my earlier intervention. We should like the Committee to have the advice of the Attorney-General or the Solicitor-General about how effective applications for injunctions have been, how many people have applied for them and what would be the effect of the application of a common law injunction—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The composition of the Committee or the advice of the Attorney-General or the Solicitor-General has nothing to do with the Sittings Motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. With respect, Mr. Wallace, it has in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 166</span>
sense that if the Committee sits on Monday and Wednesday afternoons, the Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General, who are the only two people who can give proper legal advice, might well be engaged on the Floor of the House and we would be deprived of their advice. If we sit on Monday or Wednesday mornings, they will be much more readily available. To that extent, my intervention was very relevant indeed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the hon. Gentleman says, but the constitution of the Committee is an entirely different matter. We are dealing with the Sittings Motion and whether certain people are present is a different matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think all the points which have arisen in the last few minutes serve to indicate that many of us are in some difficulty about the legal issues involved. I for one should like far more guidance than we have had.<br><br>
The Minister is a solicitor, and no doubt if this was his Bill he would be more forthcoming with definitions. However, to get back to the terms of the Sittings Motion, I submit that, because of the way the Motion is constructed, the time that is proposed would in no way allow us to discuss all the fundamental issues that lie at the heart of the Bill.<br><br>
It is no light matter to tamper with the civil liberties of the majority of the people of this country. I do not think that, under the Sittings Motion, we will be given sufficient time to discuss all these issues.<br><br>
I understand your position as Chairman. Mr. Wallace. Every time I stray outside the rules of debate you, quite rightly, bring me to order, but in doing that you must recognise that many of us would like to spend more time discussing all the serious and basic issues that are at stake.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I understand my hon. Friend's argument correctly, I think he is suggesting that we should sit more frequently than is being suggested, and I take it that when he refers to Law Officers he feels we need more time to deal with Clause 4 of the Bill, which lays down some heavy penal sanctions. I am sure my hon. Friend is aware that under Standing Order 63(1) the Law Officers of the Crown are entitled to attend this Committee, but not to vote.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0206">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 167</span>
If my hon. Friend is arguing that we ought to arrange our Sittings in order to enable the Law Officers to be present—and he is arguing, as I understand it, that they may not be able to come on Wednesday afternoons—this raises a point which I should put to my hon. Friend. Would it not be unwise to agree to this Sittings Motion until we have consulted the Law Officers to find out at what times it would be convenient for them to be here when we get to the matters in Clause 4? However, we need the presence of the Law Officers of the Crown, and we are entitled to have them under Standing Order 63(1).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept what my hon. Friend says. He has far more knowledge of these things than I have. I speak as an individual, and I say that there is a paucity of legal expertise in this Committee, and if we go on much longer without adequate advice we shall get into even bigger difficulties. I accept that on the Opposition side we are well represented. When I referred to a paucity of legal expertise, I was thinking primarily of the Government side. I understand the Minister's position, and I realise that he cannot act as he would act if he were the promoter of the Bill.<br><br>
If we are to debate all the issues involved, we must sit more often and over a greater period of time. The way in which the Bill is going through Committee at present is entirely unsatisfactory. I think you, Mr. Wallace, are in an embarrassing position because we are treated by the Government side in a rather cavalier fashion. They believe that this is a mere tidying-up operation, whereas the Opposition believe that fundamental liberties are at stake. If I sometimes stretch the rules of debate, it is simply because the Opposition are fighting this Measure tooth and nail.<br><br>
I should have thought that sufficient time could be made available by the Government to allow us to deal with all the issues involved in a sensible and more civilised way. My view, which has been confirmed this morning, is that there is not enough time.<br><br>
There was a very short opening statement by the sponsor of the Bill in introducing this Sittings Motion which went nowhere near far enough to explain why three Sittings in one week are enough.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 168</span>
It would be over-generous to say that he was on his feet for five minutes to deal with a Bill which I put on a par with the Industrial Relations Bill for importance. We may be in a small Committee room, well away from the Chamber, but the issues—[<i>Laughter.</i>] Hon. Members opposite laugh, but the Opposition attach more importance to the Bill and approach it in a more serious way.<br><br>
I understand that the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Woodnutt) does not view the question of civil liberties quite as we do, but I should have thought that, taken in the context of the rights of the individual, this was something to which hon. Members opposite should be prepared to devote rather more time and effort. We see the Bill as a serious incursion into civil liberties, and it should not be an occasion for jollity upon the part of hon. Members opposite.<br><br>
Other issues arise out of previous discussions on other legislation. I refer in particular to the question of health and hygiene regulations. We have not reached the subject yet, since it is dealt with in Clause 2, but as the Sittings Motion stands. I doubt whether we shall be given sufficient time. A salient fact is that there is tremendous disagreement amongst eminent medical authorities as to the kind of regulation which is wanted and, indeed, as to whether there is any need for regulations. Much controversy arose from the last pop concert on the Isle of Wight. Had time permitted. I should have liked to deal more fully with the conflicting reports and comments that emerged on that occasion. Would I be stretching the rules of order too far if I gave one brief quotation. Mr. Wallace?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In order to save the hon. Gentleman much hard work and preparation, the answer is, no. I am afraid that he would not be in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not press you on that. Mr. Wallace. As you can see, I have a whole succession of quotations and, had the first one been allowed, many others would have followed in its train. I regret the decision because it will not now be possible for me to deploy many arguments which I should have liked to use to reinforce my basic position—namely. that the Sittings Motion as it stands in no way gives the Committee sufficient
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0207">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 169</span>
time to discuss the many and fundamental issues at the centre of the Bill.<br><br>
For example, I should have liked to deal with the experience of Members of Parliament and to describe more fully a pop concert held in the constituency of Newcastle-under-Lyme, but, as the Sittings Motion stands, I shall have no opportunity to do so. I might add in passing, however, that my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mr. Golding) lives opposite the site of the concert and was greatly opposed to it before it took place. He tried to induce the authorities to ban it, but it was held and afterwards he admitted that all his fears had been quite unfounded. As the Sittings Motion stands, however, I shall not be able to deal adequately with the issues which arose out of his experiences. I suppose that I could put down an Amendment and, even under the limited time now proposed, I might find that it had been selected, giving me an opportunity to discuss the experience of the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme.<br><br>
I should also, under an extended Sittings Motion, have liked to discuss the kind of regulation needed, should it be agreed that a code of conduct is necessary. However, I do not think that we shall have sufficient time as the Sittings Motion stands. While on the subject, I remind the Committee that it has very little experience to draw upon in order adequately to determine precisely what regulations are necessary. Under the building regulations there is a great mass of information and requirements, some of which the Committee would accept and a large part of which it would reject. I think in particular of hygiene standards as they apply to stadiums; we could deal at length with those, had we sufficient time. Anyone who attends football matches will know that toilet facilities may be quite sufficient at one stadium and insufficient at another. What standard should we adopt as a good guide for the Committee? I do not know, nor, I am sure, do many people concerned with health. However, I am sure that in order to have the necessary background of information, we should need far more time to deal with the regulations which could form part of the code of conduct which may be introduced by the Minister.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
I should also have liked to deal with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 170</span>
the question of crowd control. Various figures have been put before us and no one has so far been able to persuade every member of the Committee to accept a standard figure for crowd numbers for insertion in the Bill. Some proposed 3,000, some 10,000, some 15,000, and my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved) went as high as 50,000. Shall we be given sufficient time, as the Sittings Motion stands, adequately to get to grips with that point? Very little information is available and, as far as legal definitions are concerned, the Committee should perhaps ask for more expert advice before it embarks upon the setting of standards for crowd control. Again, there will not be sufficient time.<br><br>
No doubt, the Minister, with the expert advice at his disposal, will give us some guidance as to what the figures should be. He has indicated that they should be flexible and that the regulations should be geared to the numbers attending different types of event. I agree, but shall we be given enough time to deal with the question? I very much doubt it. That is a further reason why I think the Sittings Motion is inadequate.<br><br>
As I said, I should have preferred the sponsor of the Bill either to withdraw it as being inadequate or to allow the work of the Committee to be carried on in a way which measures up to the fundamental issues at stake. He has opted for neither alternative. The wretched Bill remains, and there is a limited amount of time in which to discuss all those issues.<br><br>
I could go on at length about the question of liberty which is at stake and which I believe to be gravely threatened by the Bill. The way in which the Bill has been dealt with so far and the way in which the hon. Gentleman has brought forward his Motion show clearly and unequivocally that our thoughts are in no way shared by hon. Members opposite. I am not suggesting for a moment that they do not care about freedom and liberty; of course, they do. But, if they do, not much comment has come from them on that issue so far in our deliberations.<br><br>
I would have hoped that the sponsor of the Bill would get to his feet soon, having heard what we have said so far this morning clearly indicates that his Sittings
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0208">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 171</span>
Motion is inadequate in providing sufficient time and in measuring up to the serious attack that the Bill poses to civil liberties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find myself in considerable sympathy with the argument put forward by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter) in pleading for further time for the discussion of the Bill. Indeed, that is the very Motion before the Committee now—a Sittings Motion providing for further time for the Bill. I remind the hon. Gentleman that, if he and his colleagues had accepted the Sittings Motion without debate, we should now have had one hour and 22 minutes' further discussion of the Bill itself.<br><br>
It is always very difficult when one finds that a Private Member's Bill requires long debates—</span></p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN'S <i>attention having been called to the fact that six Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the Room, and six Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having seen what was happening in the childish procedure of the Opposition in withdrawing so that there would not be a quorum—that I was to be subjected to that rather foolish procedure, having been requested earlier in the day that a Minister should attend these proceedings—I think the conduct of the Opposition in doing that is simply disgraceful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have to be here all night.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will be here all night, as the hon. Gentleman says, because I think that value can be obtained from the Bill.<br><br>
I was saying that it is always a difficult problem when we find that a Private Member's Bill requires long debates and thorough discussion. On the accepted procedure of the House, Private Member's Bills are referred to one Committee, and the result is that only one such Bill is dealt with at any one time. If we want long debates on this Bill—as I think we do—and we have those debates only once a week, we are holding up selfishly other Private Members' Bills queueing up behind this one.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 172</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware, with his long experience in the House, that it is within the power of the Government to see that Private Member's Bills are allocated to other Standing Committees, and it is a fact that a number of Standing Committees will shortly be falling vacant. It is not a true allegation that we are holding up Private Member's Bills; they can be allocated to other Committees.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It remains that there is no such allocation at present. We are dealing with the business as it stands. It is only fair that we should so arrange our business on the Committee that we are not unfair to the promoters of other Private Member's Bills and, indeed, to the House itself. The House needs Bills to come back from Committee, whether they are public or Private Member's Bills.<br><br>
We ought to sit, I think, for the extra Sittings suggested by the Motion, so as to complete our debates on the Bill as soon as possible and allow the other Bills to find their place in Committee, which are now queueing up behind this one, and unfairly being kept out of Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: By the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Committee is in agreement, at least, on the principle behind the Bill—at least, that is how I interpret speakers on both sides—that it is essential for pop festivals, however one defines them, that proper standards should be worked out for choosing the sites and organising the festivals. It is the details of that for which we need time for debate on the Committee. We need thoroughly to consider a system of controls which achieve the standards necessary for safety and health while keeping expenses to a minimum.<br><br>
We want the time to discuss the experience already gained by several local authorities in contact with pop festivals—experience of catering for an enormous temporary population. They have evolved some standards which we ought to debate. I do not think that we shall have sufficient time to debate them if our meetings are only once a week, without disorganising the whole procedure for Private Members' Bills.<br><br>
It is necessary for central Government to give some guidance on this system of control, and I hope that, with the assistance of the advisers who I am fortunate
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0209">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 173</span>
enough to have in the Department, I shall be able to help the Committee on that. The Committee should consider that sort of guidance on the standards to be established.<br><br>
I do not say that the guidance should come in a statutory form, that we should necessarily introduce it into the terms of the Bill, or that we have to discuss complicated Amendments of it. The variety of circumstances and the early stage of experience of festivals require a flexibility in laying down standards of that sort. But the standards should be laid down, and the Committee will recollect that on the last occasion of its meeting I referred to a working party's report which included some advice on pop festivals.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will consider that report in some detail. On consideration, after the last Sitting, I came to the conclusion that the Committee should be informed of the report's contents, so far as it deals with pop festivals in one chapter and one appendix of the report. I propose today to make that extract from it available to the Committee.<br><br>
I think this is a matter of some importance when we are considering the Sittings Motion which is before the Committee now. The Committee should have time to consider the report without inconveniencing other legislation in the House.<br><br>
The working party recommends a code, and I certainly accept that pop festivals should be governed by a code to minimise the risks to public health and safety. The Government accepted the main recommendations on pop festivals of that working party, which was under the chairmanship of Mr. Dennis Stevenson. The working party Report entitled "The Role of Voluntary Organisations and Youth in the Environment". Unless we have some further Sittings of the Committee it may be a long time before we are able to return the Bill for consideration by the House.<br><br>
The working party to which I referred was appointed by the Secretary of State for the Environment and it has recommended an independent, national body of unpaid advisers to gather full information on the problems involved.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. May I seek your guidance, Mr. Wallace?
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 174</span>
The Minister is introducing some matters of fundamental importance for the consideration of the Committee. I seek your advice on this point. I have no objection if the Minister is in order in doing so. But if such fundamental matters are being introduced on a Sittings Motion, by such a prominent spokesman as the Government Minister, I seek your advice on whether we will be allowed during the course of this Sittings Motion to debate them adequately. It would be unfortunate if the Minister were able to put forward these fundamental points and they were not able to be properly debated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite correct. I accept that the Minister was introducing issues which were not strictly related to the Sittings Motion and I have no doubt he will take note of the Chair's view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that point of order, I was prosing to make available to the Committee a document which will need some study by hon. Members. I wanted to inform the Committee very briefly of the contents of that document so that it might possibly be considered before the next Sitting of the Committee. I do not propose to debate that document in any way, but I think it would be of assistance to the Committee to know, in connection with the Sittings Motion, whether this will take them a long time to study or whether they have to argue this document against the promoter of the Bill or against the Government's intentions. I hoped that by a few sentences I might indicate to them briefly what they would have to study and how long it might take them to do this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. If the Minister is going to introduce any detailed statement as to this working party report, I ask you to consider whether you will allow us to reply during the course of this Sittings Motion to matters that he introduces. I think you would agree that, in fairness to the Committee, it would be unfortunate if the Minister introduced such fundamental matters, which go very wide of the matter now before us. While we are most anxious to hear the Minister, it may be better that he should make his statement when it can be properly debated, if it is your decision that we cannot debate it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0210">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 175</span>
on this Motion this morning. I assume, because of the time, that it will be carried over until another Sitting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I took the view that the Minister was giving the Committee advance information to its advantage. Quite clearly, we cannot discuss these matters now. We must deal with the Sittings Motion. I was allowing this in the interests of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Wallace. We are reluctant to stop the Minister. We are most anxious to hear what he has to say. But it would be unfortunate if, on such a fundamental matter, the Minister just breezed into the Committee, blew it all out and then pushed off, and we were not able to challenge immediately any matters which he put to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think the hon. Gentleman could accuse me of breezing into the Committee and rushing out again. I have listened patiently to all the arguments this morning.<br><br>
What I wanted to tell the Committee was briefly the sort of things they would have to consider in this report, so that they might judge the length of time that is needed for further debate. I quite appreciate that I am introducing something new in the Bill. I want to say that this report—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I am sorry to keep interrupting the Minister. The Minister is now about to quote from an official document which refers to a report presented to the Secretary of State for the Environment. I believe we will find under Standing Orders that if a Minister refers to an official document that document should be available to the Committee, and I would ask that that be so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should have listened to what I said. I said I would make this available to the Committee. Immediately I sit down it will be on that table for the Committee to see.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I am sorry about this, Mr. Wallace, but I submit to you in all seriousness that this is highly irregular. If a Minister is going to refer to or quote from an official document, that document should
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 176</span>
be available to the Committee. I ask that you so rule in accordance with the Standing Orders.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not referred in detail to the document. He was just giving advance information. He gave the information to the Committee that he would make certain sections available to it at a later stage. We are not discussing what the Minister has introduced by way of information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The information, as the hon. Gentleman will find when he reads this report, is that the working party recommends the setting up of a national body of unpaid advisers to gather full information on the problems created by pop festivals, to work out suitable controls and to employ paid advisers who would work with the local authorities and the promoters in each case.<br><br>
This is the sort of thing which I hope the Committee will have an opportunity to discuss fully, and it will not have that opportunity if we only sit on Wednesday mornings for several weeks ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Really!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. It is all very well the hon. Gentleman saying "Really!", but am I not entitled to ask why this Sittings Motion has been introduced today when the sponsor of the Bill and the Minister knew full well that they were going to introduce an entirely new ground for discussion? If this document has been available, why has it not been available earlier to the Committee, and why—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Wallace.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot go further to a point of order which is not a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a new point of order. I was continually rebuked by you for referring to the need for extra time in order to discuss precisely the issues which the Minister now tells us it will be possible for us to discuss, given your consent, after the passing of this Motion. It seems to me, without wishing to offend the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0211">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 177</span>
Minister in any way, that you have been somewhat partial as a Chairman in allowing the Minister to proceed along lines far more general than mine. Yet I was continually asked by you to come back to order.<br><br>
I submit that there has been a differential in terms of treatment, and I ask you, when the Motion is passed, as I am sure it will be when the Government side have mustered all their numbers, whether you will not object to my coming back on a second occasion and re-introducing in a more flexible and deeper way the issues that I attempted to deal with before the Minister suggested earlier that it would be possible for us to come back to these.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Wallace. I think you will find when you read the speech of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter) in the OFFICIAL REPORT that he dealt to a considerable extent with the necessity for a code, which was just what I was coming to. so that the Committee might know what it had to consider at future Sittings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman in his point of order suggested the Chair had been partial, but in fact the hon. Gentleman has been given a great deal of leniency in enlarging on points which were, strictly speaking, out of order. The attitude of the Chair to a Private Member's Bill is to be as lenient as possible within the bounds of order because it is the Chair's responsibility to be so. The hon. Gentleman is quite correct in saying that the Chair was being partial. The Minister was introducing information that would be available, and was not dealing with it in debate. I ask the Committee now to proceed with the Sittings Motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wallace. Could you give a ruling to this effect which. I am sure, would be of assistance to the Committee? If the Minister is now introducing a document which is to be circulated to the Committee and, on the basis of the information in that document, he is arguing that we should have more time to debate that and other points in the Bill, would it not be right to give an assurance that you will give an extra day to this Committee to allow it to debate a timetable Motion?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 178</span>
Unless we know what is in that document, we cannot possibly today debate whether we need extra time. Can we not have an assurance now that whatever the result of today's deliberations, we shall have an extra day to debate it on the basis of the information contained in that document which we have not yet seen?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is nothing to do with the Sittings Motion. If the document is subsequently laid, the Committee then may have an opportunity, but that is entirely dependent upon the way the matter is introduced. We are discussing a Sittings Motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I could go back to my point before the Minister resumes. I did not wish to offend either the Minister or yourself Mr. Wallace; I merely thought that you were judging the Minister's new point of a code of practice in a rather different way from the way in which you judged mine.<br><br>
I asked you, in view of this new information which will profoundly change our future discussions, whether you would not rule me out of order if I were to repeat at the next Sitting many of the arguments that I tried to adduce this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is being quite hypothetical on this issue. He introduced various matters at an early stage which required further debate; the Minister is doing exactly the same in referring to a document. Consequently, I should ask the Committee to proceed strictly with the Sittings Motion. The question of time on other issues is entirely a matter for the Committee and the Chair later. The Minister has introduced various matters and the hon. Member has introduced various matters, into which we shall go in detail at a later stage, but not on a Sittings Motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a fresh point of order. On 21st February, 1966, Mr. Speaker said in the House that it was the responsibility of the Department and the Department in the matter which I am now going to put to you is the Department of the Environment under the Minister who is now addressing the Committee—to lay before the House, by placing in the Library, any relevant documents, statutes, Regulations or papers that appear to be relevant to the Com-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0212">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 179</span>
mittee's consideration.<br><br>
My submission to you is that the Minister, in introducing on the Sittings Motion a fundamental matter involving a report which at the moment is known only to the Secretary of State for the Environment and those under his control in the Department, is doing something which Mr. Speaker on 21st February, 1966, sought to avoid by his ruling.<br><br>
I ask you, Mr. Wallace, to consider very carefully where we shall end up if this procedure, which the Minister is now attempting to interject into the Committee's proceedings, is successful. First of all, we shall be violating Mr. Speaker's ruling of 21st February, 1966.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a point of order and has nothing whatever to do with the Sittings Motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a further point of order. You will be aware, Mr. Wallace, that under the Standing Orders there is such a thing as the Chairmen's Panel. It is one of the duties of a member of that Panel—and you are such a member—from time to time to take points to the Chairman's Panel for the consideration so that the Panel can deliberate and make a recommendation to Mr. Speaker, who, in turn, will make a ruling to the House of Commons.<br><br>
In respect of the matters which now are before the Committee in the light of the Minister's action and your ruling, I should submit that, under the Standing Orders and under your powers as a member of the Chairmen's Panel, you should take this matter to the Panel, ask them to consider it and to make a recommendation to Mr. Speaker.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
I make that representation to you, Mr. Wallace, because the Chairmen's Panel is the body which is responsible for giving detailed consideration to the procedures in Standing Committee. I submit to you that the procedure which has now been adopted is, first of all, contrary to the regulations and the Standing Orders, which is a matter for you. Secondly, it is a grossly unfair procedure to other members because we arc at the moment discussing a Sittings Motion.<br><br>
As I understand the usual procedure in Standing Committee, it is not normal to allow a Sittings Motion to spread over
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 180</span>
more than one Sitting. Therefore, I assume that if the Minister's reprehensible conduct is allowed and the normal procedure is adopted, and the Sittings Motion is put at the conclusion of this morning's debate, we shall be in the unfortunate position that the Minister, by a stretch of the rules, will have introduced a fundamental document into our debate which we have been denied the opportunity of discussing adequately.<br><br>
In addition to asking you to place before your fellow Chairmen on the Chairmen's Panel the points that I have put, I should also ask you, in the remaining three-quarters of an hour of this Committee, to consider seriously whether it would be right at this morning's Sitting, in view of the Minister's action, to come to a conclusion on the Sittings Motion which is now before us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has a Motion before it and must get on with it. With regard to the other remarks made by the hon. Gentleman, in due course I shall very carefully study the proceedings of this Committee—probably under quieter circumstances—and after due consideration I shall use my discretion as to whether I should place those matters, or any other related matter, before the Chairmen's Panel.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So that we can be absolutely certain on the record, I, and my hon. Friends, are in no way casting a reflection upon your goodself in the Chair. We have the greatest respect and desire to abide by all your rulings. The points we are making were not intended, and should not be taken, as any reflection on yourself. They are intended to be a reflection upon the disgraceful conduct of the Minister for introducing, in an abuse, this new material.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order which follows from the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Cray-ford (Mr. Wellbeloved). He suggested—and you did not pass judgment on his remarks in this respect—that a vote on this Sittings Motion would be taken at the end of the Sitting. I understood from the Minister's remarks that he hoped that, within the context of this debate on the Sittings Motion, we could examine the document that he was going to make available.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0213">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 181</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister had better repeat himself because I am sure that most hon. Members of the Opposition had that impression. Perhaps you, Mr. Wallace, could confirm whether you had that same impression.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is raising a purely hypothetical point. He is not raising a point of order. We have not reached a decision as to whether there will be a vote on the Sittings Motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. The Opposition are in great difficulty. I do not claim to have the expertise in procedure which you have, Mr. Wallace, or which my hon. Friend has. I ask, in a genuine and sincere way, whether it is not possible at this stage for us to have sight of the document. Is it possible for the Committee to adjourn, to consider it, and come back next week and continue to debate the Sittings Motion, based on the information that we have gleaned? It is a reasonable request which I put sincerely. Otherwise, the whole argument about the Sittings Motion seems irrelevant and hypothetical. If the Minister now says that there is vital information in this document which needs to be discussed, and nobody on this side of the Committee has seen the document, how can we seriously discuss how long we should sit and how much deliberation we need in order to come to a conclusion?<br><br>
If the Minister has the document with him and presents every member of the Committee with a copy, we can consider at our leisure the importance of the points in that document, and have a full debate after Easter as to how many Sittings will be necessary to consider those and other points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The merits of the document, if they are relevant to the Bill, can be considered in future discussions on the Bill. They are not relevant and cannot be discussed on a Sittings Motion. I hope that the Committee will now proceed to the Sitting Motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. It might have been considered a reflection on you, Mr. Wallace, when my hon. Friend referred to expertise among some members of the Committee. The expertise
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 182</span>
of both yourself and other members of the Committee depends entirely on the customs and practice of the House together with the Standing Orders. The only expert on that is Erskine May, the journal edited by the learned Clerk of the House with the aid of those who advise him. I raise that matter merely in order that the record shall show that no reflection on you is intended by my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. If I may add what might be termed fatherly advice, to assume expertise on the part of any person is a dangerous proceeding.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. In introducing this point, I claimed to have very little expertise in the matter. By introducing it, I have proved that I do not have expertise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Whether the hon. Gentleman has expertise is not a point of order. I must ask him to resume his seat.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I continue with the point of order which I did raise? I should certainly not wish to cast any aspersions on the Chair by comparing the expertise of my hon. Friend with that of the Chair. If I did that, I would certainly withdraw it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman would now drop his point of order, he would assist the Chair greatly by resuming his seat and carrying on with the debate on the Sittings Motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Strictly on a point of information, Mr. Wallace, might the Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved) give us some information which was not rebutted by you—that a Sittings Motion must be carried during the Sitting in which it was introduced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Normally.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Normally. Can we be assured that that practice will not be adhered to this morning? I submit that we cannot. In all conscience, hon. Members opposite cannot vote on the Sittings Motion unless the whole Committee has had sufficient time to study the document. It would be a simple matter, and easily disposed of, if the sponsor of the Bill would indicate that he has no in-

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 183</span>
tention of pushing the vote, as it were, in this Sitting. If we can be given that assurance, we shall have sufficient time during the Easter Recess to study the document and to come back fully armed with that information, in a position to judge whether the Sittings Motion is adequate.<br><br>
Without that assurance and without the intervening period, I, for one, am certainly not in a position to say whether the time proposed in the Sittings Motion is adequate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can make no such promises. The document is not before the Committee and we must proceed with the Sittings Motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The disgraceful and reprehensible conduct to which the hon. Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved) referred is not that of the Minister but of the hon. Member who was endeavouring to persuade you to gag the Minister who comes here for the information of the Committee—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. The Minister is wrong to suggest that we are attempting to gag him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Chair will rule whether there is a point of order, and I am sure that it will rule only when it has heard the point and can make a decision on it. I put to you, Mr. Wallace, that it is the duty of the Chair, which you carry out with great diligence and understanding, to protect hon. Members from such unfounded allegations as those which the Minister has made—that anyone is attempting to gag him. It is the Minister, by refusing to conform to normal practice, by abusing procedure in not laying the document, who is trying to gag the Committee. We are not trying to gag the Minister. I hope that you will protect us from such unfounded allegations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What I could have done was to sit quietly while the Sittings Motion was being debated and to say that the document had nothing to do with it. I could have then silently put it in the Library, which I intended to do after this morning's Sitting. I could have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 184</span>
put it there without informing the Committee of any of its contents. I suppose that this is what the hon. Gentleman would wish me to do.<br><br>
If I am not permitted to say what I wanted to say about this document in order to give information to the Committee, I shall have to say it elsewhere. It would be far better and more courteous to you and to the Committee, Mr. Wallace, if I said briefly what is in the document, then laid it before the Committee and put copies in the Library.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister will not go into detail. It would be better to proceed purely with the Sittings Motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To this extent I ask you to allow me to go into detail. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter) argued strongly that the Committee should have further time to debate certain matters and in particular a code of practice, whether laid down centrally or, as he said, by the Secretary of State. He said that the time proposed in the Sittings Motion was inadequate for discussion of that kind of thing.<br><br>
I have had codes presented to me for discussion by the Committee. The National Committee of the Young Conservatives have taken the initiative in providing a carefully thought out code which they feel should be discussed by the Committee. I have sympathy with them. I do not believe that such a code should be laid down in any sort of mandatory form or that the Committee will need to discuss Amendments obliging the Secretary of State to lay down that code, either in the Bill or by Order under the Bill. I want to hear the Committee's views on this. The proposal in that report which I will lay before the Committee, the Stevenson Report, is that an independent national body of advisers should keep a flexible code in operation. That has its attractions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very reluctant to interrupt on a point of order. This is becoming serious and I should like to remind the Committee what the Minister said at our last Sitting in respect of this particular Report in Column 122. You were not in the Chair, Mr. Wallace: my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks) had tern-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0215">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 185</span>
porarily taken the Chair. The Minster said this:
<br><blockquote><p>"I have been asked to comment on the working party on the role of voluntary organisations and youth in the environment. My Secretary of State has received its report, which, like all reports from working parties set up by the Department is receiving full and careful study. The report will be published at the end of April, and it will be appreciated that I cannot at this stage inform the Committee in detail of its contents."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee C</i>, 22nd March, 1972; <i>c.</i> 122.]</p></blockquote>
So just one week ago, the Minister told the Committee that this report would be published at the end of April.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman come to his point of order?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, I will do so. The Minister's view a week ago was that he could not tell us about the report. The Minister has failed to conform—and this is the point of order—to Mr. Speaker's ruling of 21st January, 1966—which is available to you, Mr. Wallace, and to your advisers—that relevant papers should be placed in the Library. I search the Library file on this Committee each morning before the Committee sits. There is no reference to this. I believe it is an abuse of procedure for the Minister flagrantly to violate Mr. Speaker's ruling. I would ask you, Mr. Wallace, to obtain a copy of Mr. Speaker's ruling before the Minister proceeds. We are now in an impossible position, and the Minister is abusing this Committee and violating the rules.</span></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That was not a point of order. I have already ruled on that matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not a legitimate point of order to ask you, Mr. Wallace—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Chair will rule, not the hon. Gentleman. He may try to thrash young children and stop them enjoying themselves, but he will not obstruct the rights of this Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Withdraw that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not. Mr. Wallace, is it not a fact—I submit it is, and the information is available to you—that on 21st February, 1966, a ruling was
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 186</span>
given by Mr. Speaker that it was the responsibility of the Department concerned to lay in the Library in advance of the Committee stage a list of all papers relevant to the proceedings. The document to which the Minister is referring, namely, the Stevenson working party report, is such a document. We were told a week ago that it was not available. It should be available in the Library now, not at a later stage. The Minister is abusing his position, and I ask you, Mr. Wallace, to protect us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman in his rather lengthy point of order, has made a number of points, one of which I have already ruled on. Criticism of the conduct of the Minister is not a matter for me. The hon. Gentleman must take his points elsewhere if he so desires.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Is it in order for the hon. Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved) to accuse me of thrashing young children? It was said out of the blue, and there was no possible reason for such a ridiculous accusation. Will he withdraw that statement?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. Extravagant language is not a matter to be raised on a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I apologise for putting these points of order, but I know that you, Mr. Wallace, are endeavouring to do what is right for the Committee and the House. You said just now that the conduct of the Minister was not a matter for the Chair. With all due respect, I would say that the conduct of every member of this Committee, whether he be a Minister or a back bencher as humble as myself, is a matter for the Chair because you are the custodian, by virtue of the powers conferred upon you by the Standing Orders of the House in a Standing Committee. Therefore, the conduct of the Minister, or of any other Member, is a matter for you, and I hope that you will reconsider that ruling.<br><br>
Certainly criticism of the Minister is not a matter for the Chair, but the conduct of the Minister in not conforming to Mr. Speaker's ruling is, in my submission, quite clearly a matter for the Chair. The Chairman of a Standing Committee is appointed with the powers and the res-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0216">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 187</span>
ponsibilities of ensuring that the practices of the House are upheld in the Committee. The practice is not being upheld because the Minister and his Department have failed to lay the relevant documents in the Library as they are required to do by Mr. Speaker's statement of 21st February, 1966. Therefore, the Minister's conduct is, I submit, a matter for the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The short answer to the hon. Gentleman is that the Chair has no powers to compel a Minister to lay papers before the Committee. This is not a matter for the Chair and it is not a point of order. When I was referring to the conduct of the Minister, it was the conduct the hon. Gentleman had in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. If the conduct of the Minister in violating the statement and ruling of Mr. Speaker is not a matter for the Chair, what would be the appropriate way in which I can raise this matter? I have asked you to use your powers as a member of the Chairmen's Panel. I assume from your ruling that you will give consideration to that point at a later stage and in calmer circumstances, and I appreciate the necessity of so doing. But if it is not in the immediate circumstances of a violation of a statement by Mr. Speaker, which is what we are now witnessing, and that is not a matter for the Chair, perhaps you would tell us how we could deal with this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The matter can be taken up in the House. It is not a matter for the Committee. The hon. Gentleman will know of ways and means whereby that can be done in the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said earlier that I thought it right that the Committee should know the contents of one chapter of the report, namely, the chapter on pop festivals. That chapter of the report will be available to hon. Members this morning and I hope that they will appreciate from it the necessity for this Committee to spend further time in debate than it would spend if we stuck to the present procedure of sitting only on Wednesday mornings.<br><br>
We want to consider the need for a code of this sort. As the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter) said, we want to consider the idea of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 188</span>
communication between the various parties on the basis of evolving rules of the game for the experience which has been gained by local authorities. I am not convinced that we need a paid body to do that, as was recommended in the report, but I think a constructive way of doing that is by a national advisory body, which I hope the Committee will have a chance to discuss if we give the Committee time enough to do so.<br><br>
Possibly from such debates we shall come to the conclusion that a code of this nature will be a useful adjunct to this Bill. Not, as I say, that we shall have to discuss Amendments which may introduce it into the Bill, but to see whether we can have a body that will keep a code flexible and updated with the experience that is gained. Against the background of such a code, and taking local conditions into account, promoters and local authorities should be able to work out acceptable arrangements.<br><br>
This is the sort of thing which I think will take some time to debate in this Committee. Indeed, we shall come later to consider the form of appeal from the decisions of local authorities, and I think such a code would serve as a guide to appeal before the person appointed by the Secretary of State to hear those appeals.<br><br>
I want, with the Committee, to have time to work out in practical form this idea of improving communication between all concerned; those who organise pop festivals, those who regulate them, those who enjoy them and, indeed, those who do not enjoy them, and to find some form for getting them together. The exact form of organisation and the mode of help to be given by the Department of the Environment call for further thought and further assistance from this Committee.<br><br>
I do not think that we can extend our debates week after week by sitting for only 2½ hours on one day a week. It is absolutely necessary that the Bill should be fully discussed and that we should have the extra sessions in which to discuss it. We shall be in difficulties with the matter which is on the Floor of the House, but I think that the Monday afternoons, which my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) has proposed in his Sittings Motion will not clash with anything of vital importance in the House. If it does, then of course
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0217">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 189</span>
the Committee is at liberty to adjourn so that hon. Members may attend that; or there are the usual ways of arranging, on either side of a Committee, for Members to be off in pairs to attend debates on the Floor of the House. So I do not think it will inconvenience the Committee if we adopt the Sittings Motion proposed by my hon. Friend.<br><br>
Having got to the stage where I wish to sit down and hon. Members will not be turning over the pages of the report while I am speaking and not attending to what I am saying, I can now place on the table copies of extracts from that report. I can assure the hon. Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved) that this will be in the library.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin Maddan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No doubt hon. Members will not be listening to my remarks, Mr. Wallace, but will be looking at the report. I have no objection to that whatsoever. They can take their choice. But I want to address myself strictly to this Sittings Motion and I hope I shall be allowed to do so without points of order being raised. I shall do everything I can to remain within the centre of order.<br><br>
I support this Sittings Motion because I believe that the Bill is important. I think all hon. Members agree with that, whether they like the Bill or not. The Bill has had a Second Reading. In private Members' Bill practice, as is well known, proceedings are often somewhat protracted by those who do not like the principle of the Bill. I suppose that the history of our proceedings in the House provides many excellent precedents for proceedings on a private Member's Bill being protracted when the Bill is of a fundamentally controversial nature. But it cannot be said that this Bill is fundamentally controversial because, if it was, it would undoubtedly have been opposed on Second Reading.<br><br>
Therefore, the House as a whole decided it wanted a Bill such as this. I concede at once that hon. Members may have had in mind the need for Amendments, even substantial Amendments, but they knew the Bill was directed at a real problem concerning those attending pop festivals or other night assemblies, local authorities and their responsibilities, or the locality where night assemblies take place.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 190</span>
Hon. Gentlemen are entitled to amend the Bill as much as they wish, but we are not against the Bill in principle. The proceedings of this Committee, of which this is the fourth Sitting spread over a month, demonstrate beyond doubt the complicated nature of argumentation in favour of or against the Bill. If it had not been so complicated, there would not have been such long speeches from hon. Members. I think it would, in passing, be relevant to suggest that hon. Members opposite find these matters more complicated than we do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: True enough.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maddan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter) and I agree on the need for ample time for discussion, and I think the whole Committee agrees that the Bill, having had an unopposed Second Reading, is a Bill which in principle we want to get on the Statute Book, though, no doubt, subject to alteration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When a Bill has a Second Reading, that does not presuppose that everybody agrees it should go speedily through Committee without the closest examination. It simply means that we agree that there is a basic principle which we do not wish to oppose. But if the principle is not made clear on Second Reading, it needs the closest examination to see that the desire for a code of practice does not become an attack, as it has, on civil liberties.</span></p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maddan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that what the hon. Gentleman has said gives every reason for supporting this Sittings Motion, unless we have an alternative Sittings Motion of the sort that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield suggested, with perhaps even further Sittings. But we have to compromise between the desirable and the practical. As the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) says, we have other business to do in the Chamber and on behalf of our constituents.<br><br>
What my hon. Friend has put forward seems to me just about right for the convenience of hon. Members, having regard to our other commitments and responsibilities, and having regard to the fact that the Bill is clearly wanted in general terms, though, no doubt, subject to amendment. What has been proposed this morning is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0218">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 191</span>
none too soon, because we have to take into account the parliamentary timetable. If a Bill does not go through all its stages in the House of Commons and in another place by a certain time, it fails. I do not think that this Committee should spin out the proceedings on this Bill over so many weeks and months that it frustrates the decision taken by the House on Second Reading.<br><br>
Since the depth to which hon. Gentlemen opposite wished to discuss this matter was made clear during the first three Sittings of this Committee, it is absolutely right that we should step up the number of Sittings per week. We shall continue to sit on Wednesdays at 10.30 a.m. I do not think anybody has any criticism or comment about that. That at least is "under the belt", and nobody takes the slightest objection to it.<br><br>
I then come to the additional times.<br><br>
Had it been suggested that we should sit at 10.30 on Monday morning, that would have been a great inconvenience to people coming from as far away as Bristol, Widnes, Accrington and Bromsgrove—perhaps even from Northfield. The hon. Member for Erith and Crayford would, I am certain, have had no difficulty in getting here. For my part, if that was what the Committee wanted, I would rearrange my life to do it. We all have to fit in with each other's requirements.<br><br>
But to sit at 4.30 on Monday afternoons does not cause hardship from constituents' point of view and many of us will be here for Questions and so on.<br><br>
It is always a matter for us, and there are some usual channels in this Committee as in other Committees. If for good and sufficient reason—I emphasise that—it did not seem sensible to proceed on a certain Monday afternoon because of business in the Chamber, then, by agreement, we could arrange not to meet.<br><br>
My hon. Friend may be influenced in his judgment by the speed at which matters are dealt with. I am not suggesting that they should be dealt with without adequate examination, but we all know that in practice one may deal with matters of depth in a slow manner or in a long manner.<br><br>
A friend of mine, a busy man, used to work extremely hard. He got up early in the morning, went to bed late at night,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 192</span>
and got through an immense amount in a day. He went on holiday, and when he came back I said, "How did you get on?" He said: "I do not know that I enjoyed it very much". I said, "Why was that"? "Well", he said, "There was not a very great deal to do, and time seemed to fill itself out. In fact, it took me two hours to write one postcard to an aunt about some arrangements later in the holiday". The postcard was difficult to compose, and he got absolutely right what he had to say. This illustrates that we can do things very shortly, or we can do them lengthily.<br><br>
I am not suggesting that we should do things less thoroughly, but we can do them speedily. If we do so, I am certain that my hon. Friend will be all the more co-operative with hon. Members about the afternoon Sittings.<br><br>
What I have said about Monday afternoon Sittings applies equally to Wednesday afternoon Sittings, except that there is even less objection, in the terms of what my hon. Friend said, to Wednesday afternoon Sittings, because we shall have all arrived from our constituencies two days earlier. It will not be a matter of having to catch an earlier train or making an earlier departure. The Motion will best enable us to make progress on a Bill which had an unopposed Second Reading.</span></p>
<p>Mr. Wiggin <i>rose in his place and claimed to move</i>, That the Question be now put, <i>but</i> The Chairman <i>withheld his assent, and declined then to put that Question.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Earlier this morning, I mentioned that there was very little information for the Committee to work on about regulations, standards of hygiene, sanitation, and so on—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are still on the Sittings Motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is à <i>propos</i> of the Sittings Motion, on the points introduced by the Minister.<br><br>
A cursory glance at the document—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not discussing the document now. I ruled that we could discuss it at a subsequent stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point of order—</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0219">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 193</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Maddan) began by saying that the House was not against the Bill in principle because it was given an unopposed Second Reading. He knows that I am not against the Bill in principle, as I recognise that a problem has been created by the pop festivals with which the Bill is aimed to deal.<br><br>
I am a little concerned by one reference which the hon. Member for Hove made. I hope that he will take the opportunity to correct it. He said that it was necessary to have a Bill to deal not only with pop festivals, but with other night assemblies. I think he may have made a slip of the tongue, because he did not go on to say what those other assemblies were. Although I have a great deal of sympathy with the aims of the Bill's sponsor in trying to do something about the problems of pop festivals—which we have discussed already, and into which I shall not go—nevertheless, the fear has been expressed by many of my hon. Friends that the Bill will have other effects, and will affect assemblies that take place at night which it was not the intention of the sponsor of the Bill to affect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maddan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To allay the hon. Gentleman's worries, in my opinion there may be other types of night assembly in addition to pop festivals which cause the same problems. The Bill, I suppose, has been drafted as it has been to take into account that eventuality. To that extent it is entirely wrong to imagine that the Bill is just—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. In any case, it has nothing to do with the Sittings Motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maddan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have made the point. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will see me afterward in order to reassure me.<br><br>
I should like to thank the Minister for circulating the extract from the report received by the Secretary of State. I at least am grateful to him for it. I recognise the unusual nature of that step. I shall read it with great interest during the Easter Recess.<br><br>
Where I disagree with the Minister is his statement—or perhaps it was the hon. Member for Hove—that we needed time for discussion, and that therefore we
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 194</span>
should meet more frequently during the week. For myself, the problem is not so much time for discussion as time for research and for consideration of the points made in the Committee. I make this point quite sincerely. One of the things that I shall not be able to do during the Easter Recess which I should have liked to do is to visit a pop festival. I have made inquiries but have been unable to discover any pop festival to be held during Easter. Before any hon. Gentleman rises to his feet—I can see one or two who are about to do so to give me this precious information—I am afraid that it is now too late. I have made my travel arrangements for the Easter Recess. However, if the Committee sits for long enough, hon. Gentlemen who have not visited pop festivals, of whom I am one, will be able to go to them. I believe several are to be held at Whitsun.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Boscawen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman cares to delay his travel arrangements until the Whitsun recess, he may find that we could welcome him to our constituency, from the way in which things are going at present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is delightful. It was Whitsun, was it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Whitsun.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very relieved, for I thought the hon. Gentleman was about to suggest that I visited a pop festival at Easter, and I am in fact going in the opposite direction. But if anybody knows of a pop festival in Lancashire, I shall be delighted to go to it.<br><br>
There is indeed a need, not only for myself, but for other Members of the Committee. I suspect that very few of them have ever had the experience of attending a pop festival. I know that the hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen) has; the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Woodnutt) has also done so, no doubt. But there are few members of the Committee who have had that experience. My sympathies are with the sponsors of the Bill in wanting to deal with the problems, but it would be helpful if more members of the Committee had the opportunity to see the problems for themselves at first hand.<br><br>
By abbreviating the period therefore, during which the Bill is to be discussed, we shall rob ourselves of that opportunity.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0220">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 195</span>
I return briefly to the point that was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) when he referred to the Local Government Bill. Six Members of the Committee, including the Minister, sat on the Standing Committee which considered that Bill.
