	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leo Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 11, leave out paragraph (	<i>a</i>) and insert:
	<br><q><p>(	<i>a</i>) after the words "giving of advice on contraception", there shall be inserted the words "and voluntary vasectomy (provided that the arrangements made for giving of advice on vasectomy shall include either the advice of a psychiatrist or advice given by a counselling service approved by the Secretary of State), and after the words "seeking advice on contraception", there shall be inserted the words "and voluntary vasectomy".</p></q>
I shall begin with a comment made by my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) on Second Reading when she wisely pointed out that this Bill is
	<br><q><p>"… based to some extent on knowledge of anatomy, physiology, psychology, psychiatry and surgery,"</p></q>
and that

The admonition given by the hon. Lady was one which could be addressed
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
to the House and to the Committee. Quite clearly, we are dealing with an extraordinarily delicate matter. We are presuming to say that there should be State and local authority intervention so that those who wish can decide, for ever, to give up their parenthood. There can be few more serious options open to any human being. Parenthood is the opportunity afforded to large numbers of people to reach a higher degree of maturation. It is through parenthood that we have our links with past and future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Sinclair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite appreciate the point the hon. Member is making, but surely, it is nothing new. This option has been open to and taken by women for many years. The choice is open now to men and women.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that the novelty of the situation is twofold. First, before a woman is sterilised there are usually other overwhelming medical reasons or she already has a considerable number of children. If the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that it is medical practice to select women who are unmarried, who have no children, and to sterilise them for non-medical reasons—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir G. Sinclair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that is not my intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he is suggesting that, I take his point, but he is not. He is confusing the Committee. How over-anxious the Committee is when I start to declare what I should have thought is a truism, that parenthood is of great value, that it links us with the past, with eternity, and with the future! When I say that, what anxiety it arouses!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Houghton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are going to have a rumbustious Committee. I make such non-controversial comments on which I should have thought there would have been general agreement, yet they arouse the distinguished Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party and also the idiosyncratic Member of the Tory Party to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Finsberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only anxiety on my part is that the hon. Gentleman should not seek deliberately to confuse the issue in his almost Oxford Union Debating Society speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0009">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I can make an Oxford Union speech in two minutes, then I do far better than when I speak in the Oxford Union. Hon. Gentlemen should contain themselves. Perhaps when they have heard what I have to say, they will not be so nervous as they so demonstrably are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saying that this is a fateful decision. It would be a fateful decision if a woman took it, as well as a man. Surely, nobody disputes this. Surely, nobody disputes that when women do take this decision, we find that it is done when women either have compelling medical reasons for it to be done or when they have a considerable number of children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am addressing myself to a time when, as yet, beyond the fact that the man must be 30, there are no such checks and, beyond that, it is suggested that a man should be able to make this fateful decision without the necessity—as the Bill stands at the moment—of any discussion or guidance of any kind. I know that certain hon. Gentlemen take a somewhat anarchic view, such as the right hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) who already, without anticipating his Amendment, has indicated quite clearly by it that he does not even want the 30 years of age provision. He believes so passionately, in this connection, in the freedom of the individual—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Houghton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask my hon. Friend not to anticipate my Amendment or my speech on it. At this moment he is moving his own Amendment. Can he not stick to that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Bill stands, the only check is the 30 years of age check. I have to take into account how I can suggest to this friendly Committee that there is a need for wise counselling before the fateful decision is taken. If the right hon. Gentleman thinks that I should ignore the impossibility of even a youngster of 18 having this operation, that is not what he is doing by putting down the Amendment. Clearly, I have to take that into account as a possibility. Is it being suggested, either in anticipating the right hon. Gentleman's Amendment, as I am, or, taking the sponsors' existing position—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must not anticipate anybody's Amendment other than his own.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to take into account the state of the Bill. With great respect, Mr. Fitch, I have to take into account the fact that I am asking the Committee, in the light of the age of the man, whether there should be counselling or no counselling. It would be quite wrong not to take account of the fact that there is clearly a view among some hon. Gentlemen that they could oppose or support counselling in the case of people who are even younger than 30 years of age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the usual course of events I should have thought that nobody would have a vasectomy without having counselling. I do not doubt that through the existing agencies, such as the family planning bodies and the Simon Trust, there are some forms of counselling. If anyone has taken the trouble to investigate and discuss with those who are engaged at the moment in vasectomy, through those or other agencies, they will find an extraordinary amount of criticism of the standards and criteria of counselling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to accept that all sorts of disasters could result from this operation, although many benefits could come from it. It could be a means of ending or creating intolerable marital situations. It could mean that people could have greater control over the planning of their parenthood, but, because of the irreversible character of the operation, it could also bring them the most appalling distress in the long run.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not have to take into account the obvious benefits. In supporting the Second Reading of the Bill, I accepted the principle of the Bill that there must be circumstances in which, as a measure of last resort, as my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) pointed out, vasectomy is a socially and personally beneficial operation. However, our task in this Committee is not to start zealously campaigning for this as part of a population programme. Our task is to examine the Bill so that, as far as we can, we avoid any of the difficulties of the minority who, for the wrong reasons or without sufficient forethought or because of unexpected later events, find themselves in deep trouble because they have had an operation that is irreversible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 	<i>The Times</i> this morning there is a letter from a research doctor, seeking to reprimand my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax, because in the debate she
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0010">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
emphasised the irreversible character of the operation. This doctor has suggested that in 50 per cent. of the cases it is irreversible, but he does not deal with the point, which the literature indicates, that even if the operation could be reversed, fertility problems may still remain. The reproof in 	<i>The Times</i> is ill deserved. We cannot act on the assumption that perhaps it could be reversed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phillip Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who has acted on that assumption in introducing this Bill? Every speech made in support of the Bill has been on the assumption that the operation is regarded as irreversible when people go for the operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. Friend; I know he has taken that point of view. However, when, on the morning of a Committee, one sees a letter of that kind reproving the hon. Lady, then, when presenting my argument as to why there is a need for counselling, I think I am entitled to draw the attention of the Committee to the letter and to warn them that whatever may be said there, it would be quite wrong of us to act in the individual case except upon the presumption that it is irreversible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the letter has a greater significance to the question of counselling than the misplaced reproof to the hon. Lady. It is demonstrating that there are a considerable number of people who, quite obviously, have changed their minds. One would not know of this matter at all. The Nuffield Institute would not have had the research which is available to indicate that a certain percentage of people have tried to reverse the operation, if it were not for the obvious fact that there are people who have changed their minds and have sought, either successfully or unsuccessfully, to undo what they originally did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us examine the situation in which no guidance is given. A young man who marries and has two children, may find afterwards that there is great marital trouble within the family unit. People react to marital trouble in different ways. When things are rocking within a marriage, it is sometimes believed that having another child will bring the parties together. Equally, however, when things are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
wrong within a marriage, when the frigidity of the woman is said to arise from her fear of another pregnancy, it is possible, as anyone who has read case histories on this matter will know, that she will try to persuade the husband that a vasectomy is a way to attain a degree of freedom in their relationship which could allow the marriage to be healed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Persuasive as such a suggestion may be, it is usually as foolish to believe that marital troubles can be healed by having another child as to believe that they can be healed by renouncing parenthood for ever. It would be unwise if a person in such marital stress obtained a vasectomy when what was, in fact, required was far more subtle marriage guidance counselling than that offered by a surgeon's knife.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Finsberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I gather that the hon. Member is submitting as the basis of this part of his speech that people might subsequently regret having had the operation? I wonder whether he has had an opportunity of digesting the Simon Population Trust report. It did a survey of 1,004 men who had had the operation and asked them if there were any regrets. Six of the men said, "Yes", which is 0.6 per cent. of the survey and of the respondents' wives 14 said "Yes", 989 said "No", 1.4 per cent. I hope the hon. Member will agree that what he has been saying is substantially contradicted by the Simon Trust which, after all, is recognised by most people to be a highly reputable body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that even the Simon Trust research in any way contradicts what I said. The percentage of women who regret it, on the basis of that report, bears out my contention. The Simon Trust are clients in their own cause. As shown by the independent inquiry, 16 per cent. of them, according to the most objective tests that could be made, were psychologically disturbed as a consequence. I accept the fact that the overwhelming majority appear to be satisfied, although it is pretty late not to be satisfied. Most people can make a virtue out of a fault when they know that the fault is irremediable, and this must also be taken into account. One must be quite fair about it.

But even allowing for the figure of the Simon Trust or, what I find much more

satisfactory, an independent account where there certainly was no preconceived view, and which went as far as 16 per cent., surely both those figures emphasise the need for screening, and effective screening. Remember that the Simon Trust have screening, and even when they have the screening of the type that they have, it is quite clear that a substantial percentage of the women in particular—and, in the case of the other report, of the men and women—felt most dismayed at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, since this is the case—whatever our preconceived views may be upon policies, or whatever our views may be upon the desirability of more rather than fewer people having this operation—should we not say that if it is at all possible we want to make certain that those who have it have pondered and considered hard and well before the decision is taken?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned in the House a personal case which came to my attention and which I found extraordinarily distressing. I will mask the facts so that the parties cannot be identified, but, beyond that, what I say will have verisimilitude with the actual situation. A man in his early thirties came to me professionally in order to start an action against a hospital because he claimed that his child had died in hospital as a consequence of the negligence of the doctors and nurses who were treating his child. When I examined the facts I could see, from what he told me and from further inquiries which I made, that there was no substance in the allegation, that the dedicated doctors and nurses had done more than one could demand of any human beings in order to save the life of that man's son.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The man had two children; the son had now died. When he came to me in his desire to make a scapegoat of the hospital, he did not tell me of his recent past. The recent past was, as I found when the unfortunate man had broken down and a catharsis took place, that he had had a vasectomy in comparatively recent months before his son had died. I regret to say that it was quite clear to me that there had been the most perfunctory guidance given to this young man. The position was, quite inevitably, that he felt, at least unconsciously, his own guilt. He believed, being a simple man, that retribution had fallen upon
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
him. Perhaps even more sophisticated men would have felt the same thing. But now he had lost his son, and he had lost for ever the possibility of having a son. People who feel a sense of guilt often try to project on to others their responsibility. Naturally, therefore, as so often is the case, he wanted to become litigious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a situation is not one which we should like to see occur, even if we wish to provide vasectomy. I do not suppose, whatever safeguards we put forward, that we can deal with every contingency in the future. But certainly when families are small, when they are young and when men are young, the realities of the situation must be presented to them so that they understand the natural hazards of life. If they make the choice, they should do so with a very clear understanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, we must accept the fact that the overwhelming majority of divorces take place between people who either have no children, where the matter is not relevant, or who have one or two children. If one examines the statistics, one finds that this is the position. Since that is the reality of the situation, we must accept the fact that we can anticipate, if vasectomy is proferred, that there will be drawn out of that section of people whose marriages are unfortunately going to break down, a higher proportion of people with small families than we may have otherwise expected. If a young man has a vasectomy while he is married, he is faced with the position that in the future, if his marriage breaks down, he can have no second family. If he remarries, his wife will be barren. That is an awful thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sitting on a Home Office Advisory Committee dealing with adoption, and I must say that I find that remark of the sponsor extraordinarily naive. Nobody who has delved into this problem has failed to discover the extraordinary yearning that comes from a large number of women in this country who regard children not as mistakes but as blessings. To suggest that it does not

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
matter whether some wives are involuntarily to be deprived of the blessings of motherhood by any action of ours, since they can adopt children, shows a degree of insensitivity which I am quite sure my hon. Friend did not intend to convey.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not also a common experience, and I am sure it is the experience of hon. Members in this Committee, that persons with an intense desire for children are often extremely reluctant to adopt them? Unfortunately, this is the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the case. It is an extraordinarily difficult matter. Many men cannot take this situation, because the child remains a constant reproof to them for their lack of potency. I do not understand how my hon. Friend can be so casual in suggesting that it does not matter and that the now sterile man and the barren woman are only in the same position as those who are sterile by the law of nature.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I say that I was the adopted child of, as he puts it, barren parents, I think my hon. Friend will agree that he is perhaps unwise to say that I am being casual or frivolous. Adopted children can be a very great blessing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not suggesting that my hon. Friend was frivolous. I had observed that he had commented that he was an adopted child. Each of us, when we come forward with propositions of this kind, must also have an insight into our own motivations as far as possible. I will say no more. This applies to us all, and there is a dynamic which often operates against us all. There are also patterns of behaviour among us, springing from our cultural and individual backgrounds. The hon. Member is not exempt from that because he has had the good fortune of having secure adoptive parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is quite possible that people would like to change their minds, and the question for any reasonable person to ask is how we can provide in the Bill a screen so that the choice is fully understood and appreciated and the deepest needs are taken into account. At the minimum, a psychiatrist should be available. Psychiatrists are held in high or low esteem
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
according to one's prejudice. One could talk in terms of much stronger safeguards than one psychiatrist, for they have the fraility of every man and woman. I have contented myself, in an endeavour to be realistic, with suggesting that there should be a psychiatrist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Laurie Pavitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend mean a psychiatrist or a psychologist?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mean what I say—a fully qualified psychiatrist, holding a diploma in psychological medicine, who I hope will be analytically oriented. In short, I am suggesting that, as one of the limits, there should be a psychiatrist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Shirley Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Member saying that there must be either the advice of a psychiatrist, or advice given by a counselling service?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have said "or" in the Amendment. I do not mask the fact that my contact with the existing guidance counselling services does not encourage me to believe that they are as strong or have as much insight as we should like. But have the Government taken any advice directly? For example, have they taken any advice from the Institute of Pschoanalysts on this issue? When, for example, we consider problems of adoption, we first go to the people who may know something about it from clinical case histories, before we give blank cheques to everybody. We want to know the views of the people who have to deal with the problems that could arise from the operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I heard the sponsor, my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead), make a passing reference—I do not know how deep it went—to the psychiatrists, but I should like to know whether the Government have received any paper. Have they gone to the Royal Medical Psychological Society? Have they gone to the Institute of Psychoanalysts? Have they examined the question in any depth before forming a view? Have they taken, as it would be irresponsible not to take, the advice of those people who are deeply concerned with the mental consequences of this operation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might help the hon. Gentleman if I were to tell him that I received a letter from the Royal College

of Psychiatrists supporting the Bill as it stands, but recommending that such an operation should not be carried out except on the recommendation of at least two medical practitioners, one of whom should be the family doctor and the other preferably a psychiatrist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged for the sponsor's frankness and helpfulness, but it is only what I would have expected. I regret that such a responsible suggestion is not in the Bill. If I had had the letter, I might have slavishly followed the suggestion of the psychiatrists, to whom, after all, one should go to ask about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An issue of such importance, touching upon the lives of a large number of the living and the unborn, should not be left to a letter passing to a well-intentioned hon. Member putting forward a Bill which in principle is needed. The Committee is entitled to ask what advice has been taken and, if it has not been taken, whether advice will be taken and what memoranda are in existence which the Committee can study. It is not good enough, although I welcome the sponsor's frankness, that it is presented in the form of a letter which is short and without adequate depth. I am sure that thinking has gone into it, but we are entitled to have some of the 	<i>ratio decidendi</i> which allowed the writers of the letter to come to such a conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To come back to the point which the hon. Lady made, in my opinion it would be highly desirable that the psychiatrist should screen an applicant. I have put in an alternative which is that it should be given
	<br><q><p>"by a counselling service approved by the Secretary of State".</p></q>
Perhaps the Secretary of State does not like it. We know what happened in the case of the Abortion Act when the Secretary of State agreed in the first instance, through his spokesman in this Committee room, to accept the fact that he might have to have some jurisdiction over the type of doctor involved in determining whether an abortion should or should not take place. The attitude was abandoned under the pressures of the Committee, the House and outside groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can it be suggested that the Secretary of State could vest such a serious matter in the hands of a local council to decide whether the guidance counselling is or is not up to the standards required? Is it
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
seriously suggested—I hope it is not—that the counselling can be determined by people who are not fanatics but extraordinarily zealous in pursuing this particular form of family planning, that they can decide who shall do the guidance counselling and what should be the qualifications of those who do it? Will it be a counselling of the kind that can be very patchy, as in the case of some marriage guidance councils? I hope the Secretary of State will not retreat from the position that we in the House should be able to ask him questions if we were in any way concerned that a counselling service set up to meet the requirements of the Bill was slight, inadequate or badly staffed. Unless we have the opportunity to turn to the Secretary of State to remedy any blemishes of this kind, the House will, by passing the Bill, have forfeited its major opportunity of supervision of an irrevocable and serious operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to indulge in hyperbole, but I hope the anxiety originally expressed by hon. Members when I began to speak is to some degree allayed. I presume that they are rational, intelligent men who are as concerned as I would be in making certain that people who should not have vasectomies do not have them. I act on the assumption that in their zeal for population programming, they are not indifferent to who has the operation as long as somebody has it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the voguish population lobby showed itself strongly in the course of the Second Reading debate, I presume that here we are dealing with the individual personal problems of people and families. I presume that we are talking about family planning. When I was assisting in putting the Family Planning Bill through, I encountered many different attitudes, and I expect that they still exist. There were those who wanted family planning and those who wanted birth control. There were those who thought that family planning meant planned parenthood, and those who, either consciously or unconsciously, did not seem to want to have children at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Worse than that. It was mentioned in the debate—women at risk.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following my hon. Friend very closely. Would he not accept that for some women pregnancy is the "disease" which they fear most, because for other family reasons and through the unconscious brutality of their husbands they are saddled for years with children whom they genuinely, for good reasons of motherhood, do not want?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have accepted that, certainly; otherwise I would not have supported the Bill and I would not have co-operated with Edwin Brooks in putting the Family Planning Bill through. Of course, I believe it, although one must not forget that with the coming of the pill, for many women the matter of choice no longer is left to the men. However, I do not want to be distracted. The hon. Member may be following me, but he is taking me into paths which are not within the rules of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely most of the Committee will accept that there must be some guidance. What form is it going to take? Who else should we go to except our psychiatrists and our medically qualified psychoanalysts? Who else can give us the screening? I think that I have not been strong enough in the light of the intervention of the sponsor, because quite clearly the psychiatrists would like more involvement. It sounds a very sensible suggestion to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Pardoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned earlier that we must all be concerned with our motives, and presumably the Royal College of Psychiatrists will not be entirely free of these. Will the hon. Gentleman therefore tell me, if I want a vasectomy, how long am I to spend with a psychiatrist whose advice I am to take, and how much will the psychiatrist get for his services?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the implication is that psychiatrists who are overstretched and hardpressed, and of whom there are insufficient numbers, are seeking payments from the small fees which would come from the local authority under the Bill, I think that the overwhelming majority would find it an enormous burden.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
However, I may have misunderstood the hon. Member; he may mean that psychiatrists should be consulted, since most people, like Members of Parliament, can be extraordinarily prestigious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pardoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. If it is going to be a very small fee, a very small amount of time will clearly be involved. Therefore, how can the psychiatrist know the problems that he needs to know in order that he can give advice? Also, if the psychiatrists are so overstretched, why should we burden them as the Amendment would do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are the dangers of rushing into vasectomy. I am not trying to wreck the Bill, but the Government spokesman indicated that it may be desirable for this issue to be considered some years hence when we have integrated the health services and the involvement of all the medical people concerned in the issue will be easier. I understand that there are difficulties in implementing it at present, but if we are going to do it, it would be the height of folly to say that because the methods of screening are not ideal we should have none at all. I am sure that the hon. Member would be glad if one or two people could be saved from what they regarded later as an act of folly. He, as a compassionate man, would want that as much as, if not more, than I do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend not agree that psychiatrists normally see fairly severely disturbed patients? They are, as he says, overpressed. Would he not further agree that there is a proposal, for which I think he claims some paternity, which involves provision for counselling, where at present contraceptive advice is being given? This would include referral to a psychiatrist if a severely disturbed person were involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Houghton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Fitch. Is this a one man band, or is it a Committee? May I suggest that you dismiss the rest of us until 1 o'clock, and let my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) conclude his speech?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that my right hon. Friend does not like what I am saying. I do not doubt that he finds it as painful

as I find his speech about large families being socially disastrous, but I had to endure that, and he will have to endure a great deal more. He does not speak on this issue for so many; on this issue he presents a very personal point of view. I hope that although he is the Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party he will not attempt to usurp the duties of the Chairman of this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interruption from the sponsor suggested that, whereas he could see some point in having screening in the case of a grossly disturbed person, he does not see the need for screening in the form which I have suggested in the ordinary case. However, let us look at the study of people who have had a vasectomy under the Simon Trust. The author comes to the conclusion that the proportion of psychologically disturbed people seeking the operation was much higher than the proportion of such people in the community as a whole. Therefore, we have evidence in this country—apart from the American evidence which I cited on the Second Reading—that there is an unexpected proportion of people who present themselves for vasectomy who should be screened. It is no good blinking our eyes to that, and a psychiatrist is professionally equipped to examine those cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pardoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend shakes his head. Who else? We are either going to psychiatrists or we are going to have counsellors who are supported by psychiatrists, as in the Marriage Guidance Councils. We have to have somebody. The Simon Trust already say that they have to have somebody. The Marriage Guidance Council, in its unit in Cardiff, has somebody. Nobody outside the private sector has yet suggested that we should not have anyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that men who can pay for it can walk into any surgery today and have the operation. It may be said that we are prissy and paternalistic; I appreciate that point. But we are saying that we have a duty to assist those who may seek a vasectomy for the wrong reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I right in supposing that prior to 1954 there was doubt whether any man could go to any surgeon and have the operation done for money?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There remains doubt about
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
that. The Medical Defence Union has given an opinion that the operation is lawful providing there is consent. There is no determined case law, but that is the opinion. As the hon. Member said, up to 1954 it was not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to be deflected; it is not I who is going up these paths. If the hon. Member's argument is that a man who has money need not have any guidance, and that it is therefore unnecessary to give guidance to others, I can only say that although that argument may appeal to those who are attracted to a 	<i>laissez faire</i> liberal doctrine it does not commend itself to me. When the State decides that it will provide services, as the Bill suggests, it has a responsibility to see that those services are administered in such a way that they will do the maximum amount of good and the minimum amount of harm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that there is a difference of philosophy between those who agree with me and those who adopt a 	<i>laissez faire</i> attitude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pardoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a 	<i>laissez faire</i> attitude; it is an egalitarian attitude. The hon. Gentleman is saying that it is quite all right for those who can afford it to make their own decision, unobstructed by the State, or by his Amendment, whereas those who cannot afford it and need help from the State must go cap-in-hand to the State, or to the hon. Member, or to some psychiatrist, and obtain permission. I cannot see why those who have money should be better qualified to make their own judgments than are those who do not. The doctrine that the hon. Gentleman is putting forward is that whenever the State tries to help poor people, through the social services, the Health Service, or any other way, it is entitled to take away an essential liberty. Does he really think that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a community we are entitled to try to save people from their own folly. It is true that some people can buy their way to the most lunatic of behaviour, but it is no part of the duty of the State to encourage people into such acts of folly simply because the wealthy can behave recklessly with impunity. The fact that so many acts of folly can be bought does not mean that we should legislate and institutionalise those acts of folly. That is a droll argument. When the hon. Member considers it, knowing

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
as I do his concern for those who may be less adequate than others—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pavitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend saying that these are all acts of folly? Is he not rather overstating his case? Some acts of folly may take place, but is he not now making the case that because this is an act of folly, although the rich may be as foolish as they like the poor must be protected—so there is one law for the rich and another for the poor?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in Committee. I understand that the principle of vasectomy is accepted. I accept it. I hope that I do not have to keep on saying it. I have said it. But now, in Committee, we are dealing with a refinement of the principle. I do not want to make Second Reading speeches; I am dealing with the question of screening, and trying to show why screening is desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Naturally I am directing my attention to what I freely acknowledge is a minority of cases. Fortunately we are not in such a masochistic condition that the whole of the community is likely to rush out tomorrow to be sterilised simply because we have passed the Bill. But we have to be on guard against those who, for ill-considered reasons, attempt to have a vasectomy when they would be better without.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put forward the view that the proper person to screen people is the psychiatrist. Why is there resistance to the idea of a psychiatrist? I ask my hon. Friend the Member for Willesden, West (Mr. Pavitt) because his intervention indicates that he does not want a psychiatrist. Whom does he want? He has indicated that he is ready to accept the principle of guidance. Who are the people to give the guidance? Does he advocate non-professionals? Will he exclude those who are clearly best equipped professionally to deal with the matter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The very fact that that seems to be suggested makes it necessary that if we provide the alternative of a guidance counsel it should be one who is overseen by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will agree that some people—however small a minority—who are now receiving vasectomy would be happier if they did not, that we must improve the guidance services and that, at the very least, the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
best way of doing it is to enlist the aid of properly qualified people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I apologise to the Committee for being a few minutes late. I should have raised this matter at the beginning of our proceedings. There is apparently no copy of the main Act available to Members. I am not raising this point in a delaying fashion; I ordered a copy of the main Act yesterday morning from the Vote Office and it was promised for this morning. It was not available, and I see that no copy is available in this room, which surprises me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the responsibility of hon. Members to obtain copies of Bills from the Vote Office. There is nothing that I can do about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. It is the responsibility of hon. Members to equip themselves with copies of the statutes and other papers, but if they are refused them at the Vote Office what is their remedy? The right hon.

We are being asked to amend the statute. If it is not available, how can we be expected to discharge our duties correctly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to cause any difficulty, but as the hon.

I am not saying that it was the Vote Officer's fault, but I was under the impression that I was going to have the document by this morning—and I believe that the Vote Office thought so, too.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Social Services (Mr. Michael Alison)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) pinpointed an important factor, namely, that the Government will have to accept new responsibilities and obligations if his Amendment is accepted. I therefore hope that the Committee will allow me to intervene, at what might seem an unusually early stage in a Private Member's Bill, in order to respond to the hon. Member's questions about the Government, and to put a particular point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Committee to reject the Amendment, but not all on the ground that we believe that counselling and advice are not necessary; on the contrary, we believe that they are vital in matters of family planning. Indeed, we believe that a good deal of counselling and advice is already inherent in the vasectomy operation. The hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) will agree that when an individual applies for a vasectomy operation, which inevitably involves an exchange with a medical practitioner, it is extremely rare for the decision to be made even in the first interview with that medical practitioner. A process of medical counselling is inevitable in vasectomy operations at the present time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that the maximum amount of counselling and advice is not desirable and necessary; I ask the Committee to reject the Amendment on a wider matter of principle, namely, that the requirement inherent in the Amendment is not only unnecessary but over-rigid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing here with what is admitted to be a partial sector. The hospital sector is entirely outside the ambit of what is proposed both in the Bill and in the Amendment. We are asking the country to accept that each and every patient should be subject to a specific procedure, formally laid down by statute in a partial area of application, outside the hospital sector and outside the private sector. We propose to create a procedure in which a psychiatrist is present at the counselling stage, as a filter, or a general counselling service is provided as an alternative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole Committee will probably agree that nobody should undergo a vasectomy operation in the expectation that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
it can be reversed. We know, that the reversal operation has a success rate of 50 per cent. and that in many cases reversal will not be available immediately, even given the 50 per cent. chance of success. Two vital factors must be borne in mind by all those who come forward; the operation is almost certainly irreversible, and even with the 50 per cent. chance a substantial time factor may arise, which may exacerbate the points of marital and social stress to which the hon. Member has so rightly drawn attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view it is absolutely right that the Committee should have stressed the necessity of not entering into this operation lightly or unadvisedly. However, it cannot be alleged in the same breath that a psychiatrist is vital in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We agree that there should be counselling advice, but we do not think that that logically and necessarily implies the use of a psychiatrist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The overwhelming weight of evidence presented to the Committee and to the Government—the Simon Trust is the obvious example—suggests that in the majority of cases vasectomy has no discernible effect upon mental health.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, I do not think that the hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) is insisting on the advice of a psychiatrist. The words of the Amendment are

many other ways,in apparently adopting the view of an interested party like the Simon Trust—peope who are bound to be clients in their own cause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am drawing attention to advice that has been given to me. The hon. Member asked me specifically whether we took professional advice in this matter. We did. My Department had access to a range of expert and professional advice, extending from the top of the Department right through the hospital service. We took a mass of extremely relevant and expert advice, which I need not specify because it would take too much time. I am drawing attention to evidence from the Simon Population Trust—evidence that is available to hon. Members in the House and in the Committee and to which reference has already been made. I want to quote some figures which struck me in looking through it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a sample of 1,000 vasectomies a deterioration in general health was reported in the case of two husbands and two wives against an improvement in the case of 115 husbands and 315 wives; in the latter group the improvement was ascribed to relief from anxieties. In terms of marital harmony, five cases of deterioration and 579 cases of improved harmony were reported—which obviously has a bearing upon the condition of mental health.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is generally accepted, why should the sponsor of the Bill—my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead)—receive a letter from psychiatrists indicating that they want to have an even stronger screening than I have outlined? Has he received a report from psychiatrists? Has he received a report from the Institute of Psychoanalysis? If he has, is he prepared to make them available to the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not have to make formal communications to outside expert bodies. A range of expert and technical professional opinion is available in my Department, from the top professional advisers right through the whole range of National Health Service hospitals. I have no doubt that the hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead) will have something to say about the letter that he has received from the psychiatrists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the advice from the Department has been so splendid why is it that the Department is now so worried about the Abortion Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Abortion is rather a different subject. I must not allow myself to be diverted. I hope that the Committee will accept my general proposition that the evidence is that the danger of mental ill health arising from the proposals in this Bill do not seem to be on such a scale as to justify the writing in of a specific requirement that psychiatrists in this limited field should, 	<i>de jure</i>, be involved in the process of counselling—a process which, I readily agree, is vital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Pontypool, with his usual eloquence, made a reference to psychiatrists being over-stretched and hard pressed, but they are over-stretched and hard pressed in the neediest field that the National Health Service has to deal with—the problem of mental handicap and mental ill health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is not absolutely vital that, under statute, they should be diverted from that field in order to practise in this counselling area, we would not advise the Committee to write in a statutory obligation that this should be an added dimension, or a new element, in their statutory duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is argued that the role of the psychiatrist is so vital that this overstretched and hard-pressed profession should be diverted by statute into counselling on vasectomy, the hon. Gentleman should have made the point slightly firmer by making it a requirement and not an alternative, or option. If their presence is so vital the hon. Gentleman cannot let the Committee get away with another kind of counselling service. In a sense, he has sold the pass. If the psychiatric counsellor is not a necessity, in the nature of the case, the hon. Gentleman is quite right to say that an alternative is available, namely, a general counselling service. I shall return to that point shortly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is because I am aware of the situation, and of the difficulties that exist, that I am trying to be helpful. In the work of marriage guidance councils a psychiatrist can often be in the background, available to give support and assistance to the counsellors. Therefore, I put it in that form. If the Minister
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
does not believe that psychiatrists are available, either directly or indirectly, does he not hesitate to give a blessing to the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not dream of going anywhere as far as that. In many cases psychiatrists will already be involved. Some of those who come forward for vasectomy will have come at the instance of psychiatrists in the first place. I do not imagine for a moment that psychiatrists will not be involved in the whole of this ambit of medical activity. Of course they will. Not only will they sponsor candidates in some cases; there will be occasions when, in the course of the ordinary local authority provisions, the service of psychiatrists will be called upon as part of their ordinary professional responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advising the Committee to reject only this part of the Amendment, since it has provided the two alternatives in any case, and since the role of the psychiatrist is held to be not so crucial as to justify writing into a statute an obligation specifying the services of a psychiatrist. The hon. Gentleman argued reasonably that an alternative was provided. He did not press the psychiatrist point too much, provided the rather more generally-drawn idea of an adequate counselling service—"approved counselling service" are the actual words—was accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without underplaying the importance that the Department attaches to the necessity for sound advice and good counselling, we ask the Committee to spare the Government the task of setting up the immense administrative machinery necessary for a Government-approved—that is, approved by the Secretary of State—counselling service in respect of the work of the 158 local health authorities. It would be quite an abortive requirement—if I may use such a tendentious word in this context—in that local health authorities have a terminal date set to their existence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A misconception!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The terminal date is 1st April, 1974. On that date local health authorities will lose their health powers. Those powers will pass to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is impossible to determine the form in which family planning, vasectomy, the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
whole range of these subjects, will be dealt with by him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I can tell the hon. Gentleman is that it is a physical impossibility to set up an approved counselling service to cover 158 councils of counties and county boroughs between now and 1st April, 1974. We should have set up the administrative machinery after a reasonable length of time. It would have been possible to scrutinise, examine and approve only a tiny handful of those authorities who would be responsible for placing their counselling service before us for approval. All that we should succeed in doing would be to spend a good deal of public money in setting up the administrative machinery, recruiting the professional staff, building the bridges between ourselves and the local authorities for the development of these counselling services—and the process of considering and approving them would hardly have started before they lost their powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee must recognise that we are dealing with local authorities who are not only being given far greater powers in the future—because the House holds them responsible—but at present have statutory powers, given to them by Parliament under various Statutory Instruments and placing upon them extremely onerous and responsible duties in respect of family planning, amongst many other duties, and who have recruited professional staff to discharge these duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is entirely wrong that in selecting this one important and sensitive field we should provide that these authorities should be subject to scrutiny from my right hon. Friend, because, it is alleged, they cannot be held capable of producing a professional and satisfactory counselling service on their own initiative and responsibility. That is to misjudge local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any case, part of the difficulty of prescribing either the presence of a psychiatrist or of an approved counselling service is that candidates come forward in so many different ways. Sometimes they come forward from a psychiatrist, and sometimes from a general practitioner. If they are to benefit from the public service provided there must be an exchange, at every stage, with responsible
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0020">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
local authority personnel for the minimum counselling inherent in the provision of family planning services—not least vasectomy, if we empowered them to take it on—in the exchange necessary between members of the public coming into the ambit of a public service and those professionally qualified to advise them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise and heartily corroborate and support the striking way in which the hon. Member for Pontypool emphasised the need to ensure that when and if vasectomy becomes available as a public service, through the local authorities, we should not lose sight of the vital importance of counselling. I can give an undertaking to the Committee—which may meet the case, if the Committee follows the Government's advice that this Amendment should be rejected—that in the light of what is said in the rest of this debate my right hon. Friend is prepared to consider—and either he or I will comment on it on Report—a formal communication of advice and guidance to local authorities in the matter of counselling in general, with specific reference to the new powers that will devolve upon them under the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I go no further than that. We want to weigh carefully what is said in the Committee. In any case, guidance will be necessary to local authorities on the passing of the Bill. In the light of what the Committee wishes and debates here, we undertake to make an elaboration of the guidance to cover the necessity of counselling and screening in vasectomy. For the reasons that I have given I believe that it would be unnecessarily rigid, and perhaps ineffective, to lay these specific statutory obligations upon my right hon. Friend—as would be necessary if the Amendment were accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Committee, regretfully, to reject the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Houghton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee will be grateful to the Minister for having stated the wisdom and common sense of the matter, in striking contrast to the speech of my right hon. Friend the Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse), who does not realise how tiresome and offensive he can be. He can scarcely make a speech on these matters without sideswipes and offensive innuendoes about others who are equally sincere and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
who have devoted an enormous amount of time and energy to achieve what they believe to be social reforms.

He is not in a position to form a personal judgment of the ability, the responsibilities, or the conduct of the Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party. If he wants to know why I will tell him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to return to the issue before the Committee. One would not have been able to say from the speech of the hon. Member for Pontypool what the Bill is about. One would have thought that it was an attempt to lay down the general moral and statutory law about vasectomy. As far as I can recall, only two references were made by the hon. Member to the fact that the Bill deals solely with the position of local health authorities and nobody else—not the National Health Service and not private practice. In the case of the Abortion Bill—which is such an anathema to my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypool—we were laying down the law of abortion. We were laying down what was lawful and what was unlawful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A pretty mess you made of it, too!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Houghton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We were laying down the circumstances in which abortion would be lawful. The Bill does not deal with the circumstances in which vasectomy is lawful. That is the fundamental distinction between the two Measures. My hon. Friend said that the Bill accepted the principle of vasectomy. That must be clearly understood from beginning to end in this debate. No legal stipulations are laid down in the National Health Service. No stipulations are laid down for private practice. We are now considering the question of the conditions that should be laid down for the extension to local authorities of the provisions of the Family Planning Act, 1967, to enlarge the scope of the services which may be provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For a long time some doubt has existed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0021">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
about the legality of vasectomy, but I feel that the real question is whether, in certain circumstances, a case for damages could be brought by some party who felt himself to have been damaged by the operation. But that is not the question with which we are concerned this morning. What is in question this morning is solely the conditions under which local authorities should be allowed to spend public money on the provision of these services. We are not laying down the conditions under which the National Health Service may spend much more public money on this and other matters; we are dealing only with local health authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next point concerns sex discrimination. Last Friday we discussed a Bill concerned with discrimination against women. Today we are discussing a Bill which discriminates against men, or could be made to do so. There are no stipulations relating to the sterilisation of women, and thousands of women are sterilised. According to an article by Dr. C. P. Blacker and Sir John Peel in the 	<i>British Medical Journal</i> of 1st March, 1969, information was given that in 48.7 per cent. of the cases of the sterilisation of women in their survey, the operation was carried out because of domestic and family problems—not necessarily medical reasons, although medical reasons apply to men in the Bill. I am against discrimination against men, just as I am against discrimination against women. I think that the equality of the sexes should apply in this as in other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very narrow Bill. It is a mistake to discuss here the whole question of vasectomy—its personal psychological problems, its possible implications and what it may do. It is largely irrelevant to discuss those matters in the light of the narrow provision that the Bill proposes to make. The Amendment attempts to stipulate conditions under which this service may be given. As the Minister has reminded us, the Bill is of purely temporary importance, and the Amendment therefore has only temporary significance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If all the health services, as now administered by local authorities, are to be transferred to the National Health Service in 1974, this will be an interim Bill, and whether or not the Amendment is made
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
it will have no longer a run than the Bill itself. I am afraid that in discharging our duty in relation to the scope of local authority services we may be laying down principles in relation to vasectomy which will govern the National Health Service and private practice later on. In this narrow connection we are not entitled to lay down general principles relating to vasectomy which might be regarded as having far greater importance and authority later on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one suggests that there should be no counselling at all. As the Minister said, the question is whether there should be a statutory stipulation of a specific form of counsel, outside the National Health Service and private practice, and in relation solely to the local authority service. The Secretary of State is given the unenviable job of approving a specific form of counselling service. We all know from past experience the difficulties that arise from imposing on the Secretary of State responsibility for authorising some standard, some permission, or some licence, under which services may be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has proved troublesome enough in the case of the Abortion Act, under which the Secretary of State has responsibility for granting licences to nursing homes in which abortions may lawfully take place. We all know the difficulties that have arisen there. But it is much more complex to stipulate, specify, and approve of a specific form of counselling service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend suggested that if we did not make provision for counselling services in the Bill there would be none, but they are there all the time. I have here information from the Family Planning Association about its procedure in connection with vasectomy. Plenty of counselling is provided for in the Family Planning Association's instructions to its practitioners. I have here "Sterilisation for Family Welfare", issued by the Simon Population Trust, and it is full of counselling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Pontypool tried to get my right hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, East (Mr. Crossman), when he was Minister for Social Services in 1970, to impose counselling upon the National Health Service. He did not get any change out of my right hon. Friend. In a Written Answer given on 9th March, 1970, in reply to my
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0022">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
hon. Friend, the Secretary of State said:
	<br><q><p>"Male sterilisation is performed under the National Health Service on clinical grounds. I am at present reviewing the position. I have no reason to think that doctors are unaware of the need for adequate counselling where this operaton is proposed and I understand that this is also stressed by voluntary organisations concerned."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 9th March, 1970; Vol. 797, 	<i>c</i>. 218.]</p></q>
This was the common sense of the matter. One does not have to hold the hand of all medical practitioners and surgeons in matters of this kind. They are fully aware of their responsibilities. It would be a mischief to put what my hon. Friend suggests in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rather than have a mutilated Bill go through the House on this subject, I should much prefer no Bill at all. If this Amendment were put in the Bill, it would make the Bill unacceptable to me. I would use all the resources that other hon. and right hon. Members have used on -similar occasions to block it, because it would be quite unacceptable as part of a Bill which authorises local authorities to do, in their wisdom and at public expense, an operation for poorer people which can be done outside and under the National Health Service without similar stipulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept and welcome the Minister's indication that, if no such stipulation were put in the Bill, the Secretary of State would give his advice to local authorities. That is perfectly proper. The Family Planning Association and the Simon Population Trust gives advice. No doubt some advice goes through the machinery of the National Health Service. I have no objection to—on the contrary, I welcome—the advice which may be given to local health authorities in this matter. That is the proper way to do it. A great variety of conditions lead people to want to have this surgical treatment, and not all conditions can be analysed, much less resolved, by a particular form of counselling. Psychiatrists have become a new discipline in our professional life. We did not think much of them at one time. An anti-abortionist does not think much of them now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

to elevate one discipline in medical or surgical advice to provide the counselling for persons wishing to have this kind of treatment. What other kind of counselling might be available is not made clear by the Amendment. One might just as well say that one cannot get a divorce unless one has had the advice of the Marriage Guidance Council, or that one cannot do anything without the benefit of some State-approved counselling service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Houghton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no ground upon which a divorce can be refused unless the counselling service has been utilised. The law does not make divorce conditional upon it. In deciding 	<i>ad interim</i> what conditions shall be attached to the power of local authorities to extend their family planning services, we must avoid laying down principles and conditions which would be quite unacceptable if applied to other services as well as unacceptable if applied to this service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why one must look at proposals of this kind with the utmost reserve, with respect to their full significance in this context and in wider contexts. I am in favour of having the minimum of statutory stipulations on matters of this kind, when the medical profession and all the services of practitioners that may be brought to bear should be suitable for the occasion.

My hon. Friend the Member for Pontypool cited again this morning the. case that he referred to on Second Reading. What he did not tell us then, and what he has not told us this morning, is whether
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0023">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
that was a vasectomy under the National Health Service or under private practice. It is important, when quoting an example, to know under whose auspices the operation was undertaken, if it had such devastating consequences. It certainly could not have taken place under the provisions of the Bill, so whatever was lacking in counselling and whatever the consequences it was not the fault of the Bill. It may have been the fault of another service—the National Health Service or of private practice—but it was certainly not the fault of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a friend who had a vasectomy operation quite recently. He is happily married and has a family of a size which satisfies his paternal and domestic ambitions. He and his wife are both young. The pill has quite devastating side effects for the wife and the solution to their problem is for him to have a vasectomy rather than leave the wife either to undergo considerable distress on account of the effect of the pill or to risk another pregnancy which they do not want by employing other and perhaps less reliable forms of contraceptive. Is it suggested that he, a highly skilled professional man, should have a psychiatrist to examine him before he can go to the local authority? Or must he undergo some other statutory counselling service composed of heaven knows whom to tell him where his duty lies or where the danger is?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As most people would in the circumstances, he went to his own doctor, who is the person people should go to first. After his own doctor, he went to a surgeon. The counselling was done amongst intelligent people in an intelligent way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see any reason to interfere with that kind of responsible behaviour in connection with this difficult and delicate topic. Local authorities will exercise their responsibilities properly, as most of them do. They are not compelled to give family planning advice at present or to provide services for unmarried girls or all-comers under the 1967 Act. Some local authorities have laid down certain conditions and others have laid down others. This is a matter for the wisdom of the local authorities, which are the elected bodies. Are we now so lacking in confidence in elected representatives, while preening ourselves on being the quintessence of wisdom and of political and social responsibility as Members of

Friend in view of the low state of comradeship in the Parliamentary Labour Party manifest this morning in the person of its distinguished Chairman, the right hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton). I disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypool that the Bill is needed in principle. However, Parliament has given it a Second Reading and in this Committee it is our duty to make it less objectionable than it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary is always very courteous and helpful, but I was disturbed by his speech because it appeared that he had become an advocate for the Bill. Perhaps I am wrong. If he wishes to refute that, I am willing to give way to him. At times he became not only an advocate of but positively enthusiastic and even evangelical about the Bill. However, there is no doubt of the importance of the Bill and the Amendment. I should have thought that everyone in the Committee would approach the Bill with great care and compassion and carefully consider this very important Amendment which sets out certain safeguards and conditions under which this operation can be carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have quoted from the report of the Simon Population Trust on vasectomy, showing a lack of concern and consideration for those unfortunate people who had suffered as a result of this operation. I do not wish to impugn the motives of anyone in the Committee. Whether we are humanists or Roman Catholics with large families, we are all here to do our best and to examine the Bill fairly. It is no good the right hon. Member for Sowerby saying that it is not very important and that it merely relates to local health authorities. It is a Bill which raises fundamental principles. No one should be deaf to the moral issues and the ethical and philosophical considerations raised: what is man, and what are his rights over his own body, life and personality?
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
It is true that vasectomy is legal; but it is legal for therapeutic purposes, for the saving of life and health. I must not anticipate a subsequent Amendment to change the Title of the Bill, but this is the National Health Service (Family Planning) Amendment Bill, so it clearly relates not to therapeutic vasectomy but to vasectomy for the purpose of contraception. It therefore raises important and difficult considerations of law. It is not just an administrative Measure which provides a facility which is generally recognised to be legal and proper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If passed, the Bill would enshrine in our law the complete legality and propriety of vasectomy for the purposes of family planning and birth control, which may be valid. Here the law is in considerable doubt. The legality of sterilisation has been the subject of controversy in medical and legal circles for many years. The legality of surgical operations, it has been held by courts through the centuries, can be brought in doubt if their purpose offends public policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a Second Reading speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, with respect to the hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead), it is not. I am trying to dispose of the argument that we can rush through the Bill because it does not raise any fundamental issues. This was stated by the right hon. Member for Sowerby and the Committee is entitled to hear a reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since Lord Justice Denning's judgment in 1954—and other judgments which other hon. Members more learned in the law than I have no doubt studied—there has been some doubt about the legality of this operation for other than therapeutic purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member must not slip a card in. He knows that Lord Justice Denning's decision was a minority decision in the case of Fraser 	<i>v</i>. Fraser.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, and I am not trying to state what the law is. This is a matter of debate. However, if the Bill is placed on the Statute Book, Parliament will have decided something
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
which has been obscure and the subject of serious controversy before, namely, that this operation may be performed—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member must relate his remarks more closely to the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. I was trying to deal with the point that we should not be too cavalier with this Amendment and with the Bill as a whole, but I will now proceed further with my argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is such a serious matter for anyone contemplating vasectomy that he should receive counselling and the best possible medical advice before undertaking a step which is irreversible. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said that in his view it is an irreversible operation, and that was the view of my hon. and medical Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford), speaking on the Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Proper advice being available in advance is the purpose of this Amendment, and this is brought out well in the document with which hon. Members have been provided by the Simon Population Trust in which hon. Members can find cases of people who have had deep regrets and oases of people who have suffered in their health because of this operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no good saying that in the overwhelming number of cases the customers were satisfied—what a horrible expression. It is no good saying that in the overwhelming number of cases satisfaction was given by this operation. We ought to be concerned with the minority, if it be a minority—and we have to take this on trust. We must ensure that that minority is considered. We must consider whether it is possible to reduce or eliminate that minority by seeing that this operation is undertaken, not lightly, but only after the fullest advice has been made available to those who contemplate it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that even those figures come to light after the so-called screening of the Simon Trust? There is no question of them not going through the so-called sieve which it operates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Of course, this document is helpful to hon. Members who
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0025">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
are in favour of the Bill. As my hon. Friend has just said, the Simon Population Trust has provided us with backing for this Amendment and the figures contained in this report help to put the case for it. I am surprised that anyone should wish to resist it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not insist that a psychiatrist should advise in every case. I am surprised at the right hon. Member for Sowerby. Why should he say that all anti-abortionists are against psychiatry? I am an anti-abortionist, but I am not against psychiatry. I do not understand what he is talking about unless he is trying to stir up a bit of heat and confusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pardoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to clear up one point in my own mind. The Simon Trust survey shows that a small percentage of people afterwards wished that they had not had this operation. How certain is he, and what evidence does he have to show, that any form of counselling before the operation took place, whether by a psychiatrist or a counselling service, would have ensured that any of those people comprising the 2 per cent. who objected to it afterwards would not have had it done? How does he know that the counselling service would have picked those people up, and has he any evidence for that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the Committee to page 18 of the report of the Simon Trust which refers to a case where regrets were expressed by both the husband and the wife and a marriage where a child had been lost shortly after the operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Finsberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if my hon. Friend would complete the quotation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not quoting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Finsberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend was reading from the document. In one marriage a child had been lost and the other couple had been warned by their doctor that there would be repercussions. Presumably this means that they went ahead in spite of that and they would have done so even with a psychiatrist. My hon. Friend is usually fair, but I think that half his argument falls to the ground.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to be fair. If I were not I should not express appreciation for the information provided to us. My hon. Friend says that, having
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
rejected advice from their doctor, these people would not have taken advice from a psychiatrist. That may or may not be so, but all the regrettable results of the availability of this operation indicate that we should try to devise some machinery to reduce the number of cases where there are regrets or ill effects after the operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pardoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member cannot get away with that. He cannot suppose that any form of counselling service will ensure that someone does not slip through who will regret it afterwards. Of course there will be a percentage. Does he say that if we set up the most sophisticated counselling service in the world 2 per cent. or 3 per cent. of the people will not regret having the operation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No machinery in this world is perfect and no counselling service will be perfect, but because there are failures in machinery set up for the benefit of the public that is not an argument for not using it. I think that the hon. Member is being a little perverse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support this Amendment because it seeks to ensure that the best possible advice is available, and I fail to see how anyone in this Committee can resist it. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Minister said that "counselling is vital"—those were his words. Perhaps it is not vital to the hon. Member for Cornwall, North (Mr. Pardoe), but my hon. Friend, with the full weight of the Department behind him, says" counselling is vital". Later in his speech he spoke of "the vital importance of counselling".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend said that he did not want a burden to be thrown on the resources of the National Health Service or the local authorities by this Amendment. He seemed worried that if this Amendment were carried it would impose a heavy burden. I should like the burden to be reduced by not having the Bill, but be that as it may.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He exaggerated the burden when he gave us the number of local health authorities in England and Wales and then said what a terrible business it would be if all this great apparatus of counselling had to be set up. This Bill does not provide that local health authorities in England and Wales shall take advantage of the Bill. It gives them certain powers if they wish to use them. I dare say that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0026">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
many local health authorities will not wish to embrace these powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of clarification, I do not think my hon. Friend has pinpointed the burden which may be placed upon my Department. We shall have to act on the assumption that all local health authorities will take advantage of this Bill. We cannot afford to have a machinery of scrutiny which, in the event, proved to be inadequate to cope with all those who were submitting specimens for scrutiny. We shall have to act on the assumption that all 158 authorities will set up counselling services which we shall have to examine individually. This is the administrative burden which looms before us if the Amendment is accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that only one-third of the local authorities are at present taking advantage of the Family Planning Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not that rather reasonable? I should have thought there might be a greater reluctance to take advantage of this. No doubt my hon. Friend has made inquiries, but, in any case, I understand that it is part of my hon. Friend's case that the provisions of this Bill will not endure for long and everything would be under a different system, anyhow. I did not think that that was a powerful argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disturbed by the speech of my hon. Friend, who seems to have become an enthusiast for this Bill. I should have thought that some detachment, at least at this stage, would be in order. I think he might have listened a little more to the Committee before he gave the considered view of his Department with all the great apparatus of expertise, knowledge and advice which was available to his predecessor at the time of the Abortion Act which has led to the greatest public revulsion. I recommend my hon. Friend to treat with circumspection advice he may receive on these matters, not to be too involved in this Bill or too enthusiastic at this stage, but to listen to the views of his hon. Friends and hon. Members who may take a different view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to look at this Amendment in as detached a way as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
It is somtimes difficult in Committee to remember quite what we are discussing because the speeches tend to stray, but I shall concentrate on the Amendment before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) has an either/or in his Amendment, because that leads to vagueness in the discussion. Faced with an alternative, one is considering two things and could decide on one, or the other, or neither.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or both.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or both, except my hon. Friend said either/or, not both.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am saying is that local authorities proceed where they have either psychiatrists or the other service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But a complication arises. The hon. Member for Chigwell (Mr. Biggs-Davison) said that he would be content with one man, a psychiatrist—nobody else, just one man. Apparently, this psychiatrist, as one individual, is able to give the advice that a patient would require. The alternative is a group of people, but the group is not clearly specified. It simply says, "a counselling service". Apparently the Secretary of State, in his wisdom, is able to decide whether this counselling service is adequate. It may or may not include a psychiatrist, it does not say who would be included, but the Secretary of State would know whether it was capable of dealing with these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither of those alternatives is ideal. As has been pointed out, a psychiatrist may be necessary. On the other hand, if one's patient has a wife with a cardiac condition who has already had four children, and the social circumstances are bad, a psychiatrist is probably not necessary in such a case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He could get it under the National Health Service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am dealing with cases on the waiting list for which there is not availability in the National Health Service and which may be dealt with by local authorities. There is only a limited number of these operations under the National Health Service at the moment, with a large waiting list of, I think, 10,000. We are dealing with people on the waiting list, who will not simply be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0027">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
men who take it into their heads to have a vasectomy but men who have serious social or medical reasons for having a vasectomy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary has pointed to serious practical difficulties in the way of implementing the Amendment, whether it be the "either" or the "or" that we agree to. He has pointed out the limitations, in view of the reconstruction of the health service which is to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the right hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) correctly pointed out that we do not, in National Health Service hospitals operations or in private vasectomy operations make it necessary for a counselling service approved by the Secretary of State to see every case; nor, indeed, is a psychiatrist seen in every case of sterilisation. We have sufficient confidence in our general practitioners and surgeons. But in practice there are many people counselling such patients, apart from general practitioners and surgeons. I believe that nobody undergoes this operation without being counselled in many ways already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not underestimate the power and responsibility of the local authorities, democratically elected bodies wielding power over large sums of money. The Bill will give them a further responsibility. I do not see why we should now detract from this responsibility by saying they should only carry out counselling with the approval of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all these reasons, I feel that the Amendment is a trifle—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Finsberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not so brash as to say "unnecessary". I am trying to be detached. I think that it is ill phrased and ill considered. We should not be forced into a position where we say that no local authority can carry out this operation without a psychiatrist or a rather vague counselling service approved by the Secretary of State. I do not think that either of those alternatives is satisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that it will be for the convenience of the Committee if I intervene at this stage. I am new to these matters and this position. I hope that this will not be an area where a maiden strays too far, or even, perhaps,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
as far as my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse)—though we all concede that he never quite leaves the path of virtue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to him, to my other hon. Friends, and to the hon. Member for Chigwell (Mr. Biggs-Davison), who moved the Amendment, that the one point I wish to reiterate by way of assurance today is that the whole purpose of the Bill, a small amending Bill—made necessary, as much as anything else, by Ministry Circular 36/71 making clear that vasectomy services could not be provided within the ambit of the National Health Service—is to make more secure provision for the giving of advice, counselling and so on where vasectomy is concerned. That is, both before the operation takes place and in adequate follow-up afterwards, within, and with the full backing of, the hospital services available. This will be the case if the Bill goes through. That is why I believe that the Bill is itself a safety measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will bring the whole vasectomy operation, and the process whereby people approach this matter, within the ambit of the local health authorities and the National Health Service. I am sure the hon. Member for Chigwell will agree that that is better than the present situation, where the vasectomy operation, about which some reservations have been expressed in the Committee, is left outside that orbit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that there can be situations in which the complications of the operation give cause for concern. But I say at the outset to my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Pontypool that we do not want to create in the fabric of the Bill a structure so intimidating, so drastic in the methods of counselling which have to be used, that people are driven out to the private sector where these operations are done, as we know, with far less scrupulous processes of counselling. To erect a structure which intimidates a person wishing to have this operation and seek advice about it would be counter-productive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee of the procedures which are followed now by the Family Planning Association clinics, for example—I think there are 17 of them—which carry out this operation. They, and similar services, if the Bill goes through, will be integrated within the range of family planning services available under
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0028">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
the 1967 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not true that there is inadequate scrutiny of cases coming forward, or even that there is inadequate scrutiny in some of the other projects which have been mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member talked about a so-called sieve for the Simon Population Trust cases. A so-called sieve which has been effective in 99 out of 100 cases is a pretty efficient sieve. Of course, there is the case of the 1 per cent., and that 1 per cent. which we are discussing, the 1 per cent. which we must safeguard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept this figure of 1 per cent. We have Dr. Helen Wolfers' article. I was trying to avoid mentioning it. I do not know the woman; I have only read her papers. I do not believe that she had any biases. She obtained the support of the Simon Trust in order to do her survey. She arrived at a figure of 16 per cent., and that is a very serious figure. So I do not think we help ourselves by trying to minimise the incidence of risk, although fortunately it is apparently as low as 16 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very well aware that my hon. Friend has read Helen Wolfers' article. She spent most of the time in that article tearing to shreds some of the medical sources he quoted in the course of the Second Reading debate. I shall deal with Helen Wolfers' article at a later stage. I shall also deal with some of the matters which he raised. I do not recollect, for example, that Helen Wolfers recommended that there should be any form of compulsory psychiatric reference before anyone should have gone through the complete counselling procedure. What I would say to my hon. Friend is that if we are looking at the 1 per cent., we ought to consider first of all the processes through which, within generally responsible quarters, those seeking advice about this operation now go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it would be true to say that the referral process at the moment is usually that the man goes to his general practitioner first. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) said, that is the perfectly proper procedure in these matters. The man goes to the family doctor first. He then probably goes to a family planning clinic or some-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
thing of that kind and he is referred to a surgeon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to quote to the Committee the procedure followed at the clinic in Cardiff. I heard the hon. Member on other occasions say that he is a bit sceptical about the claim of this clinic in Cardiff, that 1,500 cases have gone through without any untoward incident. I personally am somewhat impressed by that. According to an article in the 	<i>British Medical Journal</i>, the procedure there is that the doctor who interviews the couple when they come to the clinic has
	<br><q><p>"training in contraception and psychosexual patterns. The discussion was designed to determine whether sterilisation would promote the welfare of the whole family unit. A decision was made after many factors had been considered—medical, social and emotional. The merits of both female and male sterilisation were discussed, and close co-operation with the gynaecologists facilitated treatment for the wife, if thought necessary."</p></q>
Then there is a whole series of procedures which were gone through and cross-references which had to be taken, which are the recommended standard procedures in all family planning clinics in this sort of situation. I submit to my hon. Friend that in most cases that kind of procedure is adequate, and more than adequate. Whether we come on later to the reservations which Helen Wolfers has expressed, or whether we come on to see whether we cannot find some merit in my hon. Friend's Amendment, it should be placed on record in this Committee that the overwhelming evidence is that where this procedure is properly carried out the result is successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that Helen Wolfers has found cases where this is not so. In a very interesting letter sent to the 	<i>British Medical Journal</i> after Helen Wolfers' article appeared, Mr. Michael Humphrey pointed out that in the majority of the cases where Miss Wolfers found dissatisfaction with the operation, the psychosexual problems were there before the operation. The hon. Member would agree with that. What we are discussing here is how we identify these psychosexual problems which exist in this small minority of cases, on present evidence, from this survey—though I could quote half a dozen international surveys to back up the general findings of the Simon Population Trust which was taking a much wider sample.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0029">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
Let us look at these cases. Do we, for example, need to put into the Bill the question of advice by the psychiatrist? I, like my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill), am somewhat puzzled by the "either/or" provision in the hon. Gentleman's Amendment. I am not sure that I can see the merit in it. I am not sure, if psychiatric advice is so necessary, that the hon. Gentleman does not want to write it in as a pre-condition. I am also not sure whether or not the hon. Gentleman has looked sufficiently hard at the parent Act. It is quite clear here that not only must there be approved advice—the wording is inserted in Section 1(1) of the original Act—but also that if someone was severely disturbed and sought contraceptive advice and had obvious problems within the family unit, the question of referral to a psychiatrist would be possible in those cases under the existing legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to look, therefore, at the question of psychiatrists. I have bowed, as far as I can, to my hon. Friend by reading out to him, since I had mentioned it in the Second Reading debate, the letter I got from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, which expressed unqualified approval for the Bill as it stands. What they said—and I read the passage out—was that where a second opinion is taken it should be that of a psychiatrist. As the hon. Gentleman has pointed out, this is only natural. To adapt the immortal words of Mandy Rice-Davies about Douglas Fairbanks— "They would, wouldn't they?" They are, after all, the Royal College of Psychiatrists. They are unlikely to put in a recommendation that psychiatrists should not be concerned in these matters, that psychiatrists should not be consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take some comfort from the fact that they support the Bill as it stands. I also take some comfort from Professor Pond, the professor of psychiatry at the London Hospital, whom I quoted in the Second Reading Debate, who says, amongst other things, on the issue of doubt:
	<br><q><p>"If there is any doubt at all one should get specialist advice, not necessarily from a psychiatrist but, for example, from a good social worker in the appropriate branch of the social work profession who can probably obtain important information that one may not have the skill or the time to acquire."</p></q>
I think that this is right. I also think
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
that the sort of training in psychosexual problems possessed by doctors giving advice, and which they are instructed to have when these family planning clinics have been set up to specialise in vasectomy, is the kind of line on which we should proceed. The services which are provided by psychiatrists as such are themselves largely, are they not, for severely disturbed cases? I should have thought that psychiatrists are pretty overworked already with such cases. I should also have thought that such cases can be identified by the sort of counselling procedures which we are discussing in the Bill. I will say in a moment what I think of the assurances we have received from the Minister. I think they have gone a long way to show that proper counselling will be stressed by the Government if the Bill goes through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that it would be appropriate for psychiatry to be written into the Bill. I have not seen any evidence from even those who express reservations about the procedures so far followed and the screening processes followed that psychiatry should be written into the legislation in this way. I think there is in the parent Act sufficient protection for those who are coming to seek this advice and who wish to make certain that it is approved advice.

I should like to welcome what the Under-Secretary of State has said in this context this morning. It is true that the Department will have to think very carefully about the wording of the circular which is to be sent out to the local authorities. I want to say to my hon. Friends and to the Committee generally that I would want to be satisfied that the kind of wording which the Government have in mind in terms of this circular, giving advice to local authorities, covers as wide a range of counselling as all of us who are concerned about the possible complications and consequences of this legislation would wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Pontypool said that we should prevent disasters and intolerable marital situations. I entirely agree, but I must say to him that he knows as well as anyone that we cannot legislate these things out of existence. One can only legislate out of existence intoler-

able marital problems if one abolishes marriage, and we are not suggesting doing that. Marriage itself involves an irrevocable action; marriage itself may for some people be disastrous. I would like to see much stronger counselling provisions before people involve themselves in matrimony, but I am not suggesting that, at every stage, in order to rule out the occasional mistakes that might occur, we should build into the fabric of statutes provisions for each of these things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope my hon. Friend will withdraw the Amendment. I want to look very carefully, and I know that my hon. Friends will, at the form of words which the Government are proposing in a circular to the local authorities, should the Bill become law. If I was not satisfied with it, I would be happy to consider on Report an Amendment in general terms covering vasectomy where approved methods of counselling have been followed. I can see no merit in attempting to be as specific, in this curious and dichotomous way, as my hon. Friend this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the advantage of the Committee, I must correct the hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Phillip White-head) on a point of fact. I think it would be impossible for me or my right hon. Friend to lay before the Committee or the House the draft of the circular which we might or might not issue to local authorities, arising from the passage of the Bill if it passes all its stages and receives approval in both Houses. I undertake to consider issuing specific guidance to local authorities if the Bill is passed, highlighting and specifying in an unusual degree—unusual in the sense that we shall not have specified this topic before—the necessity and the relevance of counselling in the matter of the provision of vasectomy services by local health authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I undertake to do this in the light of what is said in this debate and what may be said on Report, and I shall hope to have something further to say on Report. However, I cannot promise to lay before the Committee or the House the draft of circulars which my Department issues direct to local health authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend try to persuade the Minister to reconsider
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
that? We are being asked to give him a blank cheque. The confidence which some of us have in the hon. Gentleman's Department, as a result of our experiences over the Abortion Act, is not so great as some of us would like. In the circumstances—and I say this in the interests of the sponsor and of the Bill—I hope that he will persuade the Minister to make certain that we see the draft before Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the Under-Secretary has said. I shall study carefully what he says on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I say to my hon. Friends the Members for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock) and Pontypool (Mr. Abse) that I hope, in consideration of what has been said by all hon. Gentlemen this morning, that they will withdraw their Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of my hon. Friend's intervention, I should be surprised if the advice given to the hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Phillip Whitehead) by the hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) were not acted upon. As my hon. Friend the Minister was able to make his statement in the period of the discussion of the Amendment, if the hon. Gentleman wishes to take up that intervention, he ought to do so at this stage. I imagine that he would be in order to do so, since the Minister was in order in his intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Pontypool will know that I saw his Amendment and intended to put my name to it, but through an oversight I did not succeed in doing so yesterday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support him in his Amendment. However, I have one or two questions to raise. One which was raised earlier concerns the lapse in 1974. I want to know much more, from the point of view of the whole Bill and as it will be altered if the Amendment is accepted, about what exactly will be the effect of the Bill. Will it be taken over by the Ministry in 1974 and then become a Ministry Bill? Will it become part of the 1967 Act? What will happen to it? Obviously, the 1967 Act, in so far as it refers to local authorities, will not disappear because of the magical date of 1974.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is out of order. He must not anticipate any future legislation or ask about future legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg you to be helpful on this small point, Mr. Fitch. The Minister raised this matter of the relevance of the Amendment because the Bill would have no relevance in 1974.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can remain in order by referring to the consultative document already published, setting out the proposals that the Government have in view for the development of the health services, amongst which is the proposal that all local health authorities should lose their existing powers—and that would involve these existing powers, if they are taken—and they would automatically pass to the central Department. I cannot forecast in what form they would emerge and whether they would emerge in the present shape or form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly what I am terrified of. We discuss an Amendment to a Bill, and we have absolutely no idea, even after the Minister's kind and helpful intervention, what sort of place it will have in 1974.—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]—My hon. Friend the Member for Chigwell (Mr. Biggs-Davison), who made a more precise and better speech than I, intervenes, "Withdraw the Bill". I am not allowed to do that, and you would rule me out of order, Mr. Fitch, as you ought to do. But I am allowed to discuss the Amendment. I shall discuss it, certainly not at any great length. The hon. Member for Pontypool made a quite brilliant exposition, with most of which I agreed completely, but I cannot go quite as far as he does in his general approval of the Bill, even if his Amendment were accepted.—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]—The hon. Member for Willesden, West (Mr. Pavitt) made an interjection, which I could not hear, from a seated position. If he wishes to intervene, I shall have no hesitation in allowing him to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pavitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made an aside to my hon. Friend. It was out of order and I would not wish to waste the Committee's time in making an interjection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is most kind of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
hon. Gentleman. He is almost as kind as one of the former speakers in the debate, the right hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Is any of this burlesque in order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is bordering on the vicinity of being put of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am so grateful to you, Mr. Fitch. I shall continue to be as careful as I can and to keep rigidly within the rules of order. It would be unseemly for further members of the Committee to refuse to brook interventions, as has happened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I shall be happy if the hon. Member will get back to the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the best possible advice, and I will do so immediately. One of the things that worry me, and which was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford) and on which he was called to order, absolutely rightly, by you, Mr. Fitch, was the question of legality. I must pray your indulgence, Mr. Fitch, because I wish to come to the question of legality from the point of view of the Amendment. The Amendment talks about the advice to be given to young couples or older couples—if we have any luck later on they will be very much older couples—who, on the advice of their own doctor perhaps, or because they feel obliged to do so because they are having terrible fights—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that this is a family problem? Therefore, the correct person to give counselling is the family doctor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
