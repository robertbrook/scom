	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I wonder whether it is in order for me to refer to proceedings in the Chamber last night. During the proceedings on Report stage of the Finance Bill the Financial Secretary to the Treasury made a statement to the effect that the noble Lord, Lord Sandford would today make a statement of great relevance regarding the future and well being of historic churches. The debate concerned the implications of VAT on churches as a whole. In the light of the statement to be made today by the noble Lord, Lord Sandfordâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that I have heard enough to know that this is not really a point of order. It might be permissible to raise the matter in the course of debate, but it is not within the ambit of this Bill. The Bill has had its Second Reading, and it is the job of the Committee to proceed with the Bill as it knows it to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>PRESERVATION OF ENVIRONS OF ECCLESIASTICAL BUILDINGS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully appreciate the defects of this Bill, since I have not had expert outside advice on its drafting,
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
and I also appreciate that it is unlikely to proceed beyond this morning's Committee stage. At the same time, the Committee affords an opportunity to debate a topic of considerable interest and importance, and one which has excited a great deal of attention throughout the country since I first attempted to introduce a similar Bill in May of last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Clause seeks to amend the provisions of the Civic Amenities Act, 1967, by requiring local authorities to designate conservation areas for the purpose of ensuring the protection of the environs of every cathedral and grade A church building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) deals with about 2,000 grade A ecclesiastical buildings and 42 Church of England cathedrals. Thirty cathedrals, plus Westminster Abbey, are already in designated conservation areas, but it appears to me and to many other people that all our most important ecclesiastical buildings should be protected as far as possible by having their environs so designated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause would also require local authorities to consider requests to designate conservation areas in the vicinity of all places of worship of intrinsic architectural and historic importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our great heritage of religious buildingsâ€”cathedrals, churches, chapelsâ€”contributes much to the beauty of the landscape and the dignity of our times. They are admired and enjoyed by those of all faiths and of none. It would seem, therefore, that stronger legislative protection is necessary for them. So often they are the focal points of town and country scenes. Perhaps I may quote Ruskin, which would be entirely appropriate in a debate of this nature. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Great nations write their autobiographies in three manuscripts: the book of their deeds, the book of their words and the book of their art and architecture; not one of these books can be understood unless we read the two others but of the three the only trustworthy one is the last."</p></blockquote>
Commenting on this in that famous series, "Civilization", Lord Clark said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On the whole I think this is true. Writers and politicians come out with all sorts of edifying sentiments but they are what is known as declarations of intent. If I had to say which was a truer commentary on society, a speech by a Minister of Housing or the actual buildings put up in his time, I should believe the buildings."</p></blockquote>
That is no reflection either on my right hon. Friend the Minister responsible for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0416">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
housing or my hon. Friend who is present this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned here with a vital part of the fabric of our civilisation. The provisions of the Clause seek to combat the unthinking destructive acts of those planners, developers, and industrialists, who so often have neither a regard for architectural beauty or harmony nor a sense of history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In subsection (3) I refer to the Historic Buildings Council and the Historic Churches Preservation Trust. That is in connection with the provision that would require local authorities to consider requests to designate conservation areas in the vicinity of places of worship of intrinsic architectual and historic importance. It is important that we should not be seen to be proposing some sweeping change without building in proper and adequate safeguards and precautions. It is because of the accumulated wisdom and experience of the Historic Buildings Council and the particular knowledge and experience of the Historic Churches Preservation Trust that I write them into the Bill at this stage. I fully appreciate and acknowledge that this formula may not meet with the approval of the Government, and I should be happy to consider alterations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I first sought to introduce a Bill of this nature in May, 1971, I was inundated with letters from all over the country. It would bore the Committee beyond endurance were I to quote vast numbers of these. They not only told stark, and very often tragic tales, of churches falling into disrepair, and of the loving efforts of devoted congregations being frustrated, but also terrible tales of beautiful village and town centres, and lovely areas of the countryside, being despoiled because of the insensitivity of planners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I came across one example of thisâ€”a church which I attended in Lincolnshire for many years. We woke up one morning literally to the sudden sound of the bulldozer, and with piles of bricks being deposited within a matter of feet of the chancel wall of the lovely Norman church, with its Saxon tower. The Vicar telephoned me, and we discovered to our absolute horror that planning permission had been given for a bungalow to be erected on this piece of land. We founded a preservation society within 24 hours. We raised Â£1,000â€”it was not at today's
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
land pricesâ€”within a week and we bought the land and saved the church. That was a success story. So often the stories are not so successfulâ€”the ending is far from happy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to refer to another example from the Midlandsâ€”from Coleshill, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mr. Speed). I mention this particularly because the Vicar not only wrote me several letters but asked me to go to see him. Together with my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden we spent a Monday morning looking at the lovely church and flats which had been put up obscuring its environment. "They shout down the church", says the vicar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To quote from the local newspaper:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Council flats being built in front of Coleshill Parish Church were in 'violent contrast' to the church buildings, Canon Frank Morgan, the Vicar, said."</p></blockquote>
He added that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the reddy-blue bricks are reminiscent of Victorian institutions and the black mortar is like that used in prisons."</p></blockquote>
This lovely church, which was surrounded by large Georgian houses, is now completely cribbed, cabined and confined by rather ugly, gaunt blocks of flats. My hon. Friend the Member for Meriden could do nothing about that, nor could I, or anybody else. It was a graphic illustration of something that could have been prevented had the law had more teeth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is because examples like Meriden can be multiplied throughout the country that we write the Clause into the Bill. No one would suggest that the Civic Amenities Act, 1967, is not a splendid piece of legislation. No one could suggest that we share no regard for these important matters, but we are dealing with matters of national importance. On a local front, when there is a contest between conservationist and the developer, it is often the developer who wins, because he has the big financial battalions on his side. A brief discussion of the Clause should give us a chance to sound the tocsin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Clause concentrates on the environment of ecclesiastical buildings. On behalf of East Suffolk County Council and West Suffolk County Council I want to make one or two points of reservation. I am still heartily behind the thinking which underlies the Bill and the initiatives which have been taken by the promoters thereof. I am sorry that my
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0417">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
name is not appended, so keenly do I feel about the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) requires conservation areas to be designated around every grade A church. According to information from the East Suffolk County Council in England there are 3,000 grade A English parish churches, rather than the 2,000 quoted this morning. In East Suffolk there are 50 or more, and in total throughout Suffolk, and including Ipswich, there are 140 grade A ecclesiastical buildings. This ignores other church buildings of architectural merit. There is no sectarian aspect to the Bill. One must bear in mind what local authorities are doing in terms of creating conservation areas. In East Suffolk a vigorous programme has been pursued since 1968. The county council has designated 18 conservation areas in 17,000 villages. The church conservation areas in East Suffolk would take 10 years' work, assuming that no more work were done on village conservation areas lacking a grade A church. This is an important point to be borne in mind in terms of the perspective in which we place the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, I am told by West Suffolk County Council that it has made three conservation areas and is in the course of negotiating at least a dozen more. The impact of this on its staff has been considerable. The vast increase in the number of planning applications this year has meant the transfer of some staff from development plan work to development control which, in turn, will mean that some matters, such as conservation areas, could not be given quite the same attention as in the past. This is quite apart from the difficulty of replacing planning staff between now and reorganisation in 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the generality of the local authority's objection, in terms of the sheer pressure of work that this would create. I should be most grateful if the Government spokesman could indicate how local authorities might see their way through the pressing and difficult circumstances in this context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, in relation to subsection (1) a specific point is made with great force by both East and West Suffolk County Councils. They object to the fact that discretion is taken away from the local planning authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to put out that, contrary to
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
popular beliefâ€”and I think these remarks apply also to subsection (3)â€”the designation of a conservation area does not itself grant any extra or special powers of control to the local planning authority. Most fences, minor house extensions, exterior painting, and so on, remain outside planning control, even though, if insensitively carried out, they can have a serious effect on the appearance of an area. In cases where planning permission is needed, it gives the local planning authorities a strong case for refusing unpleasant development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the point to concentrate on and bear in mind in terms of my immediately preceding remarks about the weight of work upon depleted or insufficient staff. Applications for developments and planning permission within a conservation area must be advertised, and that informs the public. It is also an administrative and cost burden on the local planning authority and inevitably slows down the grant of planning permissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister might also care to comment on that point, given the tremendous pressure on the building fronts which I am sure all hon. Members are experiencing around the country at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My specific comments are on the fact that the Secretary of State and not the local authority has the power to define the boundaries of conservation area. That intrudes very much upon local autonomy. Moreover, in terms of the work already carried out in local conservation areas at least by the two county councils, part of whose area I have the honour to represent, extra work would arise with a time scale of 10 years for East Suffolk alone, assuming no more work to be done on village conservation areas lacking a grade A church.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid that I misread my references. Subsection (2) is the one that gives the Secretary of State and not the local authorities the power to define the boundaries of each conservation area. I have commented on subsection (3) in terms of the general implications of the conservation area. My final comment is that on the whole one can say only that subsection (3) is rather vague. Perhaps the Minister would care to comment on that aspect also.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sydney Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join in congratulating my hon. Friend on introducing the Bill and should like to say how proud
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0418">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
I am to be associated with it by being a sponsor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This part of the Bill is critically important. It is interesting to realise that in this century we have already put up more buildings than in all other centuries added together. It follows that we should take that much more interest in those relatively few remaining old buildings and make more effort o preserve them. In the name of progress, we too often allow the bulldozer to knock down many of our old buildings, which is a dreadful shame.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the idea that 2,000 ecclesiastical and 42 cathedral churches should be the centres of conservation areas. At the moment about 1,750 conservation areas are designated, and I am sure it is the Government's intention ultimately to try to designate about 5,000. It is also important that we recognise that the setting of a building is equally important, and that is why I particularly welcome the Clause and what it seeks to do. The setting of a building is important to that building, but the interesting thing about the environments of many of our churches is that the buildings themselves happen to be of deep interest, and contribute to the character of the area. Even if my hon. Friend were not trying to preserve the ecclesiastical churches, the Clause would be a good thing in that it is trying to preserve the buildings surrounding them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I endorse what my hon. Friend said in his reference to a Minister of Housingâ€”that perhaps the buildings which are erected in his tenure of office are more important than the Measures he puts on the Statute Book. My hon. Friend is really paying a tribute to architects, and I agree with him on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to subsection (2), I am pleased that my hon. Friend has not tried to fix the extent of this conservation area in relation to a point from the ecclesiastical building. Obviously, this must be a matter of difference in each church area, and I am sure that my hon. Friend goes the right way about it in subsection (2) which provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State, after consultation with the Historic Building Council and Historic Churches Preservation Trust, shall"</p></blockquote>
in effect, decide the extent of the particular area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I give my hon. Friend one word of warning about the excellent Clause he is recommending to the Committee? If
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
these areas become conservation areas that will, unfortunately, be no guarantee of any permanence of the buildings. My hon. Friend the Minister will be aware that many of us have been trying to strengthen the legislation in conservation areas. I hoped that all buildings in such areas would need to be the subject of permission before demolition, but my right hon. and hon. Friends felt that they could not go that far because it would be inhibiting in certain areas, such as Chester, Bath and, I think, York, where the whole of the city within its walled area is a conservation area. I should not agree with that. Every building in a conservation area ought to be protected. Consequently, the word of warning I would give to my hon. Friend is that when he gets the Bill on the Statute Bookâ€”as I hope he doesâ€”his troubles will not necessarily have ended, and it will not be any guarantee that those buildings will remain for all time. Indeed, there are people who are sharp enough to try to get round any laws which are created. There was a glaring example of that at Town Farm, Wheathampstead, where, in spite of the fact that the local planning authority tried to serve a preservation order on that building, the owners of the site managed to get round it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One question which has exercised my mind, and on which the Minister or my hon. Friend may be able to help me, is whether there is a legal definition of an historic church. I know that there is a Historic Churches Preservation Trust, but I do not think there is a legal definition of the difference between an historic church and an ordinary church. With that slight doubt in my mind, I recommend the Clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Money</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join with my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Handsworth (Mr. Sydney Chapman) in congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) and in welcoming this Measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see the validity of the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) so far as they affect a county like Suffolk, with its enormous number of grade A listed ecclesiastical buildings. I was interested in the note he passed to me and which he received from East Suffolk County Council pointing out that, of the 140 grade A Church of England ecclesias-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
tical buildings, one only was situated in my constituency, in the County Borough of Ipswich. It is, however, possibly the town church which is most at risk, and not necessarily the Church of England town church.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever else in the way of glories my hon. Friend may have in his constituency, I challenge him to put forward any non-Church of England church as fine as the Unitarian church in Ipswich. It is probably one of the greatest splendours of English Nonconformist church architecture of the eighteenth century.

What I wish to stress is that it is in a town environment that this type of building is particularly at risk. It is against a double background that this legislation is particularly welcome and necessary. First, there is enormous pressure on land values, even of the smallest parcels of land, in urban settings. Secondly, the congregations which, in the centres of towns, were very large at the time these churches were builtâ€”I am thinking particularly of late seventeenth and early eighteenth century churchesâ€”have become very small and, particularly those of the non-established Churches, have the greatest difficulty in being able to support their financial burdens. The pressure on such a congregation to sell off parcels of land within the immediate environment of their church must become very strong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is against that background that I particularly welcome the Clause, in the light of the provisions of Clause 3, because it will enable the immediate surroundings of this type of building to be maintained fittingly and in a way which cannot at present be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill has my name appended to it and it does not behove me to be too critical. On the other hand, in effect, this is the Second
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Reading debate, which we could not have on the Floor of the House. It might be as well if we looked at the Bill from that angle and, since Clause 1 is the guts of it, looked particularly at this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was thrown in at the deep end of the preservation of historic churches when I came into the House in 1966. Shortly thereafter we found that York Minster was tumbling down, and it was necessary to mount an enormous campaign to preserve it. I sought to persuade the Government of the day to subscribe to the appeal fund. I was making splendid progress with the then Prime Minister, now the Leader of the Opposition, towards a substantial contribution to that fund, but the powers that be came across a speech of the Archbishop at the Church Assembly in 1912 casting doubt upon whether the Church of England required help from the State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seemed to me that the authority was a little dated. Nonetheless, the authority was used despite the contribution that the State might have made at that stage, along with the very real difficulty that any substantial contribution to the York Minster appeal fund would have more than outweighed the total resources put into the historic building fund for that year. It was that, rather than the alleged connection between the independence of the Church of England and any contribution to the fund, that finally stifled that endeavour. We managed to obtain permission from the Minister for any local authority in Yorkshire, or with a Yorkshire connection, to make a contribution to the fund. In fact, the local authorities made substantial contributions amounting to about one quarter of the total sum contributed. So we made some progress in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second criterion for turning down the original application was the most important one in this respect. Although some help would be given to the preservation of the surroundings of historic churches by subsection (1) and although some help might be given through the Historic Buildings Council and the Historic Churches Preservation Trust in subsection (2) to the repair of churches, the resources that would be available from them are so limited, and the call that would be required to preserve our historic churches is so great, that they do not match up to each other.

	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
It is no fault of the hon. Gentleman who sponsored the Bill that that should be the nub of the problem, which cannot be dealt with by the Bill. It is a brave attempt to help, but it does not go to the root of the problem. In my constituency there is a considerable number of historic churches in addition to the Minster. If each were to have a conservation area around its exterior to preserve it in its context it would more than cover the present number of conservation areas that have been designated in such a historic city as York. I remind the hon. Member for Birmingham, Handsworth (Mr. Sydney Chapman) that it has a call upon public expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it was Lord Esher, in his report on York, who said that there is no point in designating a conservation area unless one is willing to pledge the resources to make that conservation area into a reality. Anyone can draw lines on a map; what matters is whether the local authority and the Government are prepared to spend the kind of money on conservation areas to improve and to keep the areas in the kind of condition that we want. It is the question of resources that one has to resolve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This would be a useful attempt to move the State in the right direction and to break this rather silly embargo upon help for the established church and for other churches where the buildings are still in use. We shall have to go considerably further if we are to preserve the immense richness of this country in ecclesiastical building. We must come to a stage where the State designates certain buildings as of such importance that it is prepared to take over their maintenance, allowing the religious organisations to continue to use them for religious purposes. It happens with certain churches in Scotland. I believe that one of the cathedrals in Glasgow is maintained by the Ministry of Works, and the charge falls upon the account of the Department of the Environment and not upon the church itself. I tried to bring about the same system for York Minster, so that the Department could take over the masonry department of the Minster. That would have been a considerable contribution to the running costs of that enormously expensive historic church. Unfortunately, the then Minister of Works could not agree that the two things were of the same principle. I can see no difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that this is a help, but it is nothing like the answer to the problem. Anybody who walks round York on any day of the week will see why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My only other criticism of the Bill is the reference to the established Church of England. I should have asked the sponsor about this before, but I ask him publicly now, so that he can reply publicly. If a building is a grade A building, why is it necessary to refer to that
	<br><blockquote><p>"cathedral church of the established Church of England"</p></blockquote>
unless one is asking for support for all cathedral churches, irrespective of their architectual or historic merit? Many cathedral churches would undoubtedly fall into the grade A category. Other cathedral churches would be regarded as being of neither historic nor architectual merit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman pressed me, I would have to say that I do not regard Bradford Cathedral as being in either category. It would not serve the interests that we have at heart to make a conservation area around Bradford Cathedral, when most of the surrounding buildings have only recently been put up by a speculative property dealer who did a deal with the Bradford Corporation to redevelop the city centre and, on the whole, made a terrible mess of it. It does not seem to me that one could say that Bradford Cathedral ought to qualify under the Clause. I am certain that without very much effort one could think of other cathedral churches that would fall into a similar category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am doubtful about this provision. It also raises the vexed question whether the established church ought to have a special place in legislation of this kind. I do not think that it should, and I do not think that it wants it. The recent report on Church and State indicated that the whole relationship between the established church and the State is in any case under review. That certainly seemed to be the opinion of the last church synod. On that ground, the sponsor might think again and refer instead to buildings of historic and architectural interest which claim merit by reason of the building itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall never solve this problem unless we are sufficiently radical to take

	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
over the buildings themselves and, in a sense, lease them back to the religious authorities for their use. That would be much more satisfactory and acceptable to the public at large.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I allowed some latitude because there was no Second Reading debate.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the record, in replying to the debate on the Clause, could the hon. Gentleman outline the background of the constitution of the Historic Churches Preservation Trust, the way in which it is run, and the people involvedâ€”and also the Historic Buildings Council, which is also referred to in the Clause? That might be very useful. I believe that the backbone of our legislation is founded on Committee proceedings, which are not sufficiently appreciated, but I am sure that an explanation by the hon. Gentleman would be welcomed by those people who read the OFFICIAL REPORT of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend further assured me that he fully understood that we would not be able to determine any practical matter this morning. In the light of that assurance I did not think it necessary to reply to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As they have shown by their record, the Government have the greatest concern for the preservation of our heritage of fine buildings. Over 140,000 buildings are now listed, and the number is being increased by 8,000 a year. The annual sums available for grants on the recommendation of the Historic Buildings Council were increased by over 40 per cent. in 1971-72â€”from Â£700.000 to Â£1 millionâ€”and by a further 50 per cent. this year, to Â£1Â·5 million. No one can doubt the Government's concern. We therefore have warm sympathy with the broad objectives behind the proposal specified in the Clause. We must not be regarded as indifferent to the historic interest of churches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About 2,000 churches are listed in category A, and a further 9,000 in categories B and C. The Government have the greatest sympathy with any proposals aimed at preserving this magnificent heritage of ecclesiastical buildings which, with their surroundings, form so important a part of the architectural and historic wealth of this country. For that reason, a great deal of thought is being given to the most effective way to achieve their preservation. There are bound to be difficulties to be overcome in dealing with a complex and long-standing problem, but the Government approach the question of historic churches with appreciation and sympathy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been illustrated on a point of order, it would not now be appropriate for me to deal with matters that should more properly be discussed on Clause 3, but it is desirable to consider the subsections of Clause 1 and repeat the important statistic that in England over 40 cathedralsâ€”42 was the figure mentionedâ€”of which over 30 are already in conservation areas and at least 2,000 grade A churches.

The present law requires local authori-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0422">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
ties to determine which parts of their areas are of special architectural or historic interest, the character or appearance of which they consider it desirable to preserve or enhance, and to designate them as conservation areas. They are given a free hand in the matter and do not need the consent of the Secretary of State. About 1,700 areas have been so designated in England. Designation is an earnest of the local authority's intention to pay special attention to the character of the area when exercising any functions under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1971, and the Local Authorities (Historic Buildings) Act, 1962. It draws the attention of other authorities and the Government to the importance attached by the local authority to the preservation and enhancement of that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause requires a local planning authority to designate a conservation area even if nothing in the area other than the church itself was of special architectural or historic interest. It seeks to interfere with the freedom of local authoritiesâ€”which are directly elected bodiesâ€”and their discretion to manage their affairs. The provisions of the Civic Amenities Act. now incorporated in the Town and Country Planning Act, 1971, give local authorities the freedom to work out their own programme of designations. My hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge produced evidence that the Committee must seriously consider with regard to that aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many local authorities work to a programme for designating conservation areas. It is wrong to interfere with their priorities in this way. Subsection (2) requires the Secretary of State to consult the Historic Buildings Council and the Historic Churches Preservation Trust on the extent of each conservation area that is made as a result of the direction, having regard to the need to preserve the scenic and architectural beauty and character of the environs of the building to which the subsection applies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Historic Buildings Council is fully committed in advising the Secretary of State on the exercise of these powers under Part I of the Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments Act, 1953, and could not reasonably be expected to take on this additional responsibility. A Bill that is now before the House imposes new duties upon the Council, in advising the Secretary of State on grants for the con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
servation of outstanding areas. It could not take on this job, which would also affect many conservation areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This subsection would also lay a heavy burden on my Departmentâ€”a burden for which additional staff would be needed in order to do what is essentially a local authority job. No doubt the hon. Member wants to limit the number of civil servants. Imposing upon the Department an immense job, requiring detailed knowledge, which the Department is not staffed to undertake and which local planning authorities are competent to do, is not the way to proceed. The Historic Churches Preservation Trust, which makes a valuable contribution to the cause of preservation, is not a statutory body, nor are its trustees likely to be well versed in what is primarily an environmental problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want briefly to refer to subsection (3), which is concerned with ecclesiastical buildings other than Church of England cathedrals and grade A buildings. It provides that a local planning authority shall give special consideration to the desirability of designating as a conservation area the environs of any such building, if it is requested to do so by the ecclesiastical authorities concerned, provided that, in the opinion of the local planning authority, after consultation with the Historic Buildings Council and the Historic Churches Preservation Trust, the building is of sufficient historic or architectural importance to merit such consideration. The powers of the Historic Buildings Council are limited to advising the Secretary of State, and it would be impractical to extend these to cover the giving of advice to local authorities, even if they were not already committed in carrying out their present statutory responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge, who gave valuable evidence from his knowledge of local circumstances in Suffolk, mentioned conservation areas, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Handsworth. I believe that improvements in the position of local authorities will take place under the proposals in the Town and Country Planning (Amendment) Bill now awaiting its Report stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hands-worth might not have been aware of some of the practical difficulties that I have tried to outline when he described this as an excellent Clause. I hope that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0423">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
he will accept my assurances about the Town and Country Planning (Amendment) Bill. From his expert knowledge as an architect and town planner, he knows that great consideration has been given to the points that he raised in the proceedings on that Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Money) made the important point that the importance of churches and religious buildings other than those of the Church of England must be given full consideration. I accept that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for York (Mr. Alexander W. Lyon) gave an account, which I appreciated very much, of the progress made in the important task of preserving York Minster. He described in reasonable terms the practical difficulties about the proposals specified in the Clause. In the light of these remarks and of the points that I have had to make myself, I have to ask my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) to agree to this Clause not receiving the approval of the Committee. I ask my hon. Friends and hon. Members opposite to resist the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Money</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend deal with one specific point? One of the matters of greatest concern to those of us who represent urban constituencies is that in certain constituenciesâ€”such as my own, that of my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford) and the hon. Member for York (Mr. Alexander W. Lyon)â€”many churches which form an essential part of the urban landscape are not necessarily of such merit as to entitle them to be classed as grade A buildings. Nonetheless, Ipswich, York and Norwich all have examples of fine mediaeval churches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend can give us an undertaking that the Government will look again and hard at this very real problem, which has been raised over and over again by an admirable organisation called The Friends of Friendless Churches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important practical point about churches in urban areas. I should like to wait until the debate on Clause 3, when I hope to discuss the considerable efforts that are being made to carry on discussions, negotiations and studies which will result in a practical policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was disappointed by
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
much of what my hon. Friend the Minister said. I am grateful to him for attempting to deal with this matter in some detail, and am sensible of the validity of many of his comments, butâ€”and I hope that I do not sound churlish in saying thisâ€”I detected a note of what might be called hurried complacency underlying his remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not yet completely grasped this nettle. We have to devote considerable attention, in the highest quarters of Government, to the problems before us and to the allied problems associated with historic buildings. Perhaps what is neededâ€”I say this with no disrespect to my hon. Friend, whose portfolio is absolutely bulgingâ€”is a Minister with specific and absolute responsibility for our architectural heritage. That might be the way in which the Government could best show their concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend's request. We have had a reasonable discussion, and I hope that we shall have an even more detailed debate on Clause 3, which is really the heart of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, I shall not reply at length to the points made by my hon. Friends and by the hon. Members for Acton (Mr. Spearing) and York (Mr. Alexander W.

	<div class='title'>APPEALS AGAINST PLANNING PERMISSION IN CONSERVATION AREAS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a short Clause. It is important but, for reasons that I mentioned a few moments ago, I do not wish to speak at great length on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The importance of the Clause arises from the fact that it is, in a sense, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0424">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
most revolutionary provision in the Bill. It would give ecclesiastical authorities a statutory right to appeal against planning within their conservation areas. It would thereby extend the provisions of the Civic Amenities Act by specifically mentioning ecclesiastical authorities, and would write a new principle into our planning law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sad examples of recent yearsâ€”I mentioned Coleshill earlier this morningâ€”indicate that those most adversely affected by various planning proposals do not have the statutory right that they should have to protest against those proposals in good time. Therefore, although I must again acknowledge that in drafting the Clause might be deficient, it enshrines an important principle, and I hope that when he comments on it my hon. Friend will feel able to indicate that there is a basic Government sympathy with what we are trying to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have the greatest doubt about this Clause. My hon. Friend rightly pointed out that the Bill would be a radical Measure if put on the Statute Book, since this is the first time that someone would have the right to appeal against a planning permission given, as opposed to the present law, under which any applicant has the right to appeal against a planning application refused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, although I in one sense share the feelings of my hon. Friend, I feel that we should examine this question more closely. I want to make two points. First, in one sense it is untrue that people do not have a chance to make representations before a planning decision is taken. Hon. Members on both sides would probably agreeâ€”certainly Government Ministers wouldâ€”that we are trying to get more public participation in planning matters. Too often the public does not like planners and planning decisions because it feels that they are negative. The idea surely is to try to make this a more constant instrument of town planning laws, so that people feel that they have a right to determine some of the things that happen to their environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I am right in saying that under Section 28 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1971â€”which was Section 57 of the 1968 Actâ€”the local planning authority is required to advertise details of a planning application in a conservation area. If there is a planning applica-
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
tion within a conservation area the local planning authority, not the applicant, is required to post a notice in a conspicuous place to say that representations have been made, and can be made, before the local planning committee, and ultimately the council decides whether that planning application should be granted or refused. In one sense there is a safeguard for people living in conservation areas to make representations about any physical change in their environment in that conservation area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Money</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seem to remember that my hon. Friend was responsible for an extremely enlightened piece of legislation in the first Session of this Parliament which, unfortunately, did not reach the Statute Book. Would he not agree that one of the strongest cases is for the extension of the early warning system, in the conservation areas in particular, to those people most likely to be affected?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Money) for mentioning that in a Bill that I was privileged to introduce in the 1970-1971 Sessionâ€”the Urban and Rural Environment Billâ€”I wanted virtually all planning applications to be made the subject of site notices, so that anyone in the area would know about planning in conservation and other areas. I subscribe to that principle. I want to see it extended, so that everybody knows about local planning application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise with and understand what my hon. Friend is getting at, but this is a radical departure. In disagreeing with the Clause I make the point that if the ecclesiastical authority responsible for any building in respect of which a conservation area has been designated is to have the right to appeal against any decision of the local planning authority to grant planning permission, anyone else in that area should have the same right. I do not see why the ecclesiastical authority should have this privilege. I should be interested to know what my hon. Friend thinks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend must accept that this is the Historic Churches Preservation Bill. We are dealing with the protection of historic churches, and it is entirely right and proper in this context that they should have been written into the Bill in this way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that point,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
but I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to consider whether, instead of radically departing from the town planning principle, measures could be introduced to ensure wider knowledge, so that there was more public participation in all planning matters. Initially the local planning authority must make a decision, and we cannot expect it always to make decisions with which we agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very much in sympathy with the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Handsworth (Mr. Sydney Chapman). First, as regards the generality of notification of planning of development sites, particularly in terms of the Clause, this seeks to bring into the Bill two fairly novel concepts. It would give ecclesiastical authorities far wider rights in respect of planning permissions granted than any other body in a similar position. It is an entirely new concept, and it needs elaborating and justifying in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second new concept, touched on already by my hon. Friend, is that if it is thought desirable that third parties should have the right to appeal against a grant of planning permissionâ€”it is a grant of planning permission that we are talking aboutâ€”it should be considered as a whole rather than in this piecemeal fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I am right in saying that there is no other case of an appeal against a planning permission being granted. Similarly, in trying to follow the mechanics of what is implied by the Clause, planning permission would presumably be provisional for a given period, say, a month, until the opportunity for objection had expired. Thus, there is a period of delay even if these concepts are accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, in the case of an appeal the development would be delayed further, and on present form the time for a decision of the local planning authority and determination of any ensuing appeal is about one year. I think that factual questions arise and, transcendentally, two entirely new concepts must be faced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not see why the Minister should be able to object to a planning permission that affects him while Mr. Smith cannot object to a planning permission that affects him. In principle, the two situations are exactly the same,
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
and a right of appeal must be allowed generally if it is allowed at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is also a practical defect in that at the moment there is a possibility of planning permission that has been granted being reversed laterâ€”if the Minister calls in the decision and reverses it. But in such circumstances the local planning authority may be called upon to make compensation in respect of the permission that was granted. Nothing in the Clause indicates what would happen to any planning permission granted which is then the subject of an appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I submit that in those circumstances, where compensation is forthcoming the parties are placed in the original situation and that, in effect, this is unique in permitting an appeal against permission being granted, the consequences not being spelled out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the consequences are not spelled out in the Clause. Two possibilities could arise. One interpretation could be that there has been no decision until the final appeal has been resolved; in this case there is no property right in the permission. The second is that there is property right which is subject to revocation on appeal, in which case compensation would have to be paid. A proviso would have to be made to the Clause to allow for that situation. No doubt, that could be overcome by an Amendment to the Clause, but it illustrates the difficulty of introducing this kind of appeal, of which I am sure the Minister is aware.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully accept much of what the hon. Gentleman says. However, I do not necessarily accept his equation of the position of Mr. Smith with the position of York Minster. We are here debating what are, by common consent, some of the most important and valuable parts of our heritage, and they deserve a particular and special treatment. For that reason one would like them to be in a better position to safeguard their own environs than they are at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's intentions in the Bill, but it is difficult to introduce for ecclesiastical authorities a right of appeal which is not available to the ordinary man in the street in respect of planning, which matters just as much to him, per-

	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
haps more, than a planning application in relation to an historic church. There would be difficulties in allowing for churches such appeals which were not available to the public at large.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all, much greater publicity is given to a planning application in respect of an area around a cathedral church or a grade A building than is given to a planning application for a garage or something like that in a local suburban street. When discussing informing a third party of the dangers to his environment, we should remember that the dangers are much greater for the unsophisticated suburbanite than for the ecclesiastical authority. Therefore, I cannot agree with the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Clause seeks to provide for a third party right of appeal by the ecclesiastical authority responsible for any building in respect of which a conservation area has been designated under Clause 1 of the Bill, against any decision of a local planning authority to grant planning permission for any building, works or development within the area. Such a right of appeal has been resisted on a number of occasions in the past as imposing unwarrantable obstacles to development. Clearly, it would be wrong for development to be put into suspense again while the third party objections are considered after the grant of a planning permission. The time for objections is while an application is still being considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, to give such a right to the Churches alone would be unjustified, especially as they are exempt from listed building control under Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1971. to which other owners are subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham. Handsworth (Mr. Sydney Chapman) expressed strong reservations about the Clause and commented upon the general planning implications. My hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) also expressed strong reservations and suggested that the matter should be considered as a whole, rather than within the range of the specialised matters we are discussing this morning. In that view he was supported by the hon. Member for York (Mr. Alexander W. Lyon). My hon. Friend the Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) will have noted these remarks, and I am sure that he will understand and agree when I
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
ask hon. Gentlemen on both sides of the Committee to agree that the Clause, as drawn, should not stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to detain the Committee on this Clause, because of the vital importance of Clause 3. Suffice it to say that we had an opportunity to discuss, albeit briefly, some very important matters. I am sure that all Members of the Committee are in sympathy with the general underlying objectives of the Clause, and I hope that that will persuade my hon. Friend to consider the matter further and decide who should have the right to object and when.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The one thing that has persuaded me to put this in the Bill, and obviously has persuaded other Members of the Committee that there is something in the general principle, is the fact that there have been so many ghastly errors in the past and so much destruction of real beauty by unthinking planning development. About that there can be no disagreement at all, and because it has happened in the past it is vital that no Government should adopt anything approaching an attitude of complacency, or believe that the situation, as it exists, is entirely right.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to the heart of the Bill. The Clause is exploratory but none the less important. It is the first time for many years that the House has had an opportunity, either in Committee or on the Floor of the House, to debate this tremendously important subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall set the scene for my remarks by referring to a letter which I received last year, soon after first seeking to introduce a Bill of this nature, from The Cathedrals Advisory Committee. The letter pledged support for the Bill and contained the following very important paragraph:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is our view that, although belonging to the Churches (and, by a stroke of history, the preponderance of architecturally distinguished churches are in the custodianship of the Church of England), the cathedrals and parish churches belong in a true and vital sense to the whole local and national communities: they belong to the local community first of all because that is where they play their part as key elements in town and country environments, and they belong to the Nation as part of our common cultural and historical inheritance. They are microcosms of our way of life, as exemplified in its religious aspect and impinging upon many others, and it is often primarily to visit these buildings that so many visitors from overseas come to this country".</p></blockquote>
At the same time, I noticed a leader in 	<i>The Times</i> which pointed out that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In France the State owns the Cathedrals and the communes the lesser churches. In most continental countries state grants are payable for the maintenance of the fabric of churches of historical importance. In Scotland two cathedrals are the property of the Crown and one of a local authority. In England the preservation of the architectural is a matter of intensifying public concern, the value of public
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
funds made available for the purpose has grown and will go on growing, and in the cathedrals and parish churches of England there is an historical record and architectural patrimony unequalled in the world".</p></blockquote>
That letter, and that brief extract from 	<i>The Times</i> leader, set the scene for what I hope will be a lively and wide-ranging debate on this important Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to emphasise that the provisions of the Clause extend to religious buildings of all denominations, but, of necessity, it is the great mediaeval treasures of the Established Church that are at the centre of the problem. Without doubt, they constitute the finest group of historic buildings in the country. They are a priceless part of the nation's heritage and, because of this, they deserve to be jealously guarded and meticulously maintained whatever the cost may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to emphasise that although these churches are nearly always lovingly cared for, no congregation, however devoted, can control the ravages of industrial pollution, any more than they can control the encroachment of the avaricious or philistine developers, to whom we have already referred this morning; nor can a dwindling group of worshippers in a changing countryside or in uninhabited town centres always be expected to meet the enormous cost of repairs which inevitably follow the wear and use of centuries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the Clause attempts to meet the problem of finance. I wish that it could place a statutory obligation upon the Government to contribute. After all, the principle of giving aid to historic buildings, even to churches, if they are redundant, has been established, and it is only the continuance of the ecclesiastical exemption of 1913, the reluctance on the part of Church and State to devise a formula to overcome this, that has prevented something being done in the past. It has always seemed to me to be a trifle quaint that an Established Church and its secular guardian has been unwilling to contemplate the sort of solutions which we all believe to be necessary, and that is why I am glad that discussions are now going on between the Church of England and the Department of the Environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a Private Member, of course, I cannot stray into the realms of Government finance; it is one of the absurdities, one might say, of the House that a Private Member can dispose of the funds
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0428">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
of local authorities from Land's End to John O' Groats cannot dispose of a halfpenny from the central Exchequer. Perhaps something could be done to alter this ridiculous situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why the Bill concentrates on the local authorities, and, again, that is why I have to acknowledge that the Bill is deficient. However, without the Bill we could not have had the debate, and I hope that all hon. Members present will agree that the debate itself is valuable; indeed, their very presence ensures this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Clause would oblige local authorities to use the powers they already have under the Local Authorities (Historic Buildings) Act, 1962, to make grants to any important religious building in their areas irrespective of denomination. I must underline and emphasise that, in view of what was said earlier this morning. However, there is an important proviso that the Historic Buildings Council and the Historic Churches Preservation Trust have to judge that the repairs or restoration are essential and that they are beyond the means of the congregation to provide for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps at this point I should answer the question raised earlier by the hon. Member for Acton (Mr. Spearing). In part it has been answered, so far as the Historic Buildings Council is concerned, by my hon. Friend the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Historic Churches Preservation Trust was set up 20 years ago, with the Archbishop of Canterbury as its head and the Duke of Grafton as Chairman of its Executive Committee, and it has been responsible for raising some Â£2 million for the repair and maintenance of historic churchesâ€”again, without any reference to denomination. It has helped to repair distinguished Roman Catholic churches and Nonconformist chapels as well as those of the Established Church of England. However, as we have said that the churches of the Established Church are inevitably at the heart of this matter, most of the funds have gone to them. It is because that trust, over 20 years, has shown such remarkable wisdom and remarkable success that I wrote it into the Bill as being the body with the best claim to be consulted in matters of this nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I believe that conditions are absolutely crucial if one is disposing of funds, be they central or local. I speak as a practising Christian and a churchgoer, and it is no part of my intention that
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
we should provide a cushion for a negligent incumbent or for lazy worshippers, or that we should stifle the voluntary appeal. Still less am I casting any doubt or aspersion on the valuable work over 20 years of the Historic Churches Preservation Trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the stark fact remains that, while most of our important religious buildings are well cared for, and while our great cathedrals can generally succeed in raising vast sums through public appeal, hundreds of our finest churches stand in danger because population movements away from small villages or from town centres have left them without large congregations to support their absolute needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not talking of the redundant church, because there are many churches, particularly in Suffolk, which is well represented here this morning, and in other parts of East Anglia, where there is a small but devoted band of worshippers for whom the church is the centre of their lives but who cannot in any circumstances be expected to raise the vast sums which are sometimes needed to sustain the fabrics. Indeed, the same applies to my own native Lincolnshire, and to every county in the country to a greater or lesser degree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is nationwide; although these counties to which we have referred always spring to my mind when we are talking of churches, as do the names of York and Norwich, and although we hear of St. Margaret's, Westminster, and its great financial problems, nevertheless the problem is nationwide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The simple, brutal fact is that today there are many hundreds, if not thousands, of churches which are in peril. It is an absolute scandal, for the tourist as well as for the worshipper, that so many should be reduced to selling their treasures to repair their roofs. We should not forget that these churches are very often among our foremost tourist attractions. Even where they are centres and places of pilgrimage, they form focal points in a townscape or landscape, and they convey to the tourist the essence of England. Tourism is bringing into this country over Â£500 million a year. Is it not right that public funds should supply a little to make sure that these churches carry on, even at the lowest level, as tourist magnets of attraction?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I write into the Clauseâ€”and it is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0429">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
appropriate to refer to it at this pointâ€”that the need for vast sums of money for repairs is often occasioned through no fault of the churches. One thinks in terms of atmospheric pollution; of traffic vibration; one may also think of supersonic aircraft flying overhead. One could not place any responsibility for that upon local authorities but one should at least refer to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that this is an imperfect way of tackling the problem. I hope I will not be thought guilty of getting people into Committee under false pretences when I say this about the Bill for which I am responsible. It seems to me absolutely essential that Parliament, and particularly the Government, should be able publicly to proclaim their concern. After all, we are paying lip service day in and day out to "conservation of the environment" and all these "in" words. If we really mean what we say, and if we wish to express a proper and a continuing concern for our environment and for the heritage which is Britain, we must talk about these things and seek, through discussion and debate, to propound sensible and proper solutions to the problems that confront us. I introduced the Clause with those words, and I hope we shall have the opportunity for a fairly wide-ranging debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having regard to the time, it might be helpful to the Committee if I were to intervene to explain the point that we reached in the discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal of thought is being given by the Government and others concerned to the most effective way in which we can achieve the preservation of historic churches. There are many complex and long-standing problems to be solved, but the Government are approaching the question of historic churches with appreciation and great sympathy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Local Authorities (Historic Buildings) Act, 1962, gives local authorities power, but not a duty, to make grants and loans for the repair of historic buildings, and a number of authorities have used this power to assist in the repair of churches. The Government have never sought power to direct local authorities, as suggested by the Clause, to make grants for secular listed buildings, which are subject to control over demolition or
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
alteration under Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1971. This has always been regarded as a matter within the discretion of the directly-elected local authorities, who are responsible for stewardship of the money raised from their ratepayers. They have been encouraged, sometimes persuaded, to give more generously, but the decision has always been regarded as theirs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would seem illogical to depart from this principle as regards ecclesiastical buildings which are not subject to control over their preservation or demolition. Grants have been given by local authorities for such buildings, but there is a difference between a grant voluntarily given and a direction from the central Government to give such a grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this stage, it may help the Committee if I say something about the general question of Government aid for historic churches in use. There is no statutory bar on Exchequer aid for such buildings, and if they are of outstanding historic or architectural interest they would, without changing the statutes, be eligible, like other outstanding buildings, for grants under the Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments Act, 1953. Nevertheless, outstanding churches in use have been excluded by successive Governments from benefit from those grant provisions. The main reason is thatâ€”largely at the Church of England's own insistenceâ€”churches in use, as such, have been excluded since 1913 from successive legislative controls in respect of material alterations to, or demolition of, secular historic structures This Government, like their predecessors, have always expressed their willingness to consider with an open mind any approach made by the Church authorities regarding the possibility of grants towards the cost of repairs to churches which are in use for ecclesiastical purposes. The General Synod of the Church of England has set up a working party with instructions to resume discussions with my Department on the question of grant aid for churches in use, and this is not confined to those of the Church of England; the working party is in close touch with the Church's main committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Preliminary meetings have taken place at officer level with the General Synod and its working party, which is at present collecting informationâ€”Members of the Committee will be very pleased to hear thisâ€”based on the quinquennial inspec-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0430">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
tions, on the estimated cost of repairs to churches in a sample dioceseâ€”Lincolnâ€”and also to study the resources available to meet this, together with details of past expenditure on such works. The Department is collaborating in guiding this study which it is hoped will provide a basis on which the Government can decide how to organise subsequent discussions upon preservation problems and policies with the representatives of the Synod. So preparations are made for detailed discussions with the Synod, and I feel that hon. Gentlemen on both sides of the Committee will be pleased to know that this progress is being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Church authorities in Scotland have approached the Scottish Development Department on the question of grant aid for churches in that country, and discussions are in progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any decision on the provision of funds for grants for the repair of ecclesiastical buildings will have to be taken in the light of all the factors involved, including the ecclesiastical exemption from listed building control and the related question of churches that may be declared redundant under the terms of the Pastoral Measure, 1968.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of these discussions and the study that is proceeding, I feel that to take steps now to direct local authorities to make grants and loans for the repair of historic churches, before the subject of grant aid from Government funds has been fully examined in discussion with the church authorities in the way I have described, would be premature and unsound.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will note with great care any further points that are made by Members of the Committee, but it would not be possible for me to go further than the statement that I have just made. There is an encouraging prospect in view, and in the light of the remarks that I have had to make about the specific terms of the Clause, I would again ask hon. Members, after they have expressed their views upon the general subject, to agree that the Clause should be resisted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worsley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to follow my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary because he has made a very sympathetic and helpful statement. My hon. Friend the Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) described the Clause as an imperfect way of tackling the problem. We understand that. We know what we are talking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
This is State aid for churches in use. My hon. Friend does not want to direct local authorities in this way; nor do we.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It so happens that I have had a certain amount of experience with this problem. I will not speak about my own Parliamentary constituency, but if the hon. Member for York (Mr. Alexander W. Lyon) will forgive me, I will refer mainly to his. Although living in London I happen to be ecclesiastically York, and to sit on the synod of that diocese rather than of London. I have been involved, as the hon. Gentleman has, in raising money for York Minster and, before that, in handling the problem of churches that had become redundant, or were likely to be made redundant, in that city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the marvellously encouraging things about York Minster has been the response of the local authorities, to which the hon. Gentleman referred. Almost every local authority in the county has put money out for this venture and Â£2 million has been obtained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That great building now needs at least a six figure repair fund annually in order to carry out essential work. It will need that sort of money indefinitely. One must not think in terms of a short, sharp spurt to save the cathedral and then do nothing more. We have overcome an immense crisis in administrative savings, but it is equally true that the need for money continues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagreed with the hon. Gentleman's emphasis. He thought that it would be right for the Government to take over the responsibility for York Minster and other churches. In many countries this happens. I have served on the Council of Europe. Outside the cathedral in the city where the council meets, and at other churches in that marvellous city, one can see notices referring to the equivalent of DOE; in other words, the work is financed by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, my experience suggests that it would be a serious error if the financing were all done by the Government. In the response to the York Minster appeal one saw the enormous respect and affection which the building inspires in Yorkshire. Of the Â£2 million, 80 per cent. was raised in the county. If the responsibility were given to the State none of that response would be forthcoming. It is advantageous that a building can draw on the sources of affection. I think that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0431">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
is better than handing repairs over to State authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, though I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman, what the State should do is help those who help themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have raised the question in the Historic Buildings Council, whose machinery has worked so very well. Since the 1953 Act Grants are given, but in response to people raising money themselves. This brings more resources into the repair of fine buildings than would otherwise be the case. I think that that process involves people. I have the fortune to be associated with the National Trust, and there, again, I am continually struck by the enormous enthusiasm for people who will work, give money and help in every way, to preserve fine buildings. All this voluntary effort would be lost if this were made a purely State responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The living churches should adopt the paying technique which is used by the Historic Buildings Council. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, said that the Council would be too busy to take on this work. I am sorry if that is so, because it has built up enormous respect in the country and has evolved a technique of helping people to help themselves, and I hope that it can be extended to the churches. It is the right body for this work. Moreover, the skill and expertise of my Friend's Department's architects will be most valuable in the ecclesiastical as in the secular fields.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These remarks relate to living churches, not to redundant ones. There is great hope that the Department could actually take over some redundant churches of particular importance, but if we already give money for redundant churches there is an illogical position. We are prepared to wait until a church becomes redundant and then to help it through State funds. A church may become redundant because it no longer has a large enough congregation to provide a sufficient income. It would be better to assist that church to remain a living church by helping it before it becomes redundant and needs these massive sums spent on it. I do not think that a church is as attractive and lively as once it was when it ceases to be a place where active worship takes
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
place. Even purely from the conservationist's point of view, it is desirable to keep a church in use. It is illogical to say that a church can only be assisted by the Government once it has gone out of use. This is why I feel it desirable for State money to be available for churches in use. And, of course, since disrepair gets worse, the sooner the money is available the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that there are many difficulties to be overcome. The Member for York mentioned the speech of the then Archbishop of Canterbury just before the first war. One knows the ecclesiastical objection which flows from this. What encourages me is the obvious desire to overcome these difficulties. In the Churches and in the House there is a feeling that these difficulties ought to be overcome. If the courage of my hon. Friend in bringing the Bill forward has done any good, it is to show that there is a general feeling that these difficulties must be overcome to aid the living churches. This morning we may have taken one major step in that direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to attend the Committee. I am grateful to the hon. Member for inviting me to sit on it. Even though my name does not appear among the names of the sponsors of the Bill, I support the purposes of the Bill. I represent an area rich in English ecclesiastical architecture. Rich as it is, it lacks local resources for preservation and upkeep of these churches. There is an illogicality in what we do. Funds often come from the Government for the preservation of ruined churches. One of the greatest ruined churches in the country is in my constituency, Glastonbury Abbey. The reason the State contribute to its upkeep is that had it not done so, there would be nothing left over after the plundering of the remains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential to require central Government to assist in preservation of ruins in the same way they do for redundant churches. This necessitates overcoming the objections for aiding the living churches. Much thought is being given to what can be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed there is no Government admission of the scale of the resources required. My hon. Friend the Minister said, in evidence of the Government's good will towards historic build-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0432">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
ings, that they have increased from Â£700,000 to Â£lÂ½ m over the past two years the amount available to the Historic Buildings Council. That is admirable as far as it goes, but it is chicken feed in comparison with the problem with which we have to deal. Many parish churches in my constituency alone, when they come up for their quinquennial review of the work required in the next five years, will be faced with bills far in excess of what the local congregation can possibly find. In the parish church of Wells, for example, about Â£30,000 or Â£40,000 is required. That is far in excess of what the congregation can manage to raise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One must remember that the living churches have many other calls on their pockets. We must realise that those who subscribe to the churches subscribe to all the other good causes which are part of their tradition and reason for existence. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Chelsea (Mr. Worsley), my own Member of Parliament, that we must do something now for the living churches and do it generously as balancing the resources which can be raised locally. I absolutely agree with him that it is important to keep the voluntary element, but that will not be enough to balance the scale of money required. I hope the Government will recognise the enormous scale of support needed throughout the country to parish churches. I therefore give my support to what is behind the Bill, if not to the terms in which it is written.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Money</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I warmly welcome the Minister's encouraging and sympathetic words, but, like other Members of the Committee who have spoken, and like the proposer of the Bill, who spoke most forcefully and movingly of the dangers to our ecclesiastical and artistic patrimony. I stress that time is not on our side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, I stress one aspect of the Bill which was touched on by my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack), and that is the dispersal of our ecclesiastical and artistic patrimony in order to keep the roof on and the burglars out. One of the greatest artistic scandals that this country has faced over the last few years has been the dispersal of a vast body of Church plate in order to pay for many of the essential things which congregations need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Chelsea (Mr. Worsley), who
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
is a Second Church Estates Commissioner, can no longer be with us. I should have liked to have said in his presence that I believe that the present faculty system of ecclesiastical jurisdiction is totally inadequate. Over and over again, chancellors are put in the most unfortunate position of having to decide between the spiritual needs of a congregation and the need to maintain possessions which have been part of the artistic tradition of that congregation's church for hundreds of years.

To take one example, it is sad that one has to go to Russia to see any pre-Caroline gold or silver plate of any distinction, because most of the fine existing Elizabethan gold plate was in the gift of Queen Elizabeth I to Boris Godunov, with the exception of that which is in the care of some Oxford and Cambridge colleges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again and again chancellors are put in this unhappy position of having to make up their minds whether or not to give a congregation the opportunity to have a full form of worship in reasonable comfort or whether to sell treasures which should essentially be kept in ecclesiastical hands in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter was highlighted by the unfortunate situation which arose as a result of the death of that great and remarkable man, the late Mr. Walter Wigglesworth, who was Dean of Arches and also chancellor of a number of dioceses. At the time of his death he was involved in trying a faculty case whether a picture was or was not to be sold. Because the proceedings were so drawn out, due to the form of ecclesiastical law, he provided in his will, in an exceptionally generous gesture, that, in the case of his death, the costs for both sides should be paid by his executors, so that they should not fall too heavily upon the parties concerned. It seems to me to be a shatteringly unfortunate state of affairs that congregations should have to have protracted legal proceedings over something which both sides basically deplore.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What every congregation must be concerned with is the spiritual life of the parish, but, at the same time, future generations will bitterly regret, and the country as a whole will totally regret, the dispersal of these kinds of possessions, not only silver, but also pictures and many other objects of great value to the artistic life of this country. Unless we act

	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
now, and act quickly, to preserve the fabric of the churches, these objects are the price we shall pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sydney Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to say briefly how much I agree with my hon. Friend in proposing this Clause, though I am sensitive to the copious points made by my hon. Friend the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sooner or later we as a society must realise that, if we want to keep our architectural heritage, and in particular our ecclesiastical architectural heritage, someone somewhere has to pay for it. I do not suggest necessarily that it should be the Government, nor that it should be paid for exclusively by churchgoers, but we as a society must be prepared to pay for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to take up the point made by the hon. Member for York (Mr. Alexander W. Lyon) about such excellent architectural examples as York Minster. It was a difficult and noble achievement to raise the tremendous amount of money needed to restore that excellent Minster, but the few, well-known places like that can look after themselves. If money is needed for Westminster Abbey, St. Paul's Cathedral or York Minster, it will be forthcoming. There are many other churches which are also important in their own ways to many thousands of people living in different parts of our kingdom, and which cannot win the degree of support York or Westminster can, and we must be prepared to pay for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take up the point made by the hon. Member for York, when he spoke on another Clause, since it is relevant to this, that it is not just the people of York who must be responsible for looking after their churches. Fifty years ago, perhaps, the only people who visited York were those living in the villages round about. Now, thanks to the motor car and the relatively increased prosperity of the nation, we are a mobile nation, and it is the responsibility of us all to look after these fine churches. This applies to the preservation of the beauty of the countryside as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only other point I want to make on the Clause generally is that it ill behoves us to try to judge which is the correct architecture to try to keep in a good state of repair. I have already made the point that we have, relatively, so few bits of old architecture that we should think two or three times before allowing any of it to come down. Beauty, thank
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
goodness, is in the eye of the beholder, and what we may think is beautiful, other people may think is ugly and vice versa. I take the hon. Member for York's point about Bradford Cathedral. One of the greatest monstrosities ever perpetrated on the architectural sceneâ€”I am certainly not making a constituency point, as I shall get into trouble, as you realise, Mr. Gurdenâ€”is St. Chad's Roman Catholic Cathedral in Birmingham. If there were one building in the centre of Birmingham that I could have done without, it is that. Yet, it is historically of interest because it was the first Roman Catholic cathedral to be built in this country since the Reformation. Keble College, Oxford, I think, is a pretty hideous buildingâ€”[Hon. Members: "Shame."]â€”This proves that it is a matter of opinion. In case it is thought that I have a down on Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin for St. Chad's, let me say that one of the most beautiful buildings in this country is the very palace which we are in. Although the grand concept was that of Barry, the details which we enjoy so much are those of Pugin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fashions change, and it is not for us to say which bits of architecture should be kept. That is why I go back to my original point, that whether we are talking about Victorian architecture. Georgian architecture, any Renaissance architecture, or medieval architecture, because we have so few bits of old architecture, we should be prepared to pay for maintaining them. After all, our cousins across the Atlantic, who have a reasonable sense of proportion about these things, are prepared to pay Â£1 million to pull down a not particularly attractive bridge spanning the Thames. I am sure that they got the wrong bridgeâ€”that they thought they were buying ing Tower Bridge. They transported it across the Atlantic and across their continent, and built it in an Arizonian desert. I bet that they will make a profit out of the venture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that it is not beyond the wit of our generation to see that we can look after our architectural heritage. It is because my hon. Friend is trying, modestly, to do just that in this important Clause that I am willing to support him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Several themes have emerged, and the principal ones are the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0434">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
contradiction between the living church and the redundant church, and what I regard as the dichotomy between the laity of the parish preserving the church and the Exchequer or local rate fund carrying the burden and Che size and urgency of the problem. The contradiction and the dichotomy are two sides of the same coin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the redundant churches, I take them to be an indication of the reluctance of the Government of the day, of whatever colour they may have been, to come to grips with the basic problem. Some years ago, in my constituency, I took the view that the worshippersâ€”the laity of the parishâ€”should have the responsibility for their church. My view has substantially changed over the past 10 years, and in particular over the past five years. With the increasing rate of building, the mounting cost of building work, the decline in relative value of endowments, the movement of populace, the decline in numbers or generosity of worshippers, and the desire of our churches, as I see it, to concentrate on things spiritual rather than architecturalâ€”a point which may not be accepted by the churchgoers in the Committeeâ€”all combine to bring matters to crisis, which is approaching at great speed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are particular problems in urban and rural areas. I come from a rural area. From an analysis of the last census, it appears that out of some 490 parish churches in the diocese, no fewer than 218 serve populations of less than 250: 138 serve populations of less than 200; and at least 45, probably nearer 50, serve populations of less than 100. The churches in these tiny parishes, which are often the most unspoilt, unsophisticated, picturesque and atmospheric, are those which are at risk. I am deploying the rural argument; there are obviously equivalent arguments for the urban setting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When, however, I received advice from my bishop that, six months ago, our diocesan secretary estimated that the cost of work in progress or ordered as immediate for the living churches in Suffolkâ€”not the discarded churchesâ€”is a staggering Â£2 million, I was very much seized of the problem, both of its urgency and of the inevitability of its falling upon the shoulders of the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had a running correspondence with a particular clergyman over the
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
years and I have now clearly gone on record with him in support of the principles in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What causes concern with my local authorities is that, although we have a real and pressing problem, the Bill might be dubbed, unless the Minister is more forthcoming, the "Chronically Sick and Disabled Churches Bill". Like the similarly named Act dealing with people, it proclaims an irreproachable principle and then imposes on local authorities duties which are beyond their capacity to perform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already quoted the Â£2 million referred to by the Bishop of St. Edmunds-bury and Ipswich. The Clerk to the West Suffolk County Council writes to me and makes detailed points, applauds the general purpose of the Bill, and says that it has not been the general policy of the county council to make grants or loans for historic buildings. There have been one or two exceptions, where there were unusual circumstances; for example, vibration caused by road traffic. In a county like ours, where there are so many historic churches, it is impossible for their repair and maintenance to be borne locally, either by the local planning authority or the congregation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Bill became law, a substantial Government grant would have to be forthcoming. This brings me to a point of detailâ€”that, as drawn, it is particularly offensive in that it empowers the Secretary of State to spend the local authority's money. The Under-Secretary touched upon this aspect of the matter. I take it that the sponsor of the Bill was forced to draft, devise and submit the Bill in this form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had made it plain that I could do other than talk about local authoriy funds, bu we are all concerned with the broader aspect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that; I simply re-emphasise this because a Bill such as this is read literally by local authority officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point must be made that it will be tragic indeed if any remnants of the Bill which eventually emerge onto the Statute Book were to be dubbed the "Chronically Sick and Disabled Churches Bill". The Government must realise that the problem is one of the greatest magni-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0435">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
tude and the utmost urgency. Whilst I welcome the sympathetic announcement made by the Under-Secretary this morning, I regret that it did not come anywhere near the sense of urgency which I feel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo the last sentiments of the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton). I have heard sympathetic noises made from Government Front Benches before. I have heard sympathetic noises made by this Government about conservation grants. When the last Government went out, they had a recommendation for a 75 per cent. general conservation grant. This Government came in and said that they would consider the matter in the light of the experiences of the four towns, one of which was York. Two years have passed and York still does not know how much money it will get to begin even the first stage of the implementation of the Esher Report. I do not look, therefore, with any great favour upon the Under-Secretary coming to the Committee and making sympathetic noises about giving money for redundant churches. The whole annual outlay of the Historic Buildings Council's grant would not begin to meet the kind of challenge the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge has indicated or even the need of York Minster for annual maintenance. Therefore, we are talking about a range of figures which are way above anything that has ever been contemplated by Government in relation to conservation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth of the matter is that this is perhaps the most important part of conservation, but none the less only a part of the general problem of the conservation of the historic core of this country. Both parties must get down to the task of Government of making a real allocation of resources for doing just that. In my view, this particular aspect of the matter can only be dealt with in the way I indicated earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I only come back to the criticism of it by the hon. Member for Chelsea (Mr. Worsley) because we share a common aim in wanting to preserve the beauty of church life without impeding the freedom of people to worship in any way they choose, and without claiming for the churches any particular right which is not available to other members of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
community who are not churchgoers. It would be wrong for us to do that. However, if the Soviet Union can preserve ancient churches in a way that the original Russion Orthodox Church never could, then we have something to learn from there. There is a real case for saying that if a church is prepared to agree that the building is taken over by the Ministry, and the church pays some contribution to the maintenance costs, as the church's share of running the building, it can then really concentrate on the real job of the churchâ€”not keeping a building open, but keeping the life of the community going. That would be a real advance. I, personally, would prefer that, and I hope that in the course of the negotiations that is considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all, as I have indicated, it takes place with a certain limited number of churches in this country at the moment Glasgow Cathedral is only one. If it can happen there, it can happen elsewhere. I do not subscribe to the view of the hon. Member for Chelsea that that will stifle voluntary initiative. I do not think it will. I think the task of going on as we are is so great that voluntary initiative cannot cope with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, it coped in York, and I am very glad that it did, but remember that York Minster was one of the earlier of the major cathedral appeals which have been made in the last few years, and when it came it seemed unique to claim Â£2 million. Shortly afterwards Westminster Abbey claimed Â£2 million, then St. Paul's claimed Â£3 million. It has now become a regular round for cathedrals to claim huge sums from the public, and whether we can go on expecting the public to subscribe in this way is very doubtful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One must not forget that, for the diversion of funds into this area, there is a stopping up of funds into other areas. At almost the same time that York Minster made its claim, the York Theatre made a claim which was very much less substantialâ€”I think about Â£55,000. It did not get anywhere near it, and that was largely because the people to whom it appealed for funds were the same York people to whom the Minster was appealing to for funds. Naturally, the funds went to the Minster. Therefore, the present position of the theatre is parlous, because it does not have the capital sum wanted to keep it going. This also happened with a num-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0436">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
bar of other charities which were appealing at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, there is a real danger in saying that the job can be tackled by voluntary effort with a little more State help. The real truth of the matter is that these architectural gems are the pride of the community at large; they ought to be paid for by the community at large, with the life of the church going on in them, paid for by the church itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to reply briefly to my hon. Friend and mention some other points, but as there are some formalities which we have to complete before the Committee rises at 1 o'clock I shall make my remarks as brief as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was encouraged by my hon. Friend when he referred to "the encouraging prospect in view".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for York (Mr. Alexander W. Lyon) underlined the unity of this Committee when he said that we share a common aim. There is something to be said for the fact that the Committee has had substantially over its quorum for the last two and a quarter hours at a time in the Session when Members like to get out of this building and when they know that the Bill cannot reach the Statute Book. They came here this morning because they believed that this is a matter of considerable importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall again accede to my hon. Friend's request with regard to this Clause, but the Committee should give the friendliest but firmest warning to the Government. We completely accept what has been said in the spirit in which it was said, and we are grateful for it, but this is an urgent problem. We believe that something has to be done, and it is essential that agreement should be reached between the Churches and the Department as soon as possible. It is not a question of technicalities and how one gets over the exemption or how one does not; it is a question of a prime part of our architectural heritage being in some danger. Members from all parts of the country feel that there is a national responsibility to act as quickly as possible. We haveâ€”and I hope that I say this in the right senseâ€”co-operated this morning. I have not pressed any of the Clauses, and hon. Gentlemen on both sides of the Committee have taken the same line. However, we want real action to flow
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
from the discussions now in train, and we want that action to come quickly, so that there will not be the necessity for future Private Members' legislation on this subject. I accept that it is not really a subject for Private Members' legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sincerely hope, however, that our deliberations this morning will not be reported in the Press and elsewhere as a failure of a particular Private Member's Bill, but rather as a strong indication of Members' concern and support for certain essential principles. The Government, through my hon. Friend the Minister, have indicated that they sympathise and recognise a national and a Government responsibility and want to do something about it. With that, I accede to my hon. Friend's request with regard to this Clause, and hope that our discussions on it will bear fruit fairly soon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
