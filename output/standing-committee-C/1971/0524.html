<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That if the proceedings on the Affiliation Proceedings (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill are not completed at this day's sitting, the Committee do meet on Wednesday, 7th June, 1972, at half-past Ten o'clock.—[<i>Dame Joan Vickers.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
POWERS OF COURT ON HEARING COMPLAINT FOR AFFILIATION ORDER AND ON APPEAL</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Mark Carlisle)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 1, in page 2, line 1, leave out subsection (4) and add:
<br><blockquote><p>The following enactments are hereby repealed:—
<ol>
<li>in section 44(3) of the National Assistance Act 1948 and section 26(2) of the Children Act 1948 the words "in addition to the evidence required to be heard by section 4 of the said Act of 1872;</li>
<li>in section 24(3) of the Ministry of Social Security Act 1966 the words "in addition to the evidence required to be heard by section 4 of the said Act of 1957; and</li>
<li>in section 30(3) of the Maintenance Orders (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1972, paragraph (<i>b</i>) and the word "and" immediately preceding it.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
This is one of a group of Government Amendments, the purpose of which is to make alterations in the Maintenance Orders (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act, 1972, which received the Royal Assent on 23rd March. The purpose of that Act was to enable the United Kingdom to give effect to the 1956 United Nations convention on the recovery abroad of maintenance, and it enables a person abroad to apply for maintenance from a person in England in accordance with the law of England.<br><br>
The law in this country at the moment requires a mother of an illegitimate child to give evidence in person before the court. Clearly, to have retained that re-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
quirement in the Maintenance Orders (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act would have breached the whole purpose of the Act, which allowed a mother to enforce an order in this country. Therefore, Section 30(3,<i>b</i>) of that Act specifically provided that an applicant's written evidence could be given before the court and that it would be treated as if it had been given by her in person, thus avoiding the effect of Section 4 of the Affiliation Proceedings Act, 1957.<br><br>
The whole purpose of the Bill is to remove Section 4 of the Affiliation Proceedings Act, 1957, so that in future an order may be made in our courts without the mother giving oral evidence. Therefore, the provisions of Section 30 of the Maintenance Orders (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act, 1972, will become unnecessary. The effect of the Amendment, by adding the new paragraph (<i>c</i>) to subsection (4) of the Clause, is to delete that provision from the 1972 Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dame Joan Vickers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. and learned Friend for moving the Amendment, and I am pleased to accept it.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed</i>, That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dame Joan Vickers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You kindly agreed, Miss Quennell, as the Bill had not had a Second Reading debate, that I might say a few words about its principles.<br><br>
First, I wish to thank the hon. and learned Gentleman for the help that he and his Department have given me. It is a rather small Bill because I was thirteenth on the list and thought that I could not bring in the major Bill that I should have wished to introduce to deal with the guardianship of children.<br><br>
The purpose of the Bill is humane: to stop discrimination against a small section of the population, namely, mothers of illegitimate children. By repealing Section 4(1) of the Affiliation Proceedings Act, 1957, the Bill will eliminate the need for the mother of an illegitimate child to give evidence in person in affiliation proceedings, unless the case is defended.<br><br>
Secondly, it will extend from one to three years from the date of the child's birth the time in which the mother may initiate affiliation proceedings. This will make her equal to the mother who re-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0317">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
quires maintenance for a child. At present the State has the longer period—up to three years if the child is receiving assistance—in which to take this action.<br><br>
Thirdly, at the discretion of the court, it will make the proceedings for the revival, variation or revocation of an affiliation order domestic court proceedings for the purpose of the Magistrates' Courts Act, 1952. The Bill brings these proceedings into line with similar proceedings relating to matrimonial orders and it will restrict the publicity and exclude the general public, which is highly desirable in this type of case.<br><br>
The Affiliation Proceedings Act, 1959, consolidated the law in respect of illegitimate children. It is interesting to observe that provisions of this sort have been in existence ever since the time of Queen Elizabeth I. They were followed by the Poor Law (Amendment) Acts, 1834 and 1844, consolidated by the Bastardy (Amendment) Act, 1872.<br><br>
For many years, there has been a strong element of criminal law in affiliation law. Until the Bill is passed, the mother of an illegitimate child will still be at a disadvantage compared with the mother of a legitimate child. However, medical advances, for example, the availability of blood tests, had now almost entirely eliminated blackmail.<br><br>
Let me give some examples. At present, the mother must give evidence in person. That rule rests upon the words in Section 4(1) of the Affiliation Proceedings Act, 1957:
<br><blockquote><p>"… the court shall hear the evidence of the mother (notwithstanding any consent or admission on the part of the defendant) and such other evidence as she may produce …".</p></blockquote>
Sometimes the mother has died and so the complaint cannot be made for it has been held that the magistrates have no jurisdiction to make an order in such a case. That may help the hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) with some of the issues that he wishes to raise.<br><br>
The absolute rule can cause hardship and may cause unnecessary difficulty to the mother. If the mother, having made a complaint, becomes seriously ill or temporarily of unsound mind, the substance of the complaint may be uncontested for the man alleged to be the father may be willing to admit paternity. It has been suggested to me that in as many as 75 per cent. of affiliation cases the issue of the paternity is not contested which makes
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
it easier for the mother. In the 25 per cent. of cases where the defendant is not prepared to admit paternity, it seems unnecessary to require the mother to be present in court to give evidence.<br><br>
With those few words outlining the purpose of the Bill, I hope that it will meet with the Committee's approval.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leo Abse</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee is indebted to the hon. Lady the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Dame Joan Vickers) for her synoptic explanation, which was particularly necessary as the Bill had not had a Second Reading. She must feel particularly fulfilled, for she has so frequently suggested some of the changes which have been embodied in the Bill. On some occasions I have worked with her. The great difficulty has been that every change affecting affiliation orders has been made in a piecemeal manner.<br><br>
When dusting my old files last evening, I was interested to see all the arguments advanced by the Home Office years ago against what the Lady is now suggesting—that there should be an extension of time for the application to be made. I was exceedingly interested in the ingenious arguments persistently presented by the Home Office over many years. I am grateful that at last Ministers have yielded to the suggestions of the hon. Lady.<br><br>
I am concerned that when we now at last have the opportunity of dealing with affiliation summonses that we should not again leave out matters such as those left out from the Maintenance Orders Act, 1968, which was introduced by the present Lord Chancellor as a Private Member's Bill. I hope that matters which could be dealt with within a Bill such as this will not once again be left out.<br><br>
I shall not anticipate the new Clauses in my name. However, the hon. Lady has explained the facilities now open to a mother. I hope that it will be made clear that it will be possible for a summons to be taken out and an application to be made not only in the case she instanced, when the mother has died, but when the mother has disappeared. If the mother has disappeared completely and the child is left with an aunt or grandmother and no legal order of custody has been given, the Bill will not cover that not infrequent contingency. This is a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0318">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
point which is very much in mind and I hope to deal with it when we come to the new Clauses.<br><br>
Similarly, it is important that we recognise the point made by the hon. Lady the Member for Devonport that under the Bill matters will come in the form of domestic proceedings, therefore enabling the court to sit in private. The purpose of my new Clause is to make it clear that we are preventing for ever the humiliating position by which a woman, having obtained an affiliation order in private, will find when she comes to make a variation that an insensitive court will have the case taken in open court. As I understand the Bill—and this is the reason for my new Clause—there is a discretion left to the court to decide whether such a matter will be taken in private. Regrettably, it is the insensitive court—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I trust that the hon. Member will not anticipate parts of the Bill which are not currently before the Committee.</span></p>
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Abse</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged, Miss Quennell. I assure you that I shall not trespass. I was merely trying to give an intimation, since I had been discourteous enough to put these new clauses down at the last moment, to the Minister and, doubtless, to his officials, of their purpose.<br><br>
I am certain that there is much good in Clause 1 and that a small number of people to whom injustice has been done in the past will be considerably helped.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I first welcome the Bill and congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Dame Joan Vickers) on having introduced it? She said that it was not a matter of the greatest moment, but it is a useful Bill which rectifies, not perhaps an anomaly in the law, but a provision which from time to time caused injustice. It is in keeping with the hon. Lady's record of persistent advocacy of the interests of women, mothers and children that she should have chosen to bring the Bill forward.<br><br>
The hon Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) said that he was glad that the Home Office, which, he felt, had usually been somewhat difficult and obstinate in these matters, was prepared to welcome the Bill. May I add a personal point of view? I am particularly glad to be the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
Minister who is able to welcome the Bill and to say to the hon. Gentleman that at least in part—I take no more credit than that—the change of heart of the Home Office may be due to the fact that this provision appeared as one of the recommendations of a committee, on which I served under Mr. Anthony Cripps, Q.C., on the effect of various provisions of the law as it discriminated against women. We said in our report that, although this provision did not discriminate so much against women as against men, nevertheless it seemed an anomaly that, for example, the Supplementary Benefits Commission should have three years within which to bring an application for affiliation proceedings, whereas the mother of the child should normally have only one year from the date of birth of the child.<br><br>
I am glad that that recommendation, which we made in the pamphlet that we produced before the last election, has been taken up by the hon. Lady in the Bill.<br><br>
Without attempting to interfere with what my hon. Friend has said, perhaps I should formally confirm—and this is the understanding of the Home Office—that Clause 1 has one effect, namely to remove the provision in the Affiliation Proceedings Act, 1957, under which a court could not make an order for the maintenance of an illegitimate child unless the mother of that child appeared in person and gave oral evidence and that evidence was corroborated.<br><br>
The effect of the Clause is that the court will be able to make such an order without the mother giving evidence when there is other evidence on which that order can be based.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend said, it is estimated that about 75 per cent. of affiliation proceedings are contested, not on the issue of paternity, but only on the amount of the order. In cases where an admission of paternity is made on behalf of the father of the child, in future the court will be able to act on that admission without the mother having to go through what must be the somewhat traumatic experience of having to give evidence before the court. It will meet the case where the mother has died; it will meet the case where the mother is ill and unable to give evidence.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Pontypool is quite right: the Bill does not change the need that the complaint must be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0319">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
made by the mother and, therefore, it does not cover the case where the mother has disappeared and left the child with somebody else. I accept the point made by the hon. Gentleman that we should again consider whether the order should be looked upon as one made in the name of the child rather than in the name of the mother. But this raises wider considerations, and I understand that the Law Commission will be covering this aspect within its review of domestic law. Again, I congratulate my hon. Friend on introducing the Bill. The removal of the necessity always to have the mother's evidence corroborated by other evidence, and replacing it with the requirement in other civil cases that the case must be proved to the satisfaction of the court, regardless of whether the mother gives evidence, will bring justice in the few occasional cases where the provisions of the 1957 Act have wrought injustice in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. E. S. Bishop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is with great pleasure that, as one of its putative fathers, I welcome the Bill. The hon. Lady the Member for Plymouth, Devon-port (Dame Joan Vickers) is the mother. I am glad that once again the Minister, a few weeks after the Polygamous Marriages Bill, has smiled benignly on a Private Member's Bill without which we cannot proceed. The Bill, although small, is very important because I understand that only about 14 per cent. of illegitimate children are involved in affiliation orders which amount over recent years to fewer than 10,000.<br><br>
Those of us who sit in the domestic courts and hear these cases from time to time realise the problems facing women in this situation. The period of extension from one to three years is most welcome because it gives the mother, and possibly the putative father, a longer period to think about the question of marriage, adoption and alternatives. It also brings the law into line in relation to the Supplementary Benefits Commission and the Social Security Act, 1966, under which proceedings can be brought within three years.<br><br>
It should be said that the Bill did have a Second Reading, albeit a formal one. I believe my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) suggested it had not. This was one of the benefits
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
on the day on which the anti-discrimination Bill of my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) led to a scene in the Chamber, and I was pleased that the hon. Lady was able to get her Bill through on the nod. But, as it did not have a Second Reading debate, the hon. Lady was right to outline it as she did. Fathers are protected by the corroboration rules and the possibility of ordering a blood test under the Family Law Reform Act, 1970, will safeguard them against what might be regarded as frivolous or non-serious claims. So we are concerned with justice for both parties.<br><br>
Like all Private Members' Bills, this Bill needs more comprehensive consideration, and this, as the Minister says, will be done later by the Law Commission and subsequent legislation.<br><br>
It takes the Affiliation Proceedings Act, 1957 a step further. Among other problems that need to be considered at a later date are those of enforcement, legal aid, problems of finding the father, the custody of children and—also an important question—the need for proceedings to be heard before the domestic court, where there is privacy and freedom of speech.<br><br>
I welcome the Bill and hope that we can make good progress so that it quickly reaches the Statute Book.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 2, in page 2, line 15, at end add:
<br><blockquote><p>(2) In section 30(3,<i>a</i>) of the Maintenance Orders (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1972 (payment under the law applied by a court outside the United Kingdom of money towards the maintenance of a child) for the words "twelve months" there shall be substituted the words "three years (or twelve months, in the case of a complaint under the said Act of 1924)".</p></blockquote>
It may be convenient also to discuss Amendment No. 4, which is consequential.<br><br>
The Amendment makes an alteration to Section 30 of the Maintenance Orders (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act, 1972, and is consequential upon Clause 2 of the Bill.<br><br>
As I explained earlier, Part II of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0320">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
Maintenance Orders (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act, 1972—in which the hon. Member for Newark (Mr. Bishop) and I were both involved during its short passage through Committee—gives effect to the 1956 United Nations Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance. In order to do this it enables a person abroad to make an application for maintenance from a person in England in accordance with the law in England. At the moment, to be in accordance with the Affiliation Proceedings Act, 1957, that application had to be made within the time limit provided by that Act, namely, within 12 months of the alleged father's return to England, within one year of the child's birth, or at any time if the alleged father could claim maintenance for the child within one year of its birth.<br><br>
Accordingly, for the purpose of an application under the 1972 Act, the mother with an overseas order is enabled to take proceedings through an affiliation order by providing in Section 30(3,<i>a</i>) of the 1972 Act that the applicant shall be able to meet the time limit specified in the Affiliation Proceedings Act, 1957, if she can prove that the defendant has within 12 months of the birth of the child paid money for its maintenance in pursuance of the requirements of the law applied by a court outside the United Kingdom.<br><br>
Clause 2 extends the time limit in the Affiliation Proceedings Act from 12 months to three years. It therefore becomes necessary to amend Section 30(3,<i>a</i>) of the 1972 Act to refer to the revised time limit. The Bill does not alter the substance of the law of Northern Ireland, and the reference to the twelve months' time limit is therefore retained for applications against men in Northern Ireland.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 3, in page 2, line 32, leave out subsection (3) and add:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
<br><blockquote><p>(3) Section 5(1) of the Legitimacy Act 1959 section 24(8) of the said Act of 1966 and in section 17(3) of the Maintenance Orders (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1972 the words "or section 5 of the Legitimacy Act 1959" are hereby repealed.</p></blockquote>
This Amendment alters Section 17(3) of the Maintenance Orders (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act, 1972, which is consequential upon the repeal, by this Bill, of Section 5(1) of the Legitimacy Act, 1959.<br><br>
Section 17 of the Maintenance Orders (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act, 1972, makes provision for certain proceedings under that Act in magistrates' courts in England and Wales to be domestic proceedings within the meaning of Section 56 of the Magistrates' Courts Act, 1952. Proceedings under the 1972 Act can be taken in respect of the variation and revocation of affiliation orders. Section 5(1) of the Legitimacy Act, 1959, specifically excludes proceedings for the variation and revocation of an affiliation order from those which it describes as "domestic proceedings". However, since Clause 3 repeals Section 5(1) of the Legitimacy Act and, therefore, they can in future be treated as domestic proceedings, there is no longer the necessity to have the reference to that Act in the 1972 Measure.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed</i>, That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Abse</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Since the substance of new Clause No. 1 is, as I think the Minister would agree, related to Clause 3, I wonder whether it is possible for it to be taken now?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) is, I am sure, aware that under the procedure of our Standing Committees, the new Clauses have to be given formal First and Second Readings before they can be debated. It would, therefore, be appropriate if we adopted our normal practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Abse</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged. In that event, perhaps I can draw out of the Minister, when he talks on Clause 3, some of the issues that may or may not necessarily arise later.<br><br>
All the hon. Members here have shown some interest in this matter before and they will be well aware of the need for privacy in delicate matters such as when a woman comes before the court to make
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0321">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
an application for an affiliation order. It therefore seems curious that it is stated, as the Committee will see from Clause 3(2), that it is discretionary whether any variation, revival or revocation of the order is taken in private or in open court. Hon. Members will note that Clause 3(2) provides that the court may, "if it thinks fit", treat the matter as a domestic proceeding.<br><br>
I cannot understand why a discretion of this kind should be left in the hands of the court at all. In domestic proceedings there is no discretion for the matter to be opened. Why, therefore, has it come about that, when an application is to be made by a girl, or a woman, to vary an order because she knows that the man who is the father of the child has, since the making of the original order, become wealthier, or is earning more, she should feel, in any circumstances, at risk; that the court may decide—in the words of the Clause—" if it thinks fit" to open up the issue?<br><br>
I do not want to anticipate my argument on new Clause No. 1. However, I should like at this stage to know why a discretion of this kind has been given. I am content to leave it at that, although having heard the Minister's arguments, I shall no doubt be able to weigh them when we come to the further proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The reason is one which surprised me somewhat when I looked at the wording of the Clause, and it may surprise the hon. Gentleman. It is that it brings it completely into line with the provision for variation in all other domestic proceedings. Clearly, the hon. Gentleman, like myself, has been labouring under the delusion that applications for variation of a maintenance order were automatically domestic proceedings. Apparently, they are not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Abse</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although it is only comparatively recently that I became aware of what the Minister has been aware of, I was not under that impression. When I spoke about domestic proceedings, I was talking about an issue being decided on the substantive matter, not a variation. If it brings it into line, as the Minister says, it brings it into line with what, I am sure he must agree, is a bad practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise if I was being unfair to the hon. Gentleman. As I under-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
stand the position, an application for an affiliation order is a domestic proceeding, but, specifically under Section 5 of the Legitimacy Act, application for a variation of a normal maintenance order may be, at the discretion of the court, and in practice always is, dealt with as a domestic proceeding. There is no mandatory requirement on the court to deal with variation of maintenance order proceedings as domestic proceedings. The wording for variation of maintenance orders is consistent with the wording that we have now used in Clause 3, which provides that:
<br><blockquote><p>"(2) The court before which there fall to be heard any proceedings for the variation of such an order … may, if it thinks fit, order that those proceedings and any other proceedings being heard therewith shall be treated … as domestic proceedings".</p></blockquote>
We have used the words "may, if it thinks fit"—or perhaps I should say that the hon. Lady, with the assistance of the Home Office in drafting the Bill has used the words—because they are in line with the provisions of the law relating to the variation of all other forms of maintenance orders.<br><br>
If we had done what the hon. Gentleman is asking and had said that applications for the variation of such an order or any proceedings should be domestic proceedings, we should have been creating an anomaly. We should have been clearing up the anomaly in the Legitimacy Acts and creating another. We should have been saying that they must be domestic proceedings, whereas the rest of applications for variation of maintenance orders are domestic only at the discretion of the court. The hon. Gentleman's experience is far more varied than mine, but I think he will agree that, inevitably, applications for variation of normal maintenance or guardianship orders are treated as domestic proceedings by the magistrates' courts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Abse</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I discovered that it was not necessary for a variation to be a domestic proceeding inside a domestic court when I found a court where this practice was not being observed. That is how I discovered that it does occur—I hope exceptionally—in domestic proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that it is exceptional. We are right to have drafted the Bill to coincide with provisions for other
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0322">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
forms of maintenance orders, but I accept that this point should be looked at. I will confirm whether it is within the general terms of reference of the Law Commission, which is looking at the matter. I shall invite it to consider whether we ought not to change the law generally as it applies to all forms of variation of maintenance orders and to make them all domestic proceedings mandatorily, as the application originally is, rather than discretionary.<br><br>
Clause 3 is drafted in this way to bring it into line with the existing law affecting other maintenance orders. I take the point that the hon. Gentleman has made about whether a variation of all orders should not be required to be domestic rather than discretionary, and I am quite prepared to look at that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bishop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister consider the matter before Report? It may bring it into line with the law generally, but if the law is bad, it would be a bad precedent. We ought to set an example by creating a good precedent, if necessary, and getting it right on this occasion. It would be helpful if he could have another look at this matter before Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly consider that. I can confirm now that the whole constitution of procedure of courts dealing with family mattters is under consideration by the Law Commission Family Courts Working Party. As the hon. Member for Pontypool has said, to proceed always by piecemeal legislation is not the best way to proceed. I do not want in any way to inhibit the passing of the hon. Lady's Bill. As one of the sponsors of the Bill, the hon. Gentleman should consider whether it would be possible to get the Bill through if it were further amended on Report. However, I am prepared to consult the Law Commission and inquire whether such a provision would be contrary to its work.</span></p>

PROCEEDINGS TO BE HELD IN PRIVATE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><br><blockquote><p>All proceedings for the variation, revocation or revival of an affiliation order shall be held in private.—[<i>Mr. Abse.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Abse</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
We have had a preliminary canter in what the Minister said following our discussions on Clause 3 on the issues raised in the new Clause.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Newark (Mr. Bishop) has drawn attention to the suggestion of the Minister that we should create an anomaly if we were to prevent a woman from being exposed to the humiliation of an open court when applying for a variation. We should be creating an anomaly if we prevented that whilst leaving a woman applying for variation of an order in maintenance proceedings still open to the hazard of having her domestic affairs exposed to the general public. I think that this is a happy anomaly, one which I should have thought hon. Members would have thought highly desirable.<br><br>
With his customary generosity, the Minister has indicated that he is ready to discuss this matter with the Law Commissioners. He moved a little in his second intervention from his first. In the first he told us that those matters were generally under review by the Law Commissioner. He will forgive me if I sound a little cynical or sceptical. I raised this issue in the debate in December, 1967, when this and other matters—including
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0323">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
the time of three years—were discussed.<br><br>
On each occasion the Home Office spokesman told us that the law was under review by the Law Commissioners and on each occasion the detailed attention which the Law Commissioners were giving to the matter was emphasised. The Law Commissioners are the most hardworking and indefatigable group that we can have, as anybody who has had any association with them knows. I am sure that it is not intended, but in practice Ministers tend to suggest that problems which can be dealt with immediately should be postponed in the belief that at some period in the distant future the Law Commissioners will be able to come up with a report. They are only human and they can deal with only a certain amount of work.<br><br>
When the last affiliation Bill—the Maintenance Orders Act—was before the House, we were told that we could do a little, but that we could not do the things now proposed in the Bill. The truth of the matter is that we work piecemeal. Every move forward to prevent discrimination against the illegitimate has taken place piecemeal.<br><br>
In his second intervention the Minister said that he was ready to discuss with the Law Commissioners whether, if the Bill made an alteration that meant that no woman could be exposed to the humiliation of making an application for variation of an affiliation order in open court, they could deal with this issue, without jeopardising the Bill here or in another place. It cannot be regarded as tolerable that a woman should be inhibited from applying for variation because she knows that her affairs will be made totally public. This is an indefatigable position and it should not be perpetuated in any way. It must be a legacy of the traditional punitive attitude towards the unmarried mother that this has ever occurred and that she should find that the whole matter has to be unnecessarily emblazoned abroad.<br><br>
After all, the effect is not only upon the mother. The woman could be applying for a variation of an order when the child is of school age—indeed this is highly probable. The order may have been given originally against the father when he was a young impecunious person, and a small amount might have been ordered. The young man could become
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
a comfortably-off early middle-aged man. She now must apply for variation in open court, and the fact that the child is illegitimate may be made known to the whole town where otherwise it was being masked.<br><br>
I do not believe, and certainly nobody as humane as the Minister could possibly argue, that that is defensible. I am sure that the hon. Member for Devon-port, with her compassion and concern about this problem, shares my belief that this practice must be ended. I would ask the Minister to repeat his undertaking that between now and Report he will concern himself in discussion with the Law Commissioners, if it is not in conflict with anything that they are doing, so that some action may be taken, either on Report or in another place, to put an end to what is clearly an unhappy practice by which women are exposed to this kind of humiliation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to do anything which might cause embarrassment to the hon. Lady in her conduct of the Bill. But if she agrees, it might be helpful if I said something at this stage about this new Clause. Certainly I feel in a very benign mood towards the hon. Lady this morning. I am delighted, particularly in view of what the hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) has said about the history of this Measure, that we have been able to welcome the Bill an assist the hon. Member for Devonport in bringing it forward.<br><br>
There is much in what the hon. Gentleman has said. I am sure that he will appreciate, without my going into details. that the new Clause as drafted is not acceptable. The use of the word "private" would create some difficulty: the normal reference is to "domestic proceedings". The point made by the hon. Gentleman is valid—that here we have provided that the application for an order, the application for the revival of an order or, indeed, for the revocation of an order, are all dealt with as domestic proceedings without publicity attaching, but if it happens to be an application for a variation of an order, the court may think fit to deal with it as a domestic proceeding, although it is not bound to do so.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman says, it means that the mother of an illegitimate child
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0324">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
who at any stage during, presumably, the first 16 years of life of that child, wishes to apply to vary an order in the interest of that child, to take account of the expanding means of the father, may be inhibited from doing so by the fear that the child will be branded in the area as illegitimate when it was not previously known to be so. There must be some force in the hon. Gentleman's argument. The argument against the case made by the hon. Gentleman is that this provision applies to maintenance orders. What the hon. Gentleman is urging on me is the disgraceful idea that I should accept the replacement of one anomaly by another. It seems to me, thinking aloud on my feet, that there are good grounds for arguing that that anomaly should at least be considered on the basis that the danger of publicity of an application to vary in the case of an illegitimate child is likely to be far more damaging to that child than an application to vary on behalf of a legitimate child against a deserted or a separated spouse. I think that the distinction between those matters would be such as to justify replacing the existing anomaly with a further anomaly. I also go so far as to dare to suggest—knowing that it is always dangerous to attempt to be one's own draftsman—that the whole of that might well be achieved by removing the words
<br><blockquote><p>"may, if it thinks fit"</p></blockquote>
in line 28 of Clause 3 and replacing them merely by the word "shall". I am already told that that is far too simple and that it would not have the necessary effect and clearly it will be far more complicated than that.<br><br>
Therefore, all I can say is that I hope that I have given an indication that I am prepared to consider whether this could be done during a later stage. I shall not attempt to draft an Amendment, either to offer to the hon. Lady or hon. Gentleman, or to put down myself, which I thought might risk losing the Bill, as I am sure that that would not be the wish of the Committee. But I must make it clear that I think that I should consult the Law Commission, on the basis that it is looking at this whole issue, to see whether this change would have serious repercussions elsewhere.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman has made a strong
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
case for distinguishing affiliation proceedings from the rest of domestic proceedings. Clearly, we could not deal with the rest of the domestic proceedings' points in this Bill. If the hon. Gentleman is prepared to withdraw the new Clause and what I have said is acceptable to my hon. Friend the sponsor of the Bill, I shall certainly try to see whether what he suggests could be done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dame Joan Vickers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. and learned Friend. I understand the argument of the hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse). If he can make this a stepping stone to further legislation, I shall be happy, but I see the difficulties. Publicity is equally undesirable for a woman who has applied for a maintenance order having been deserted by her husband when the children do not even know but think that the father has gone away for a time. However, if the Member would withdraw his Clause on the assurance by my hon. and learned Friend to consider the matter, I should be grateful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Abse</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to what the Minister has had to say. I shall keep a vigilant eye on the Bill. In the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the new Clause.</span></p>

INTERVIEW BY PROBATION OR OTHER COURT OFFICER</div> <!-- title -->
<p><br><blockquote><p>On the making of a complaint by the mother or at any stage in the hearing in the complaint the court may require a probation or other court officer to interview the complainant of the alleged putative father, or both.—[<i>Mr. Abse.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Abse</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
I think that I express the general view when I say that we do not desire to think of affiliation proceedings as being only punitive proceedings. Anyone who has sat in the domestic courts is well aware how the intervention of the probation officer, often at the instigation of the magistrates, sometimes leads to reconciliation between a husband and wife—this used to be particularly so, but there
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0325">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
is now a less helpful trend. There is no greater reward for those who sit as magistrates than when they find that their efforts have led not to the granting of a maintenance order for a wife, but, through the aid of the probation officer, to a reconciliation.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
In affiliation proceedings, the practice is quite different. Children are born as the result of the activities of a man and a woman. It is necessary to have legislation which corresponds to the needs of unmarried fathers as well as to the needs of unmarried mothers. It is easy when dealing with matters relating to unmarried mothers and their children to forget the father, but births do not take place by immaculate conception. Therefore, it becomes necessary to ask ourselves whether our courts are equipped to do all they can to give a child two parents.<br><br>
No maintenance order is the equivalent of a father, particularly a natural father. As has already been revealed this morning, in 75 per cent. of the affiliation orders that come before the courts paternity is not contested. It is true that a considerable proportion of that 75 per cent. must consist of men who are married and thus unable to marry. However, a fair proportion, from any analysis that I have seen, are single men.<br><br>
I do not want to appear totally un-romantic, but it is not the general practice of men to sleep with women if they do not like them. This means, again from my experience in former days of this type of proceeding, that it is a fact that the unmarried father has been consorting with the girl for a long time: they will have been going around together.<br><br>
One of the most important pieces of evidence that occurs and recurs in adducing proof of the paternity of the man is the fact that not only was he in regular association with the woman over a long period, but when the child was born, he visited the hospital. The father is often turned away by more punitive nurses who are so sympathetically identified with the unmarried mother that they regard the man as someone who should be punished and banished for having put this woman into this terrible position. Nevertheless, the sending of flowers and gifts takes place frequently in cases of this kind and becomes the substance upon which the lawyer is able to make out his case to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
show corroboration of the allegation that the mother had had intercourse with the man.<br><br>
One often sees a pattern in this type of case where there are feelings of some guilt or concern expressed by way of gifts or flowers, or even by sending clothes to the children. The parents of both sides are often lining up. The parents of the girl say the boy is no good because he has seduced her and abandoned his responsibilities; the parents of the boy say that the girl is no good because she allowed him to sleep with her. So one sees these family battles which naturally operate significantly upon immature young men who, faced with the unexpected situation of prematurely becoming fathers, shrink from taking the ultimate responsibility because they are not encouraged to do so. On the contrary, they arc discouraged by the parental group surrounding them.<br><br>
It is important for us to recognise that it is difficult for men to anticipate their own parenthood. Women can and often do so. My own little daughter used to play with her dolls and long before she reached teen age she had anticipated, as it were, her motherhood. However, I do not think that it is the general experience of men that they are able to anticipate their parenthood and understand it until they become fathers.<br><br>
Judging by the reactions of the men who are brought before the courts on issues of this kind, I would say that there are considerable numbers of men who are full of ambivalence and guilt about their reaction in yielding to parental and other pressures not to marry the girl. People may say that they should not be forced to marry, but, judging by the statistics of women who get married while they are pregnant, it is clear that there are large sections of the population who have premarital intercourse and then marry successfully.<br><br>
As matters stand, although in domestic proceedings the court may often actively intervene to bring together the husband and wife, there appear to be no powers to bring together the unmarried father and the mother. I am aware that it is not the practice to use the probation officers in this way. I am aware, too, that some courts believe that they have no power to bring in the probation officer in cases of this kind.<br><br>
Very often, at the start when a complaint
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0326">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
is made, the bringing in of a probation officer to have a confidential discussion with the girl and the putative father could yield a much happier result than the making of an affiliation order. I am persuaded from my experience of years ago that a solution to the problem of the immature unmarried father could be helped forward if he had some social work support which enabled him to get over his first feelings of apprehension and was able to face up to the responsibilities of parenthood.<br><br>
I am anxious, therefore, in moving the Clause to know whether the matter could be looked at to see whether there are any powers to bring in the probation officer in the circumstances I have outlined. If there are, I should like to know whether the courts could be encouraged to use them. Many courts do not believe that they possess them. If there are no such powers, I urge that these powers be introduced.<br><br>
We want to make our courts healing posts rather than punitive agencies. It is with that in view that I put the new Clause before the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to welcome the Bill, but it seems to me that this proposal is relevant to my only anxiety about it. On balance, the Bill could well exert a slightly adverse influence by reducing the supply of babies for adoption. The visit of a probation officer or other officer of the court, but preferably the probation officer, as well as bringing about a reconciliation between the putative father and the unmarried mother, could offer society a slight opportunity to suggest to an unmarried mother who cannot bring up a child satisfactorily that she could consider adoption. At present, she may not be subjected to that sort of influence in any circumstances.<br><br>
Perhaps I should declare an interest. We have adopted a child and we had to wait a considerable time. I understand that the waiting lists today are lengthening severely. Any step that could reduce some of the problems of a child being brought up by an unmarried mother, when immaturity or lack of resources make her quite unsuitable to do so, would be a useful step. I hope that the Minister will be able to consider this proposal from that view, too.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Laurie Pavitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Hardy) has emphasised the importance of my hon. Friend's proposal. He has revealed something of its complexities. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse), that it would be an advantage to have an advisory service.<br><br>
My problem is to know exactly what its effect would be. With the reorganisation of central services, following the Seebohm Report, and with the impact on another aspect of the Marriage Guidance Council, proceedings on affiliation orders are becoming part and parcel of the work of the courts. The problem is how one can give the most effective aid to the right person and decide the right quarter from which it should come. My hon. Friend has made it clear that this kind of advice would be a desirable addition to the Bill.<br><br>
I shall listen with great interest to what the hon. Gentleman says, as I am in favour of the principle of the new Clause. However, it has opened up such a wide scope that I am not certain whether it does what we should like it to do or whether we are not going much further into the whole subject of what one does when members of the community, in need of help for one reason or another, find themselves in the courts where we have to bring forward a whole battery of differing resources to solve their problems. However, I accept the principle and I should like to see it incorporated in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bishop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the comments of my hon. Friends. My wife is a magistrate, as I am, and involved in domestic proceedings, so one becomes well acquainted with some of the problems. One must appreciate that when an application is made for an affiliation order, a girl is often distraught. She may feel that she has failed for some reason.<br><br>
Some people seem to "get off" and not become pregnant, and there are the problems mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) of the tug-of-war between a girl's parents and the boy's parents about who is to blame and so forth. What really matters in all this is the child's interest, and this is too often overlooked.<br><br>
When magistrates get these cases, they are given legal argument by both sides.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0327">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
if the putative father puts in some form of defence. I think that magistrates generally would welcome more background information about the two parties.<br><br>
As I said earlier, a girl has to decide before she applies whether she wants to marry the boy, or whether the child might be adopted, and this is a critical situation for three people, and that includes the child. Although my hon. Friend has taken some of the glamour off Interflora and men have the opportunity of sending fruit, presents and flowers to hospital on these occasions, there is a warning here that the lawyers are looking for signs to help to make their cases more open and shut than they often are. With all these tensions at this stage in a girl's life and also often in a boy's life, the courts would be helped considerably if we had more background or were able to defer a case until we had a report on the situation. The evidence of a probation officer, experienced in these cases, would be of great value. The situation might justify the inclusion of such a safeguard in the Bill.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
We also have to bear in mind that, although magistrates are limited in the amount of punishment they may inflict, in this situation we may order a putative father to pay £2 a week for 16 years, which works out to about £1,600.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Abse</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be much smaller.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bishop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be much smaller. This is an enormous burden for a putative father to bear. I am not saying that it is not always unjustified, but there are all these factors of the penalty, as it is often thought to be, on the boy. Of course, the blame if anything lies on both parties and not merely on one, whether it is a bad girl or a bad boy, as one is often inclined to suggest they are. The help and guidance of the probation officer is essential to the courts and most of all in the interests not only of the two parties, but of the child itself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To my knowledge, an order in favour of a mother on bringing a claim against a putative father was at one stage limited to 30s. a week but, under the Bill introduced by my noble Friend the present Lord Chancellor when a back bench Member during the Lab-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
our Government, there is now no financial limit. The amount that the courts may order is completely unlimited, so the hon. Gentleman's figure of £2 a week could be considerably higher.<br><br>
I must ask the Committee to resist this new Clause, although I am aware of the general feeling of the value of social help of all kinds in such cases. As the hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) said, no specific power is laid down at the moment to enable the courts to make use of the probation service in cases of this kind, although I have little doubt that from time to time courts ask probation officers to see the parties in disputes of this nature, and that much is often done on an informal basis.<br><br>
Equally I believe, however, that a strong case could probably be made for the merit of having some general counselling service available to the courts in all forms of domestic proceedings, including affiliation proceedings. I understand that the Law Commission's working party on matrimonial proceedings in the magistrates' courts has already given some attention to this problem and that the Family Court Working Party will certainly be doing so. I am told that the matrimonial proceedings working party is well aware of the need for adequate counselling service in domestic proceedings generally.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman chided me earlier about the fall back position of every Minister.<br><br>
There are really two: either it is not the appropriate Bill, or that the matter has been referred to a committee, whether the Criminal Law Revision Committee, the Law Commission or whatever it may be. In fairness, the working party on matrimonial proceedings in magistrates' courts began its work only early in 1971, and I understand that its work is well advanced. The family courts working party started work only last August and has already brought out a consultative document, of which the hon. Gentleman and I should receive copies. I hope that it will have certain comments to make about much wider counselling services and powers in domestic proceedings generally.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Abse</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Since this may be a matter that can be dealt with by practice, I wonder whether the views that have been

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
expressed by the Committee could be brought to the attention of the Home Office Law Commissioners' committee considering the question of matrimonial jurisdiction? If our views were put before that committee, the matter could be dealt with more speedily than if it fell into the general problems being dealt with by the long-term review on family courts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall ensure that the hon. Gentleman's comments are brought to the attention of the Law Commission. This probably comes within the terms of reference of its working party on matrimonial proceedings in magistrates' courts, which is a matter of urgency in view of the recent changes in the law of the higher courts on divorce. I gather that its terms of reference include the question of affiliation proceedings.<br><br>
I cannot encourage my hon. Friend to accept this new Clause because the Home Office would be unable to proceed on a Clause of this kind without consultations with such people as the representatives of the probation service and whatever the hon. Gentleman means by "other court officer"—presumably the justices' clerks association—to find out their reaction and assess the likely effect on the workload and matters of that nature. I have noted what has been said and I shall see that it is drawn to the attention of the working party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dame Joan Vickers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. and learned Friend. I am not likely to accept the new Clause as it stands. I do not like the words "other court officer". Recently I attended an interesting conference of justices of the peace in Plymouth and I know that they are aware of the problem.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) did not strengthen his case by talking about flowers. The married man is cither salving his conscience or somebody is willing to look after the woman in any case. On the question of adoption, there is the guardian <i>ad litem</i> who can give a report to the justices. These women arc well looked after under the social services. There are also organisations to help the father. On three occasions I have given lectures on the feelings of the putative father. I have made quite a study of his guilt feelings, and so on. Furthermore, there is now an organisation called Mothers in Action, which is well aware
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
of the difficulties. The new Clause would require another body to interfere almost with the private affairs of the individuals concerned. They come to court, fully cognisant of what they are asking.<br><br>
They have already decided either to keep the child, and therefore want an affiliation order, or to have it adopted. I do not think that, by the time they come to court for the affiliation order, there is any doubt as to what they want to do.<br><br>
I suggest, therefore, that this Clause is unnecessary. If the magistrates have any doubts, they can refer the case to a social worker for counselling. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the Clause. I am not in favour of having more people brought into the lives of those who are going through a difficult and traumatic experience in their marriage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Abse</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The description of my hon. Friend the Member for Newark (Mr. Bishop) of what happens when an application is made by an unmarried mother for a summons to be taken out accords far more with my knowledge than does the idea of somebody who is totally persistent and able to plough on with the determined intention of asking for a summons and pursuing it to the end, as has been implicitly suggested by the hon. Lady the Member for Plymouth, Devon-port (Dame Joan Vickers). I am convinced that a court should have the facilities to give aid.<br><br>
Secondly, the hon. Lady perhaps misunderstood me when she said that I had done her an injustice in talking about flowers. I can assure her that flowers and fruit are sent to unmarried mothers often by unmarried fathers, unknown to the parents concerned. This indicates that there is a need to be able to get through to the parties and to the unmarried father whose feelings need to be interpreted and who needs the aid of fresh insight as the hon. Lady, from her great experience, well knows.<br><br>
However, I have taken into account the Minister's statement and his assurance that the comments that have been made today will be brought to the notice of the working party. I am pleased that its terms of reference appear to make it likely that it has the capacity to concern itself with the issue which has been raised

AMENDMENT OF SECTION 5 OF AFFILIATION PROCEEDINGS ACT 1957</div> <!-- title -->
<p><br><blockquote><p>In section 5(3) of the Affiliation Proceedings Act of 1957 the words "either legally or by any arrangement approved by the court" are hereby repealed.—[<i>Mr. Abse.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Abse</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
The main aim of the Bill is to make the position of the unmarried mother easier by making it unnecessary for her to attend court. The difficulty which we have to meet is that sometimes the woman does not attend the court, not because she has died or is ill, but because she has abandoned her responsibilities. Social workers are well aware how frequently the child of a feckless mother is taken in, usually on a basis which is temporary but becomes permanent, by an aunt, a grandmother or some other relative.<br><br>
In Wales, the readiness, particularly in working class communities, to take in a child in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner is known to those of us who have seen how, years later, problems arise from this practice.<br><br>
Certainly in Wales, which may be typical of other regions, the idea that a child can come into the custody of a relative as the result of the inadequacy or failure of a parent is not rare. A problem in the past has been that a child is left with a grandmother, the mother abandons the child, moves away and is not available, but the child has no support from the father, who may well be able to give it, because there is no process by which the matter can be brought before the court.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
The Minister of State hinted earlier in these proceedings that wider consideration of these matters would perhaps lead to the conclusion—one which the hon. Lady and I urged in past debates—that the right of maintenance should be vested
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
in the child. I accept that that involves a much wider consideration than can be expected to be given if a Bill of this kind is to reach the Statute Book. Without taking the step which should, but cannot be taken, of vesting the right in the child, surely it is possible to do something about this matter within the terms of the Bill.<br><br>
Under Section 5(3) of the parent Act, an affiliation order may, on the application of a person other than the child's mother who for the time being has the custody of the child, be made, provided that that child is in the applicant's custody by way of a legal order. If the child has come into the possession of the person by way of an order of the court, it is open to that person to make an application on behalf of the child and obtain maintenance. It must however, be a legal order and it must be legal custody. I do not believe that it can be taken if the <i>de facto</i> custody is there but is short of an order.<br><br>
Although it has not been mentioned in representations received from the indefatigable secretary of the National Council for the Unmarried Mother and Her Child and which have been circulated to Members, in the past we have received such representations pointing out that it is not possible to obtain an order on behalf of the child when the child is with a grandmother or an aunt after the mother has gone off and has taken no action. If I am wrong, and if the terms of Section 5(3) mean that, in spite of the lack of an order of the court, people who have <i>de facto</i> custody could go to the court for an order providing that they have custody and explaining to the bench the circumstances in which they have custody, then there would be no need for new Clause No. 3. If the National Council for the Unmarried Mother and Her Child and many of us are correct in believing that, in the circumstances I have outlined, there is no protection available to the child in the form of a court order on behalf of a custodian, then there is need for action to be taken.<br><br>
I have put forward the suggestion that the words
<br><blockquote><p>"either legally or by any arrangement approved by the court"</p></blockquote>
should be left out of Section 5(3) of the Affiliation Proceedings Act, 1957. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0330">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
effect of such a repeal would be that people who could prove that they had custody of the child would be able to go to court and make an application rather than only being able to do this if they had obtained a legal order for custody, which I understand is the present position. I put forward the new Clause so that we may have some clarification of the position to see whether it would be practicable to assist the child who finds himself or herself in the position of being an abandoned child in the care of a person who should have the right to obtain some money from the father of the child.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) will forgive me if I am unable to give him a complete answer, since he will appreciate that I have had very little notice of the new Clauses. If I understand the provisions of the Affiliation Proceedings Act, 1957, correctly, I do not think that the purpose of the new Clause would be achieved by the way in which it is drafted.<br><br>
If I understand the position correctly, Section 5(3) of the Affiliation Proceedings Act, 1957, must be read subject to Section 1 of that Act, which requires the mother, the single woman who has been delivered of the illegitimate child, to make the application by complaint. Section 5(3) deals only with those cases in which an affiliation order is already in existence because the mother has made a complaint under Section 1. Section 5(3) of the 1957 Act provides that when there is an affiliation order in existence, then, on the application of a person other than the mother, namely, the person who has the custody of the child, either under a court order or under a scheme agreed by the court, the court may make an order for the payment of the money to that individual or for a variation in the amount due to be paid. But it does not enable that person to make an application standing in the stead of the mother for the affiliation order.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman has raised again the wider question of whether the person who has the custody, either <i>de facto</i> or <i>de jure</i>, of the child should be in a position to institute proceedings on behalf of that child for an order against the putative father. I am told that to enable
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
that to occur it would be necessary to alter Section 1 of the 1957 Act regarding the making of a complaint, and the new Clause does not bite on Section 1 at all.<br><br>
I take the point which the hon. Gentleman makes that Section 5(3) means that people who have <i>de facto</i> custody cannot get the payment of an existing affiliation order made to them unless they have that <i>de facto</i> custody following upon a legal custody order in their favour or by a scheme approved by the court. I am afraid that I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman the basis for that provision. I understand it is of long standing, and we have not had the opportunity of considering what the effect of its removal might be.<br><br>
Therefore, all I can say in answer to the hon. Gentleman is that the Clause would not affect the wider issue of the ability to apply for an affiliation order. On the narrower point of the order being in existence and payment being made to the person who has the <i>de facto</i> custody, even though there is no court order for the custody of the child in existence, I can only say that I shall bear in mind what the hon. Gentleman has said, and if I am advised that this matter should be considered again, then we will consider it. But I cannot go further than to say I shall ask those concerned in the Home Office to study with care what the hon. Gentleman has said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Abse</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged. I realise that, in view of the late stage at which I tabled the Clause, I could not expect a more definitive answer, although the answer has been exceedingly helpful in clarifying some aspects of the matter. On the understanding, intimated by the Minister, that he will consider the matter again, taking into account what I have said, to see whether anything can be done, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Motion.</span></p>
