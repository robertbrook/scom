</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ray Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was on my feet when we concluded the previous Sitting. Since then we have had a Sittings Motion, during which something new was introduced into the consideration of the Bill, namely, the report, an advance copy of which was made available to the Committee by the Minister. I should like to raise a point of order before speaking to the Amendments under discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the fact, Mr. Wallace, that the report and the principles outlined in it so fundamentally alter the Bill's character, would it not be wise to adjourn and consider precisely what form a fresh Bill should take? The Committee and you,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>198</span>
Mr. Wallace, will have noted that no Amendments have been tabled by the Bill's sponsor to take account of the new principles introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I consider that it would be to tht benefit of the Committee, and of greae importance to the Bill, if we could have an adjournment and come back with a Bill which more nearly matches the fresh principles introduced by the Minister's report. This is perhaps not strictly a point of order, but I believe that it will be difficult for us to proceed unless we have a clear statement of intention from the Bill's sponsor about how he will incorporate the new principles. Your guidance in this matter will be of benefit to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point, Mr. Wallace, could you advise whether we are correct? In view of what my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter) has said, and the fact that the two sides of the Committee are much closer than before, I believe that it is within the normal custom and practice for the promoter of the Bill to move a Motion for the adjournment of the Committee. If he did so, at this stage, we in our turn would be prepared to enter into meaningful discussions to seek an agreed basis for proceeding more rapidly with the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am thoroughly seized of the point which the hon. Gentlemen have made. It is true that the statement made by my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and Development the week before the Easter Recess is of material importance, and undoubtedly meets many of the criticisms without weakening the substance of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we have had substantial discussions through the usual channels today about progress on the Bill, and I have myself put down a number of Amendments to try to meet the criticisms. But the time is coming when I should reasonably expect some reciprocal gesture. In view of what the hon. Gentlemen have said, I am prepared to give the matter thought, but it seems most practical to deal with this set of Amendments. We have already discussed them for a whole morning, and one would hope that we would not need to deal with them for much longer. I should then be prepared to consider
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0224">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>199</span>
adjourning the Committee for a period to see whether the usual channels could come to some sensible arrangement, if hon. Gentlemen would feel that to be a satisfactory solution; if not, perhaps they will make some alternative suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Lomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order. May I point out that the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Crouch) and I were absent at the last Sitting. We had agreed to pair, which was quite right, but neither of us, I think, received the extract from the report "Fifty Million Volunteers".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would you consider it right, Mr. Wallace, that, if the Minister decides to circulate members of the Committee with a document, he should circulate all members of the Committee and not those who happen to be present? How can the hon. Member for Canterbury and I hope to discuss the point if we have not received the document in question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not prepared to accept a Motion to adjourn the Committee. The Bill has been read a Second time, and it is the Committee's duty to proceed with its examination. Furthermore, the Bill itself cannot be altered by the Minister's statement. However, members of the Committee may take points arising from the report into consideration during our discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the response from the sponsor of the Bill was rather disappointing. The Minister has moved a great deal in the report, although, admittedly, as he pointed out, there is no suggestion at present that that would substantially alter the content of the Bill. Presumably the report would not have been introduced by the Minister were it not ultimately intended that the principle should find its way into the Bill and therefore fundamentally alter its present character.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the Amendments with which we are at present dealing, it will be extremely difficult to avoid that report. This applies to Amendment No. 59 in particular, which deals with the question of numbers and of hours, and with the way in which we set out to deal with the whole vexed subject of the organisation of pop festivals. In fact, my own Amendment has had other Amendments put to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>200</span>
Amendment No. 59 would now make Clause 1 read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In this Act ' night assembly' means an event for the purpose of which not less than three thousand persons assemble for more than four hours after midnight on two or more consecutive days."</p></blockquote>
That is a considerable change from the Clause as drafted. It deals, first, with numbers, and secondly with any event and not just events held in the open air. It deals with events which should come within the terms of the Bill as they are constructed in terms of hours of performance and so on. It would not cover one-day events, but would cover day-time events.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be impossible for me to deal with these points without in some way referring to the report which the Minister has introduced to us, and which I have read thoroughly two or three times over the past few days. For those reasons alone, I should have thought that the sponsor of the Bill might have been rather more forthcoming. It is evident that both sides of the Committee, following the Minister's intervention, wish to move rapidly to a conclusion, and to produce a Bill with which all, whether inside or outside the Committee, may be satisfied. Even at this stage, one would have hoped that the sponsor would have demonstrated a change of heart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said at our last Sitting, Amendment No. 59 should be taken together with Amendment No. 60, which was anticipated to a large extent by the Minister, when he introduced the concept of a code of practice. I feel that Amendment No. 59 is necessary, because the restrictions imposed by the Bill are at present too tightly drawn. We know that the Bill is directed at pop festivals, although they are not specifically named. Yet many of the problems arising therefrom apply equally to other functions which are attended by similarly large gatherings of people. Because of the stringency of the restrictions, the sponsor has demonstrated his willingness to table Amendments which would enable many organisations to be excluded from the provisions of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should also be borne in mind that the vast majority of events with which the Bill would be concerned are one-day events. Those events, which are historically and traditionally a part of our rural and urban way of life, have caused no difficulties in the past and should not fall within
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>201</span>
the ambit of the Bill. Acceptance of this point would ensure the immediate exclusion from the provisions of the Bill of such gatherings as scouts' meetings, church assemblies, vigils and many other spontaneous events.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point with which my Amendment seeks to deal is the question of numbers. Judging from all that I have read on the subject of numbers, more particularly in the report which the Minister has placed before us, it is evident that there is insufficient information to enable us to form an expert judgment on what constitutes an appropriate number. I have said 3,000, but that is no more than a guess. Other people have tabled Amendments to my Amendment which go up to 50,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Maddan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Someone said "Rubbish". Already there is some conflict about numbers. It might have been the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Woodnutt) who said "Rubbish".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maddan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Maddan).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Maddan) will have an opportunity later in the discussion to substantiate the term, "rubbish".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take my hon. Friend away from the question of numbers to the question of what he means by "days" in his Amendment? If we meet at five minutes to midnight on a hypothetical date, does that five minutes count as a day? Must we then finish by midnight the following night? Would it not be preferable for us to talk in hours? Is the hon. Member talking about 48 hours, when he refers in his Amendment to "two days"? I should be grateful for an explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Life was complicated enough without the hon. Member for Huddersfield, West (Mr. Lomas) dragging in what constitutes a day. It is 24 hours, certainly. It is a point seriously to examine, but I should imagine that if the sponsor of the Bill saw any merit in accepting my Amendment he would want to word it in a better way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Forty-eight hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>202</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Forty-eight hours is a reasonable and highly definitive approach. I should be quite prepared, were the sponsor of the Bill prepared to accept my Amendment, to see such a change incorporated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the questions of days, hours and numbers, all these things must be judged when set against regulations. I am quite sure, judging by my limited experience, that the regulations that one would require for a crowd of 3,000 would not be acceptable for a crowd of 50,000. Indeed, the Minister has already indicated that what we want is flexibility. In his report flexibility seems to be an inherent part of the approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other thing to bear in mind concerning numbers is that 40,000 people gathered for a day-time event could constitute just as great a hazard as 3,500 gathered at night. There does not seem to be any attempt to reconcile the problems and conflicts that arise when we talk about night-time events and, on the other hand, ignore regulations to cover day-time events. That is why, in my Amendment, I have not sought to limit these proposals to a specifically nighttime period. Large day-time meetings could produce problems on a far bigger scale than small night-time meetings. At day-time meetings many children would be present, but it is unlikely that they would be present in great numbers at night.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Unfortunately, we are not dealing with day-time meetings but meetings after midnight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is quite true, Mr. Wallace, but I have not specified the period after midnight in my Amendment. The Bill specifies the first eight hours after midnight, but my Amendment does not specify a certain period after midnight. As drafted it could cover any period in the 24 hours. It may have escaped the notice of the Committee Clerk, but it is quite a different approach from that of the Bill. I have tried to cast the net wide enough to cover both night-time and day-time assemblies. The Amendment covers day-time assemblies. If accepted, it may well provide sufficient justification for changing the Title to "Day and Night Assemblies Bill". I do not know how far we can go along that path. Perhaps we cannot so fundamentally
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0226">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>203</span>
alter the character of the Bill. It is also possible that the Amendment should never have got on the Order Paper at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Bill is the Night Assemblies Bill and is designed to deal with night assemblies. The hon. Gentleman was fortunate in that his Amendment got through the net. If he is going to discuss day-time assemblies he will have to withdraw the Amendment and put down another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wallace. In view of your ruling, could we not have a definition of what "night" means? If we are discussing a Night Assemblies Bill and you then rule out discussion of day-time assemblies I should have thought that it would be incumbent upon you, as Chairman of the Committee, to define what is meant by "night". When does night commence, and when does it end?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chairman is the Chairman, and not Solomon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Wallace. This is a very important point. If we have a Bill called the Night Assemblies Bill and you rule out discussions on day-time assemblies, the sponsor must define what he means by "night"—when it begins, when it ends, and so on. Otherwise, we are in a terrible confusion. I hope that the sponsor will now define the Title of the Bill. If you are ruling out day time, Mr. Wallace, we must know when night commences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order; it is a point of debate. I have my own view of what constitutes night, but I am not prepared to give a ruling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Wallace. Do I understand that we are not now able to discuss what happens at a pop festival or any other assembly before midnight? What happens before midnight can be very relevant to what happens after midnight. If, as I understand it, part of the eight hours takes place before midnight, it is highly relevant to discuss exactly what happens before midnight. I should like an assurance that we can discuss what happens before midnight. If the eight hours or part of the eight hours takes place before midnight, according to your ruling we cannot discuss
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>204</span>
part of that eight hours. That is very relevant to the whole Bill and our attitude to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is discussing what constitutes a night assembly. That is the only point under discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was precisely because of most of the thoughts expressed so far that I constructed the Amendment, with the assistance of the Clerk to the Committee—perhaps I should say "the limited advice of the Committee Clerk", since I do not wish to put him in an invidious position—specifically to avoid the whole question of limiting the period immediately after midnight. The fact that it got on the Order Paper is due entirely to my ignorance and the fact that there was a hole in the net sufficiently wide for it to be able to slip through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment should be seen together with Amendment No. 60, because it is part of a whole—not the hole in the net, but the whole of my approach to the Bill. Going on from that point, I turn my attention to the regulations that will be necessary to deal with the varying size of crowds. My Amendment refers to three thousand, as specified in the Bill, but there is little evidence for us to go on. If we pick a number we are merely picking it out of a hat. In the report that has been given to us a court judgment is listed as being one piece of evidence—and a scanty piece of evidence at that—to decide the number of toilets per thousand that should be made available at a pop concert. There is no evidence, for example, about washing facilities or fire precautions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In going through evidence available from the research section of the House of Commons Library I took some care to try to determine the regulations that are available for the building industry in relation to indoor events. It is difficult to obtain information there that we can use in our deliberations here. If we are not careful we shall impose far higher standards on events held outdoors than are imposed on events and gatherings held indoors. Anyone who has attended football matches or athletics meetings at stadiums will bear witness to the fact that facilities at a stadium with, say, a 30,000 crowd, can be vastly different from those at another stadium with a 50,000 crowd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I prepared this speech before the Minister came forward with his report, and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>205</span>
I had intended to go on to say that this, in itself, was sufficient evidence for the Minister to tell us his thoughts on the way in which we should construct a code which, when we last discussed the matter, was being rebutted vigorously by the sponsor of the Bill. Now this new principle of a code of practice has been introduced into our discussions, but I should like it to be given careful consideration before it is embodied in recommendations to local authorities or legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My Amendment caters for all outside events. I leave aside the question of the definition of "open air", which we have already discovered is either not capable of being interpreted or, if it is, is capable of a wide range of interpretations. When such a difficulty arises it is best to leave it aside altogether. In this case we find that events held in large marquees—which can now accommodate many thousands of people—tents, temporary buildings, and stadiums, all come within the purview either of this Bill or a Bill designed to deal with the problems arising out of large gatherings outside what we know as buildings. I cannot see why a gathering of 5,000, or 10,000, or 15,000 people held in a marquee should not be covered by the same regulations as an event attended by the same number of people held in the open air. If we avoid the question of the definition of "open air" it will remove many difficulties. This is another reason why it would have been helpful to the Committee if we could have adjourned at this stage and discussed the matters—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.0 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman address his mind to the fact that the Amendment concerns numbers—the increase from 1,000 to 3,000 as the lower figure. Regulations, about which the hon. Gentleman has spoken, could deal with different conditions for numbers above 3,000. All that is being done in the Amendment that has been moved is to exclude all gatherings which do not exceed 3,000. Would the hon. Gentleman be prepared to accept that exclusion? At a later stage we might discuss how the regulations should deal with numbers above 3,000?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that entirely, but my Amendment goes far wider than the mere question of numbers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>206</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will allow me to interrupt again. I appreciate that. If the number in the Amendment is accepted, it might be convenient to go on to discuss Amendment No. 59, which seems to be for regulations and which could be discussed with all the regulations which I hope will be introduced later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the Minister says. Nevertheless the Amendment differs quite dramatically from the substance of the Clause. More specifically, it deals with areas and subjects with which regulations could not deal as, for example, the questions of hours after midnight which regulations do not cover. I submit that any event which does not go beyond four hours after midnight will be of such a size as to cause no offence to anyone—local festivals, fetes, gymkhanas, country fairs, car rallies and the spontaneous events that we referred to earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Events which are a traditional historical part of life in the countryside and, to a more limited extent life in our cities, should not be covered by legislation, although I accept that their historical value and the traditional part that they play in the life of the community in no way removes them from the health regulations that we want to impose on more modern gatherings. Country people have found it more than possible in the past to organise events in the best possible way. There seems to be no good reason—certainly none has been offered to the Committee—to convince us that they should now be covered by law. Events held for that limited period after midnight, more particularly one-day events—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has mentioned "after midnight". This is the Night Assemblies Bill. Surely "after midnight" is morning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is. It is a.m. Does my hon. Friend not consider that if the Bill is wrongly titled we have the right to amend not only the Bill's Title but its whole concept. The Bill should go back whence it came, and begin all over again. The Title is obviously wrong. Does not my hon. Friend agree that one minute past midnight is a.m., and not p.m., and does that not make nonsense of the Title of the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what my hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0228">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>207</span>
Friend says, but the Bill defines the period of time after midnight. Although my hon. Friend may be right, that "Night Assemblies" is inappropriate as the Title, the period of time with which the Bill is concerned is closely defined. I do not know how an inaccuracy of a Title affects the legitimacy of a Bill. It would be useful, Mr. Wallace, if you would rule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Crouch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not infrequent for Bills to be retitled. This could come up on Clause 8, where the Title must be endorsed by the Committee. The last Administration presented a Consumer Protection Bill which, after discussion in another place, as accepted in the House, subsequently became the Trade Descriptions Bill. The Committee should not try to split hairs about matters not vital to the content of a Bill which both sides seek to obtain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite correct. Amendments to the Title can be considered when we reach that point, and after the other discussions have taken place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that that is so, Mr. Wallace, although it merely adds to the long cycle of events in the Committee. Every Clause is capable of being changed, and shows every chance of being changed. I should not be at all surprised to find the main Title changed because of inaccuracy, or because the principles originally embodied in the Bill were found to be wholly wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I could get back, Mr. Wallace—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be obliged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —to my point, it was that 99.9 per cent. of outdoor events in the countryside, or in urban communities, are one-day events. As a traditional part of our community life they do not constitute any nuisance whatsoever. A small number of people may find them a minor, but transitional, nuisance, but we all have to put up with some nuisance or another. Town dwellers must put up with filth and dirt as a part of urban living and it is not unreasonable that country dwellers should put up with minor nuisances which last for only a short time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Urban events held at places such as the Oval, or in the Royal Parks, would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>208</span>
escape. The hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Crouch) said that this is not relevant—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crouch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I thought we were debating Clause 1, which is to do with numbers, and not sites. The hon. Member for Birmingham, North-field (Mr. Carter) mentioned the Oval and other places. That has to do with sites.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the hon. Member is wrong. I do not know whether he was here when we discussed it but, in law, events held at the Oval, or Lords, are events held in the open air. It would be wrong to include such places as the Oval and Lords within the purview of the Bill. They are only one-day events. I can see no reason why pop concerts which have been held at the Oval, most successfully, for charity, should now come within the purview of an Act of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all, many thousands of people, over a period of five days, will go to the Oval to watch a cricket match. There are precisely the same facilities there as at any cricket match, and probably greater numbers attend than would attend a pop festival at the same place. No good reason has been proffered during our debates why stadiums like the Oval or any other football or cricket ground should not be subject to the full rigour of the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition—although you may argue that I am out of order here, Mr. Wallace—day-time events, as my Amendment is worded, now come within the purview of either the Bill or an amended Bill should my Amendment be accepted. Logically, I cannot see why massive crowds, 200,000 strong, congregating together in the countryside for one reason or another should entirely escape health and sanitary regulations, while 4,000 people at night are expected to meet very rigorous health standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should a country fair escape the provisions of the Bill, but a pop festival should not? Why should a horse-jumping gymkhana, where many thousands of people attend and require exactly the same form of provision, escape, and yet a Boy Scout rally, which may add up to only a few thousand people in Windsor Great Park, be included?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go on too long on that point, Mr. Wallace, because I accept your
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0229">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>209</span>
ruling that it is probably going much wider than you are prepared to let me go. However, if any merit attaches to my conclusions, are we to believe that different groups of people have different bodily functions? Do those who gather to attend a gymkhana during the day somehow perform differently from those who attend a pop festival at night?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Woodnutt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is not that different people's bodily functions behave in different ways; it is that they are different at night. At a Royal Agricultural Show, or anything lasting throughout the day, the same facilities are not required as are required during the hours of darkness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is completely out of order. We are not discussing bodily functions. We want to get back to the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that bodily functions lay at the heart of our discussion. We are trying to evolve a set of regulations to deal precisely with this human and intimate subject. I cannot see why those who attend a country fair should somehow demand fewer facilities than those who attend, say, an all-night vigil in the countryside in roughly the same numbers. I have heard no suggestion—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is discussing regulations and other matters arising in Amendment No. 60, which he is anticipating. We are not discussing Amendment No. 60 at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I was not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I am loath to intervene in my hon. Friend's interesting speech, but the Committee will recall that we are in a difficulty because the Minister, in what I consider to be an abuse of procedure, intervened in the Sittings Motion debate at our previous sitting with what amounts to a code of practice, namely, the Stevenson Committee report. We are all agreed that the Minister's action affects the rest of the proceedings on the Bill because it impinges on most of the Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall be in great difficulty if we cannot refer to matters which were in order under the Sittings Motion but which, Mr. Wallace, you are not now prepared to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>210</span>
allow when it comes to a back bencher making a speech in contrast to a Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In point of fact, if the hon. Gentleman will refer to the reported proceedings of the previous sitting, he will find that I did not allow the Minister to enlarge on the report. The report can be dealt with as and when appropriate at various stages of the debate on Amendments under discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My references to regulations had nothing whatsoever to do with the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You have indicated, Mr. Wallace, that my Amendment should not perhaps be on the Notice Paper. Nevertheless, it is on the Notice Paper, and I was saying that day-time events which would be included if my Amendment were accepted have precisely the same health requirements as night events. I am not trying to be pedantic or to filibuster, but I believe that if we are to impose standards on people who gather at night we should equally impose the same standards on similar gatherings held in the day time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today we have come to the heart of the matter by the intervention of the hon. Member for Huddersfield, West (Mr. Lomas), who pointed out that night time is incapable of being defined. This is a further indication of the need for us to adjourn at the earliest possible moment to work out a Bill on which all Committee members could be agreed. There are so many inconsistencies, errors and weaknesses in the Bill that we ought to go away, and then come back to the Committee with something about which we more nearly agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of hours, and what is day time and what is not, most sensible people would agree that matters of hygiene and sanitation are 24-hour requirements, not merely requirements to be called for during a period of eight hours after midnight. If my Amendment were accepted, namely, any four hours after midnight, the Bill would be changed to a point where pop festivals would be covered and the same standards would be imposed on events where large numbers of people gather, whether in day time or night time. At some stage in our proceedings the Bill's sponsor should tell us precisely why events held in the first eight hours after midnight are in some way
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0230">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>211</span>
different from those held before midnight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the public wants to see in legislation is consistency. One of the Bill's principal errors is that it has been brought forward and inspired to some extent by fear and prejudice. Irrationality on the part of the sponsor and his supporters was not the motivating force, but had we had a more rational approach to the subject many of the problems we have unearthed would not have arisen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has already indicated that there is a wide gap between himself and the Government on the one hand and the sponsor on the other. I doubt whether the sponsor will accept my Amendment. I am equally sure that were this a wholly Government Bill the Minister would have been prepared, first thing this afternoon, to suggest adjourning to consider the Amendment, with others, and to come back with a Bill to meet the objections and points raised in the Committee and the fears and worries of people outside who have communicated with us in many thousands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment will have gone some way to meet those objections, but I can only repeat my request that the sponsor considers the Amendments and the wish of hon. Members on this side of the Committee to adjourn at the earliest possible moment so that we can deal in a rational manner and climate with the many problems that have arisen since the Minister introduced his report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crouch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with great interest to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter). He was fair to the Committee in not trying to deviate too far from his Amendments. I can understand his difficulty, in that the Bill encourages one to stray away from numbers to questions of site and suitability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problems of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee arise from the fact that the Bill presents some difficulties, because we are all trying to produce good legislation. I do not think that anyone in the Committee seeks to throw the Bill out. There may well be some who do not like the Title, and others who think that the Bill is too restrictive about numbers, hours after midnight and the period about which we are talking. It is the question of delineation and description that worries us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>212</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman get this point clear? No one is against a code of conduct being prepared for pop festivals or assemblies of a given number, but hon. Members on this side of the Committee are against the laying down of rules and regulations that can affect other organisations that we think should be exempt. Does not the hon. Member agree that it would be far better if we had a simple code of conduct for gatherings of 3,000, 4,000 or 5,000 people, rather than a long-winded Bill that does not meet the point anyway?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crouch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman says. For my part—and I think that I speak for my colleagues on this side of the Committee—in principle I agree with the hon. Member. We are also concerned not to be over-restrictive, and to see that the Bill does not overlap into areas which we do not want to catch. What we have heard from the hon. Member for Northfield is his genuine concern that there should be some legislation to provide some proper code. This House does not lay down codes. This House lays down legislation. Admittedly a code can be a great advantage in the administration of the legislation that the House ultimately passes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has to arrive at a sensible delineation concerning numbers and, subsequently—in other Clauses—concerning sites, to help those who have to apply the legislation, namely, the local authorities, with reference to the Secretary of State ultimately. There has to be legislation which is not oppressive against those people whom we do not want to oppress, and is generous enough to allow through its net all those assemblies that are normal and accepted, and even those which, like pop festivals, are now normal and part of our current scene but which everyone on the Committee recognises require some code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is saying that legislation is required in addition to a code. Otherwise, there would not be a Bill before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to be helpful here. I hope that I am not taking advantage of your generosity, Mr. Wallace. We are agreed on the main point that where there is an assembly, be it by day or by night, a proper code should be drawn up and agreed with the local authority and the sponsoring body so that all the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0231">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>213</span>
necessary facilities are provided. I agree entirely with that, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman and the sponsor do. If that is so, there is no need for the Bill, but there is need for a code of conduct to be drawn up by both sides of the House and presented in an entirely different form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crouch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not go all the way with the hon. Member for Huddersfield, West (Mr. Lomas) here. I think there is a need for some legislation, but I do not think it need be oppressive legislation. I do not think that anything oppressive is intended in the Night Assemblies Bill. However, I accept that during our proceedings—we are now in our fifth Sitting—there has been discussion about a great many points, and we could go on for many more than another five Sittings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Bill seems to permit more hairsplitting than anything I have ever known in all my years in the House. We can split hairs about "night" and what is meant by it, about "open air", and so on. In so doing, we contribute nothing to the good history of this House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Member would accept that rather than perpetuate that situation it would be infinitely better, at the earliest opportunity, preferably as soon as the hon. Member has sat down, if we could get together and agree on a form of Bill about which we could be roughly agreed and thus avoid the continual hair-splitting which has characterised not only today's debate but all our debates so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Come on. Speak for Britain!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crouch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must ignore some of the things said to me. Mr. Wallace. In this small room, I am not really meant to speak for Britain. However, I am one of the few members of the Committee to have attended pop festivals. This is not called a "Pop Festivals Bill", but I am extremely sympathetic to pop festivals. I am sympathetic to the sound they make, but I am also sympathetic to the problems which arise when people gather in such assemblies, because we are all concerned with the environment today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter) invites me to suggest to the Committee that we should, as it were, get round a table outside the Committee and agree something. Those
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>214</span>
were his words. I was not present at the fourth Sitting of the Committee and, therefore, missed the first part of the discussion on this group of Amendments, but I come back refreshed in the knowledge that this is the first time, at the fifth Sitting of the Committee, that I have heard the word "agreement" mentioned in a genuine way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the hon. Member for Northfield a question. He speaks of a possible agreement to help formulate good legislation. I go a little further than the hon. Member for Huddersfield, West who talks of formulating only a code of practice. The Committee is sitting to consider legislation, and I do not want that legislation to be oppressive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crouch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) nods. We know that he feels that way too. If the hon. Member for North-field can say that he genuinely wishes to seek an agreement, I should like to ask him whether the hon. Member for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson) and the hon. Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved) are also with him in a genuine attempt to reach an agreement on making progress in the Committee for the formulation of good legislation under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I do not need my hon. Friend the Member for Northfield to speak on my behalf. I can do so myself. As soon as his hon. Friend indicated his intention to table a Sittings Motion, I wrote to the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) offering to hold discussions. The opportunity is still open, though only on the reasonable basis already outlined to the hon. Gentleman by my hon. Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson) a few moments ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My suggestion may save you, Mr. Wallace, and the Clerks of the Committee, a considerable amount of time. Apparently, the Committee have reached a stage of unanimity that something should be done. I think that the predecessor to the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare—David Webster, who was known in his constituency as "Aggie on Horseback"—whom I held in great respect, would have agreed with the views expressed on this side of the Committee—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to interrupt the hon. Member. However, on a point of information, "Aggie on Horseback" is the well-known name for Weston-super-Mare and has nothing to do with my predecessor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that he, like the hon. Member, would have been reasonable enough to have accepted the point that my hon. Friends and I recognise that a case can be made for legislation for assemblies. Therefore, in view of the difficulties of numbers, whether of 3,000, or 15,000 or 50,000, and of the difficulties associated with turnstiles and entry, the definition of open air and of night, is it not possible for both sides to agree that the Bill, however well-intentioned—and my hon. Friends and I accept that it was well-intentioned—is not the right form of Bill? That being the case, would it not be appropriate to adjourn, in order that both sides may meet together and agree on a suitable form of Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Speaking for myself and, I hope, for some of my colleagues, we would be prepared to sponsor a Bill to establish a code of conduct, supported by legislation, with particular reference to pop festivals. Would the hon. Member not accept that the change of heart on our side has come about only since the last Sitting, when the Minister introduced a report which completely undermined the philosophy of the Bill and, indeed, opened up a considerable gap between the Government on the one hand and the sponsor of the Bill on the other?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I prepared a two- or three-hour speech on numbers, which I shall not seek to impose on the Committee, provided we may be given the kind of assurance we seek. Therefore, I ask the sponsor of the Bill to consider my suggestion. I am sure that it would be possible to agree upon a Bill which would meet the points which the hon. Member seeks to make. I should be as prepared as he to sponsor such a Bill. I am sure that, with the assistance of the Minister, the Government Whips and others, it will be possible to reach such agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maddan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those with olive branches who wish to cross-pollinate may do so outside while I am speaking. Indeed, that may prove to be the best justification for my speech. However, to those who remain I wish to address a few points on the Amendments selected for discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would say at the outset that the Bill received its Second Reading several months ago. Thus, there is no point in hon. Gentlemen opposite maintaining that we have suddenly seen the light of day. The House of Commons saw the light of day months ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendments under discussion concern the question of numbers, with the hours after midnight of an assembly, and the definition of "open air". Those are the three things covered by the Amendments which you have selected, Mr. Wallace. Those are the things I wish to talk about and, in particular, I want to tell the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter) why assemblies which continue for a substantial period after midnight are different from ordinary day-time assemblies. They are different because the sanitation needs are different. Hon. Members who have been in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0233">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>217</span>
Army will know that what we used to do about breakfast time is called night soil, and it is so called because it all happens after the night has ended, and one has breakfast, and so on. The sanitary needs to provide for night soil are quite different from those necessary in ordinary day-time assemblies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is absolutely credible, and I am sorry that the hon. Member wants to shackle ordinary day-time assemblies with legislation and codes of conduct which are not necessary for that sort of reason at all, but those reasons do apply to assemblies which last throughout the night.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member cannot have been listening to what I said. I had a lot to say about the exclusion of one-day events, which would meet his point. I can see no reason why one-day events, most of which would completely escape his night soil point, should be included as events covered by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maddan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that they would. I am sorry that we are getting down to details. It is regrettable that we are getting deep, but it is unavoidable. If an assembly goes on for 24 hours the chances are that we shall be faced with this problem, particularly if the assembly goes on for a substantial period after midnight. If in the House we sit till 4, 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning, many of us do not go home, but remain on site until we have had our breakfast. Exactly the same happens with the night assemblies that we are discussing. The inevitable happens, and the inevitable requires particular provisions which are not necessary in the case of a cricket match or a gymkhana or other sort of day-time event.

The hon. Member for Northfield will concede that, whatever the principles, this is a fundamental point, though one of detail. It is one of the reasons why night assemblies are different from assemblies that take place in day-time hours only. If there is an overnight element, that happens. That is the first reason why night assemblies are different, and why they should be considered separately by Parliament.

Three hours after midnight are suggested in the Bill, and my hon. Friend the promoter has an Amendment down which says four hours. I agree that there is no magic in three, three-and-a-half hours, four hours, four hours and one minute,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>218</span>
but one has to draw a line. One does not want to draw the line one minute after midnight, and three or four hours meets the point. Four hours is quite satisfactory to me, but if the assembly does go on for four hours after midnight people are liable to stay on the site and therefore special sanitary provisions are necessary.

Night is different in another respect, and that is that noise at night is more serious than noise in the day time. In the day time people are not likely to be sleeping or making other noises drowning the noise of the event. But an event that is noisy at night has a particularly discouraging effect on the neighbourhood that the same noise does not have in daylight hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet a further point is that, at night, the climatic conditions—the heat, the cloud face, and so on—are often such that noise carries farther than it does in the day time, quite apart from the other distractions of the day. Noise, therefore, is a second reason why a night assembly is different from an assembly confined to the day time.

Then there is the question of nuisance and trespass. Here we come right back to the question of numbers. If one has a figure of 50,000, as the hon. Members for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved) and for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson) have in their Amendment, then, without proper provision, there will inevitably, I am afraid, be substantial numbers of people straying beyond the confines of the site where the assembly is being held, and trespassing and causing a nuisance in the way that a small assembly will not. Again, what is the magic between 3,000, or 3,500, or 4,000? The answer is that it does not really matter, but we all know that Parliament will have to draw the line somewhere, and that is about right. I shall adduce some evidence, as I said 19 days ago, as to why this is a sensible sort of number. I shall not argue as between three and four, or 3.3 and 2.9, or something of that sort; but why it is not 50, or 10, or something of that order.

We have all talked about our experiences of jazz festivals, but in East Sussex we have probably had more jazz festivals than in any other county. I have had quite a lot to do with some of them. Small festivals such as the festival held in Ashdown Forest have caused substantial trouble of the character that I was talking about—sanitation, noise, nuisance and trespass.

festivals, when the National Jazz Federation, which began holding festivals in about 1960, started at Richmond, and some few hundreds or 1,000 or so people came. They had a day-time event and caused no particular trouble. But, as we came to the point—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
