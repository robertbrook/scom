<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Committee proceeds, I should draw attention to the revised provisional selection of Amendments, owing to the large number of Amendments which have come in between the Sitting last week and today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wallace. It is a minor matter, but it ought to be rectified. In col. 11 of the OFFICIAL REPORT of 8th March, there are two quotations from the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960. Under the second quotation, I am reported as saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"Under that paragraph, there is a large number of bodies with a certificate of exemption from the Secretary of State, and they will not be caught within the ambit of Clause 1 as at present drafted."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee C</i>, 8th March, 1972; <i>c.</i> 11.]</p></blockquote>
The word "not" ought not to be there. The bodies to which I referred will definitely be caught within Clause 1. I should like that to be recorded so that there may be no misunderstanding.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That will be done.</span></p>

RESTRICTIONS ON LARGE NIGHT ASSEMBLIES IN OPEN AIR</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed</i>—(<i>8th March</i>)—No. 1, in page 1, line 5, after "event", insert "conducted for commercial profit".—[<i>Mr. Michael Cocks.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ray Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I remind the Committee of the line of approach I was taking last week as I developed my argument in connection with the various Amendments before us. I took up a position somewhat removed from that of my hon. Friends who were proposing to build into the Bill an exclusion Clause to all intents and purposes aimed at pop festivals. In the seven days that have elapsed
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
since we last met, I have become even more convinced that my approach was right, and I shall follow that course this morning in the development of my argument against the Amendments, although I am quite prepared to admit that there is still a chance that my hon. Friends will convince me that I am wrong. Or it may be possible that the sponsor of the Bill will persuade the Minister, who is with us today, so to modify the Bill as to render it satisfactory to me, in which case the conflict between my hon. Friends and myself would be removed. But, frankly, from all that I have learned—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt my hon. Friend, but may I ask him what is the conflict? We are on exactly the same argument. We think it is an appallingly bad Bill. Can he explain where the conflict comes in?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I freely admit that the area of conflict is reducing all the time—for me, that is; my hon. Friends know precisely what they want. When I looked at my hon. Friends' Amendments last week, it seemed to me that they were singling out a minority interest, and I, naturally, reacted against that. As they deployed their arguments, my dispute with them diminished, and the conversations I have had with my hon. Friends over the last seven days have even further eroded the lack of sympathy I had with the Amendments, so I do not suppose that there is much between us. Nevertheless, in terms of fundamental principle, I still feel there is a gap to be bridged, though it is possible that at some time this morning, or, perhaps, during the next Sitting, they will be able to convince me that the gap has been completely bridged. So I accept what my hon. Friend says, and, certainly in terms of intention, there is nothing dividing us in this attack on what is a thoroughly bad Bill.<br><br>
I hope, Mr. Wallace, that I shall not this morning transgress the rights and privileges of a Member in debate and cause you to rise and call me to order. Last week, I concluded on a note which was strictly relevant, I believe, to pop festivals, that is, the conflict that arises on issues like this between the town and the country. We have to remember that we are now in the British Isles a predominantly urban community, with people herded into cities, not in thousands but in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0143">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 49</span>
millions. Coming to this Committee this morning, I was listening on the radio to a nature broadcast from the Peak District National Park, in which it was pointed out that the greatest problem confronted there was the pressure of population on the park and the countryside. A very relevant fact was brought out, that surrounding that national park, which many of my hon. Friends will know well, is a population in excess of 12 million, greater than the whole population of Canada.<br><br>
I suggest that, right at the heart of our deliberations this morning, and as we go along, quite apart from the moral and libertarian issues involved will be that eternal and growing conflict between the town and the country. The trouble is that in 1972, although the people living in the countryside embrace all economic classes, they tend to be in the higher income brackets. It is something of an exclusive way of life. They can afford more expensive houses, they can afford to commute into towns, and so on.<br><br>
Naturally, therefore, the divide between the interests of the town dwellers, the urban community, on the one hand, and those of a diminishing minority, the country dwellers, on the other, is growing wider all the time. As a consequence, pressures are arising, and it is one of those pressures that we are discussing this morning. The concert hall built in the 19th century to provide for the entertainment needs of relatively small towns is no longer big enough; neither is it an economic proposition. Consequently, the way in which we develop in an industrialised society—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are getting into a Second Reading debate. We must deal purely with the exemptions at this stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept what you say, Mr. Wallace, but I am directing my remarks strictly to pop festivals, which are covered in the Amendments. I hope that I am not drawing my remarks too widely. I think that, if we are to get to grips with the Amendments, we must look in depth at the fundamental issues involved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In this conflict which he sees between the town and the country, does my hon. Friend believe that if Amendments dealing with commercial profit were inserted in the Bill, that would lessen the conflict between town and coun-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
try, and could he, perhaps, expand on that point in reference to the relevant Amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is possible; and that would obviously depend on the way in which the Bill was drafted. At present, the Bill is in a hopeless mess, and we do not know what kind of Amendments will be made by the sponsor. That is the simple answer to my hon. Friend.<br><br>
When we talk about profit and about pop festivals, we have to remember that these are in the main commercial activities, as I explained last week. It is unfortunate that there are not other ways and means of running pop concerts than commercially, but at present the vast majority of them are commercially oriented and, clearly, have to make a profit. So the "profit" part of the Amendment clearly directs our minds towards pop concerts.<br><br>
I wonder whether I can go back now to the conflict between the town and the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We must have our discussion related to arguments for or against the Amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am opposing the Amendments totally at the present time, although I am quite prepared at a later stage to alter my position if the arguments go in favour of them. In opposing the Amendments, I must make clear that I am defending the rights of young people, in particular, who wish to assemble and enjoy what are now known as pop concerts. I believe that the Amendments are directed exclusively at them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This has nothing to do with the argument for or against the Amendments. The hon. Gentleman must come to the debate on the Amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I was within the framework of debate which would be permitted on these Amendments, and I hope that I am not stretching the point too far. What worries me is that, if we go past Clause 1, we shall not in any further debate be able to deal in this exclusive way with pop concerts. It has been made very clear by the sponsor and other hon. Members on the Government side that the Bill is aimed specifically at pop concerts. As these Amendments seek to limit the area in which the Bill would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0144">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 51</span>
operate, namely, that of pop concerts and other events promoted in order to raise a profit, I should have thought that I was not stretching the rules of debate too far in directing my remarks principally to pop concerts and the issues which they raise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are dealing entirely with what is to be excluded. The hon. Gentleman must deal with that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely the point, with respect, that I am trying to make. I do not believe that they should be excluded, and I am arguing against the Amendments. I feel that if I cannot make my point now, any argument that I might wish to deploy would be lost to the Committee. I sincerely hope that at this point in our deliberations we can deal fully with the argument about pop festivals.<br><br>
Could I go back, Mr. Wallace, to the point I was making about the conflict between the urban interest and the countryside where pop festivals are held? I feel that, either in this Bill or in a much improved Bill—or, preferably, in legislation brought forward by the Government—we should in some way deal with the increasing tendency on the part of town dwellers to move into the countryside in order to find recreational space or amenity space of one kind and another. This tendency will grow as this country becomes more and more urbanised.</span></p>
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Crouch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not realise that in the last Session of Parliament we debated the Countryside Bill, which became an Act, for the express purpose of achieving a better relationship between the urban dweller and our use of the countryside, with protection for both the urban dweller and the person who lives in the country? That has been dealt with and debated very fully by Parliament. I should have thought that the points he has raised have been well covered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I disagree with the hon. Member. It is true that Parliament, in a succession of pieces of legislation, has attempted to reconcile the increasing needs of the urban community to get into the countryside, on the one hand, and the need for preservation, on the other. What I am suggesting is that in entertainment, for example, and other recreational acti-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
vities, we are now experiencing pressure on the countryside which Parliament so far has not catered for, and it is precisely because of that inability so far to bring forward legislation that we are experiencing difficulty at the present time with pop festivals. There will be other things in the future. One can imagine a massive increase in camping and other sporting and recreational pursuits that will prompt other pieces of legislation to regularise the position.<br><br>
I shall leave that point, but I hope that it has not been lost on the Committee, because it is of great importance. I represent an urban community that provides for country people around the city of Birmingham employment, shopping facilities, entertainment, commerce, industrial activity and so on. If country dwellers are free to enjoy the amenities of the city, the city dweller can rightly claim to have equal rights in the countryside.<br><br>
As I have explained, we are seeing changing patterns of recreation, leisure, and so on, and the pop festival is a manifestation of a changing pattern of desires and needs in this respect.<br><br>
It is no accident that on an issue such as this we do not find ourselves divided only politically in this Committee. We are divided on the basis of town and country, and the Members who represent country seats sit on the Government side. We are predominantly urban on this side with the one noble exception of my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis). It serves to demonstrate the division of interest between us in the House, and, more clearly, the division that exists outside in the country at large.<br><br>
I am not arguing for urban domination in the countryside.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are getting back to a Second Reading speech again. The hon. Gentleman must explain how he considers certain organisations should be exempt, or whether no organisation should be exempt. That is what we are dealing with.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall put it in a nutshell. It is not possible to organise a pop festival in a city.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Boscawen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hyde Park?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jerry Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is Hyde Park, the Oval or Crystal Palace.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0145">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 53</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are rare places in cities. Where would one hold a pop concert in the summer when the Oval is being used for cricket, or Crystal Palace is being used for athletics? [Hon. Members: "Hyde Park".]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not now discussing where pop festivals should or should not be held. We are dealing purely with exceptions. The hon. Member must come back to the point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was interrupted, Mr. Wallace, and I was trying to go straight to the point when the interruption occurred. Pop festivals can be held only in the countryside. They cannot be held in towns. That is the point I am trying to make. Therefore, when the Amendments say that excluded from the provisions of the Bill will be all those bodies and organisations which pursue their business without the need to obtain a profit, pop festivals are caught. I think that it would be most unfair to the millions of young people who want to attend pop festivals if we were to skirt over the fact that in these Amendments we are deliberately setting up the pop festival as a singular event to be dealt with by the Bill. I do not relish overmuch the position that I have adopted of acting in defence of pop festivals. I have never been to one. But the liberties and freedoms of people who go to pop festivals are just as important as those of any other group, and it would be wrong, I repeat, for this Committee to overlook the vital interests of a large section of the community.<br><br>
As pop festivals can be organised only in the countryside, we should try to come to grips with this difficulty, the eternal conflict between town and country, recognising that it is there and not trying to pretend that one can shoo away these new developments. They are there for all time and to try to proscribe them by law would, in my opinion, be wrong.<br><br>
However, it would be right to establish rules. I am sure that no one on this side of the Committee would suggest that large gatherings of people—60,000, 70,000, 80,000 or perhaps even 100,000—in one place for a long period of time should not be covered by rules. I accept that entirely, but not the repressive kind of legislation which is proposed in the Bill.<br><br>
Do you wish to intervene, Mr. Wallace?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not at the moment. But I am listening to the hon. Gentleman very carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be very careful. It is no accident, I feel, that this piece of legislation is being brought forward by a Conservative Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member who is sponsoring the Bill has the Minister for Local Government and Development sitting beside him. That lends Government support to his Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the custom for a Minister to attend a Private Member's Bill Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend directs his mind to HANSARD of 21 January, he will see that the Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Bill has the support of the Government."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 21st January, 1972; Vol. 829, <i>c.</i> 914.]</p></blockquote>
I think that my hon. Friend is quite right in spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree. I read that, and I should have raised it in support of my argument this morning. It was quite clear on Second Reading speech. But I have no wish to go over that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are dealing with certain exclusions, but we are not dealing with the exclusion or non-exclusion of the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to go back to the point that I was on before I was distracted by the sponsor of the Bill.<br><br>
I feel that this kind of Measure could be brought forward, certainly in its present form, only under a Conservative Government. This would never have happened had a Labour Government been in office. A Labour Government would have tried to deal with this new phenomenon by way of the introduction of rules for guidance from a Government Department which could establish a code of practice and conducyt—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is continually straying from the point under discussion. He must confine his remarks to the Amendments, or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0146">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
I shall have to call upon him to resume his seat.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That sounds like a final warning, Mr. Wallace. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] Hon. Members say "Hear hear". They cannot say that they intend to get to grips with pop festivals and ban them—many have indicated support for the Amendments—and then try to run away from their previous statements. It is clear that the intention of the sponsor is to come to grips with pop festivals, and, although I know my hon. Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson) has doubts about this, my feeling is that in these Amendments we are setting pop festivals or other profit-making groups aside in a quite deliberate way from other areas of social recreation and forms of entertainment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Both new Clause No. 4 and Amendment No. 46 seek to exempt certain organisations such as the camping and caravanning clubs. My hon. Friend will be aware that there is a debate going on outside the House as to whether, if one is camping or caravanning, one is really in the open air. I wonder whether he would address his remarks to whether the Amendment No. 46 and new Clause No. 4 are needed, because campers and caravanners are not in the open air.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was some way on in the argument which I wished to deploy to the Committee this morning. However, as it has been raised and it is a critical issue—not that I know much about the law—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crouch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or about procedure. On a point of order, Mr. Wallace, I must protest at the hon. Member's continuing Second Reading speech. We have not had a single expression from him this morning on the Amendments or on the new Clause we are considering.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Outrageous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crouch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. I press you again, Mr. Wallace, to insist, as you have done, that the hon. Member should stick to the point and to the Amendments.</span></p>
<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's point is not a point of order. The matter is entirely one within the province of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
the Chair. I have already given the hon. Member for Northfield (Mr. Carter) a warning, and, if he persists in repetition of Second Reading arguments, I shall have to order him to resume his seat.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Wallace, of course I accept your ruling, and I shall accept any other ruling which you may make in the future. I can only say that the repetition has on most occasions been prompted by interjections from the other side. I have wanted to proceed with my argument but continually I have been brought back.<br><br>
I wonder whether I may deal with the point raised by my hon. Friend about the expression "the open air". I have searched all the documents and books in the Library which could give a precise legal definition of "the open air", but I can find no definition whatever. Having heard, in another Committee, the Minister who is now with us explain how easy it is, upon legal advice, for people to evade the provisions of the law, I should not be at all surprised if under this Clause, even with the Amendments, it were possible for highly skilled lawyers to offer advice to people which would enable them to circumvent all the provisions of the Bill, because it appears that the expression "the open air" has never been defined or judged upon. I should like to hear from the Minister or from the sponsor precisely what they mean by "the open air".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is it? One can imagine a whole range of temporary structures which could be erected over quite large areas, enabling organisations to escape the provisions of this Bill. They could erect temporary poles, struts or scaffolding over acres of ground, sling a wide mesh net across them, and so evade completely the legal definition—if it is ever defined—of "the open air". On the other hand, promoters might advise people to bring their own cover. They might advise all who bought tickets for a pop concert to bring their own, tent, or even their own umbrella. It is possible that such an act on the part of organisers would entirely escape the provisions of the Bill.<br><br>
Certainly, nothing that I have read so far indicates that there is a definition of what constitutes the open air. Per-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0147">Image</span>

haps the sponsor of the Bill will come forward at a later stage, as he said, and tell us what is in his mind. It is possible that one could have a moveable cover on a large site, moving backwards and forwards above people over a three- or four-hour period, which again would enable the organisers to escape the provisions of the Bill. So I am anxious to hear from the sponsor and from the Minister precisely what they mean by "the open air".<br><br>
You said, Mr. Wallace, that I was not to stray too far and I have gone on for about seven minutes without incurring your wrath. I wonder whether I can go back to the point I was making. I shall narrow my remarks down to the finest possible compass, in order that I may continue to speak on this question of pop concerts and the way in which the Amendments seek to deal with them. I recognise that large gatherings of the kind associated with pop concerts present great difficulty, but I should have hoped that the Minister and the Ministry would have gone ahead with the plans which they had last year to issue a code of conduct to all organisers of such events, in that way removing the need for this Bill to be brought forward. That would have been the right way to go about the business. The Government of the day should have had the courage of their convictions, and should not have made it necessary for a private Member to come forward with this Bill—and a particularly shoddy Bill at that.<br><br>
I shall now come strictly to pop festivals and the attitude of hon. Members opposite towards them. From time to time, many hon. Members on the Government side—I have done a great deal of reading these past seven days to ascertain precisely the views of hon. Members on this subject—have claimed not to be against pop concerts. They constantly disclaim any need to prohibit pop concerts or other activities organised in pursuit of profit. That has been a constant theme running through the public utterances of hon. Members opposite, and, most particularly, the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Woodnutt). I shall quote what he said in this Committee last week.<br><br>
I am now looking specifically at pop concerts promoted in pursuit of profit,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
which the vast majority have been so far. The number of concerts held for charitable purposes has been a very small part of the total. But this is what the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight said last week:
<br><blockquote><p>"A lot has been said about the intention of this Bill being to ban pop festivals and not just to control them."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee C</i>, 8th March, 1972; <i>c.</i> 22.]</p></blockquote>
He went on, on another occasion, to say that it is not the intention of this Clause to ban pop. The hon. Member for the Isle of Wight knows a great deal about pop concerts. He knows a lot, no doubt, about profit and loss, too. In fact, he went to the last concert held on the Isle of Wight in 1970, and he said at Second Reading:
<br><blockquote><p>"I spent two days at this festival incognito in my hippie outfit, and the scene both during and after the festival was one of indescribable squalor and filth."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 18th March, 1971; Vol. 813, <i>c.</i> 1791.]</p></blockquote>
The festival is over—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crouch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not the hon. Member's speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: —and the hon. Member can remove his disguise. We know what has happened since the passing of the Isle of Wight Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mark Woodnutt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to follow the hon. Gentleman, though with great difficulty, because he is not making himself clear. He has quoted me, and, of course, that is what I said. But the fact that there was a scene of appalling squalor and filth justifies this Bill. It is not to ban pop festivals; it is to give local authorities power to lay down standards which any decent person would expect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are precisely the points that—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Conditions and standards are the subject of Amendments to Clause 2 and of the Clause itself. We have had sufficient straying from the path by the hon. Gentleman. I must direct him to resume his seat.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was glad to learn that my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter) has begun to change his view as a result of the representations from some of our hon. Friends during last week. But I was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0148">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 59</span>
rather disappointed to learn that he is still opposed to the Amendments, and I should like to persuade both him and the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) to accept them.<br><br>
I shall not pursue all the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Northfield, except to say that I feel he is mistaken in portraying this Committee as a battlefield between the champions of the cities and those who live in the countryside. I was rather amused by his description of myself, because I am a townsman, and I am not sure whether I live in the countryside. It is true that there is some countryside in my constituency, but there is no iron curtain between towns and cities and the countryside. Everything which my hon. Friend and I and other hon. Members have been doing during the last few months on the Local Government Bill has taught us that we are trying to end the division between town and countryside. But I shall not pursue that point further, because there will be an opportunity later in our debate.<br><br>
I remind my hon. Friend the Member for Northfield that there was a pop festival threatened in my own constituency, very close to the city of Birmingham. From the point of view of the organisers of pop festivals, areas close to cities are very attractive because they maximise the number of people who will attend. But this is not a simple issue between town and country. I think that my hon. Friend was a little unfair when on several occasions he described this Bill as seeking to ban pop festivals; indeed, I think that he used the words "proscribed by law". If that were the intention of the Bill, it would receive no support at all from me or from many hon. Members on this side. My intention is not to ban pop festivals and to prevent their ever being held anywhere. That, I understand, is not the intention of the Bill, and, if it were, it would not receive support from me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I make this clear, although I do not think my hon. Friend is under any misapprehension? In fact, the Bill receives no support from the vast majority of Members on our side.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed to learn that, because I think that there is need for some legislation to help local authorities to control pop festivals, not only in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
the interests of the people who attend but also in the interests of people who live near sites which may be used for pop festivals but which are not suitable for them.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for North-field has referred to civil liberties and to the majority and the minority. I am not sure where the majority and the minority lie in this matter. There can well be a minority of people who live near a site which is unsuitable for a pop festival, and those people also have some civil rights. It is important that we should try to achieve a balance. Of course, people have a right to attend pop festivals or to organise them. But other people have a right not to be disturbed, particularly at night. What we have to do is achieve a balance.<br><br>
I am not interested in legislation to ban pop festivals. At the same time, I do not agree with my hon. Friend that the present position is satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nobody agrees.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to learn that my hon. Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson), to whom I was not referring, also agrees that nobody thinks the present situation is perfect. But, since we have a problem and since we have this Bill before us, the Government have a responsibility. One of the great weaknesses of the Isle of Wight Act was that it applied only to the Isle of Wight. Piecemeal legislation is not good enough. We need something which covers all parts of the country, towns as well as the countryside. We should consider this problem and try to achieve a balance between the rights of different people. The reason I urge my hon. Friends—</span></p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Lomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point, but will he not agree that this is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut? Will he agree also that what we should be seeking to do is to throw this Bill out and have another brought forward which will control pop festivals. He will note that the expression "pop festival" is not mentioned in the Bill at all. This should be borne in mind. It is right and proper that we should have control, but not in this form.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not now discussing Whether it is a good or bad
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0149">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 61</span>
Bill. We are dealing exclusively with the Amendments, and I must ask hon. Members to confine their remarks to them. The question of conditions arises later on other Amendments and on Clause No. 2.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The reason I am urging the Committee to support the Amendments—I agree entirely with my hon. Friend's intervention—is that the Bill is drawn too widely. It would cover a large number of activities which the sponsors of the Bill tell us it is not their intention to cover. It is, therefore, necessary to amend the Bill. I commend the Amendment tabled by my hon. Friends the Members for Widnes (Mr. Oakes), for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson) and for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved), because they would limit the purpose of the Bill. By accepting those Amendments, including the one which refers to camping and caravanning, the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) would limit his Bill to the problem we are discussing.<br><br>
I should add, to be fair to my hon. Friend the Member for Northfield, that he did say that he accepted the need for some rules at pop festivals to protect the people who attend them. There is need to do something on that side as well.<br><br>
The Amendments would limit the Bill to the subject which we are discussing, pop festivals. I accept that they would draw the Bill tightly, excluding pop festivals not organised for commercial profit. They would concentrate the Bill on pop festivals, and exclude political demonstrations, trade union meetings, and all the other activities which come under the general heading of civil rights and civil liberties which we should not legislate to affect. By restricting our attention to pop festivals conducted for commercial profit, we should eliminate all those activities I have described. On the other hand, we should eliminate the few pop festivals which may be organised other than for commercial gain. The point I urge my hon. Friend the Member for Northfield to accept is this—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Woodnutt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with a lot of what the hon. Member says. But, in view of what he said earlier, does he think it would be right to exclude pop festivals not run for commercial gain? If 150,000 people descend on a little hamlet of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
2,000, ought there not to be rules there also?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The reason I am willing to exclude those pop festivals from my consideration is that by so doing we should exclude all those other activities I have mentioned. Second, the organisers of pop festivals not designed for commercial gain are more willing to listen to sense and more willing to co-operate with local authorities to make the sort of provision which we have discussed.<br><br>
I mentioned the pop festival planned for my own constituency. There are 600 houses within a quarter of a mile of the site. As one of my constituents pointed out, the site is quite unsuitable. Even in the view of most of the young people who attend pop festivals, the site is unsuitable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend specify in a little detail the factors which lead him and others to believe that a particular site is unsuitable? Suitability is an important factor in the determining of who should or who should not have exemption under the Amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Suitability is an important subject to which we will come later. I shall then explain why some sites may be suitable and some may not.<br><br>
If a charitable organisation is planning to hold an assembly of 150,000 people on a site not suitable for the purpose, I am optimistic enough to believe that the organisers of such an activity would be willing to listen to common sense and accept that the site was not suitable for such a large assembly.<br><br>
But the problem arises from the opportunity to make a substantial profit. We are talking about large numbers of people, and potentially large profits, and the organisers in such a case are not necessarily willing to listen to common sense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is making a point about what I would call unreasonable promoters. Will he not accept that there have been many promoters who have discussed the suitability of sites with local residents and the local council, but, because of the objections of the local residents and the council, many of which have been unreasonable, the promoters have not proceeded with their plans and have shown great reasonable-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0150">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
ness themselves? Will my hon. Friend deal with that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept my hon. Friend's assurance that there are some promoters who are reasonable men who would not be so excited by their own greed that they would not discuss their proposals with the local authority and not make reasonable arrangements. I hope that we will have a solution which will not prevent these men holding pop festivals on reasonable sites.<br><br>
But the problem is that there are some promoters who would go ahead in any case. We are talking about large sums of money which people think they can get from this activity. They do not live in the area. If my neighbour intended to hold a large party, he would, no doubt, warn me in advance, discuss it with me—and probably invite me to it. But we all know of the problem of inconsiderate neighbours. This is something on a larger scale. People who do not live in the area come in and organise a get-rich-quick operation to make a large sum of money at the expense of people living near by, and at the expense of people who attend the pop festival.<br><br>
The less money spent on sanitary provision, fire precautions and generally on facilities at the site, the larger the amount of profit to be made. Therefore, there is every incentive to cut provisions to the bone and to provide as little as possible. There is a great danger that these people, sparked by the profit motive, quite properly in some circumstances, will behave unreasonably and will not take account of what the local council ask them to do with regard to sanitary and other provision.<br><br>
I am sure that my hon. Friend will not suggest that all pop festival organisers and promoters are reasonable men. I can assure him, from my own experience, that they are not. There are some who are unreasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is making claims which may or may not be justified. In order to help the Committee to appreciate the validity of his claim, could he tell us how many pop festivals, of which he is aware, have been held in the United Kingdom, and how many have fallen into the errors he has so graphically described? In his natural apprehension of the evils of the profit motive,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
surely he is not trying to argue that the majority of pop festivals so far held have been such as he describes?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. I am not claiming that the majority of pop festival promoters are blind to their responsibilities, but it is possible that there are many men who are insensitive to their duties in this respect—insensitive not only because they are blinded by profit, but because they may be irresponsible, and not very good at organising pop festivals. Anyone, without any qualification, can organise a pop festival—though Heaven forbid that we should try to establish qualifications for pop festival promoters. That would be an intolerable limit on civil rights. But it is reasonable to say to a promoter that, if he wishes to organise one, he must ask the local authority if the site is suitable, and he must make proper provision for sanitary and other things. Otherwise, it is possible for people to go ahead with pop festivals on sites which are totally unsuitable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are now back to Clause 2. I ask the hon. Member to confine his remarks to the Amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Wallace. I was seduced by my hon. Friends.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And by hon. Members opposite, too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: From a sedentary position, my hon. Friend has—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is too much intervention from a sitting position. I ask the Committee to bear that in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to explain that these Amendments would exclude camping and caravan clubs and other activities covered by the Act of 1960. They would exclude civil rights activities about which many hon. Members are rightly concerned. The Bill would be limited to pop festivals conducted for profit.<br><br>
I accept what the hon. Gentleman the Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen) told us last week, that there can occasionally be pop festivals organised not for profit but altruistically, but which are not organised well. But there we are talking about a small minority. Indeed, I am told by one of my constituents of one pop festival which was organised by the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0151">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 65</span>
Round Table but not organised very well.<br><br>
As a result of the Amendments, the organisers of pop festivals for charitable purposes would take account of their responsibilities in future. But there is a danger that irresponsible men may organise pop festivals designed to make a commercial profit on sites which are not suitable and make inadequate provision for the people who attend them. Therefore, I ask the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare to accept the Amendments. I hope that he will prove his intention to deal only with this problem and not other activities.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for North-field said that the Bill would not have happened under a Labour Government. I do not make so bold as to speak for any Labour Government, but I know that this problem would have existed whatever the Government. There would have been the problem of large-scale assemblies and people remaining on the site during the night, creating substantial inconvenience for people living nearby on such a scale as to interfere with their civil rights. We must achieve a balance, and these Amendments do. Therefore, I commend them to the promoter.</span></p>
<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might be of convenience to the Committee if I tried at this stage to put the Amendments and the new Clause into the framework of Government policy on public health and public safety—the phrases used in new Clause No. 4—and, incidentally, put them into the framework of local government and planning.<br><br>
The Amendments deal with the commercial nature of the organisation of the gatherings subject to the Bill, with the nature of the entertainment to be provided at those gatherings, with the narrowing of the scope of the Bill by exemptions for caravans, and by the exemptions which may be set out by the Secretary of State, as described in new Clause No. 4.<br><br>
I refer to the phrases in new Clause No. 4 such as "proper and considerate", "public health", "public safety", and so on. We regulate by law in many ways so that gatherings become neither a danger to themselves nor a nuisance to others. To call such regulation an infringement of the freedom of assembly is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
poppycock. The Bill makes provision—and the Amendments seek to improve it—for regulating an open-air event of a kind which is comparatively new and phenomenally popular. The Amendments try to improve on the Bill's definition of that phenomenon by providing for certain exemptions or explaining what exemptions there may be.<br><br>
No other function has been able to attract so easily so large an overnight assembly as the pop festival. The Government wish to help the pop festival to maintain its popularity by preventing it from becoming a nuisance to others or a health hazard. Statutory regulation can help in that way, but to decide on its contents we must ask ourselves what features make it desirable to legislate for pop festivals.<br><br>
Although the phrase "pop festival" is not used in the Bill, it is obviously the phenomenon with which we want to deal in the Bill and in the Amendments. I have found it useful as a mnemonic to use the phrase "Pops" to stand for the features we have particularly to deal with in defining the pop festival and making exemptions—people, organisation, place, and safety.<br><br>
By people, I mean the number of people. We have some statutory control even over family picnic parties. How much more desirable it is to ensure that provision is made in the beginning for picnics which are many thousands strong. The bigger the crowd, the more useful it is to have some rules for organisation.<br><br>
With organisation, we go right into the Amendments. Pop festivals are not organised by recognisable bodies like the Boy Scouts, trade unions, political parties, Baptist revivalists or Catholic vigilists but by bodies organised for commercial profit—I should, perhaps, say normally organised for commercial profit—and which may or may not be financially sound.<br><br>
To consider place, I think, is well within these Amendments, and particularly within new Clause No. 4. Place is important because it is in that respect that the pop festival has its big impact on others. For example, the residents of a village have as great a right to live happily and peacefully in their homes as have the pop fans to assemble in the nearby fields, and it is that right which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0152">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 67</span>
leads to the introduction in new Clause No. 4 of the phrase "proper and considerate" as applied to the use to which the field is to be put.<br><br>
Safety—I could equally have used the letter "S" to stand for sanitation because hygiene is important—is a matter which we must consider in relation to the kinds of organisation to be exempted from the Bill. I cannot imagine that the kind of organisation which might be exempt if new Clause No. 4 is accepted would not of necessity look after safety matters like traffic regulation, road access, the setting up of a first aid post, the provision of water supply, food storage and so on.<br><br>
Directly in connection with that, someone has to have responsibility for applying the regulations to the specific case, and in new Clause No. 4 the Secretary of State is introduced into the picture, but not to the exclusion of the local authority. I utterly reject the suggestion that to entrust this duty to a democratically elected local authority will result in some form of dictatorship, as I have seen it suggested in the Press.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that, since the passage of the Isle of Wight Act, in spite of disclaimers by various people that there was no intention to ban pop festivals, every application to the Isle of Wight Council by organisers wishing to proceed with a pop festival has been turned down? Indeed, within 13 days of that Bill becoming law the Isle of Wight Council went to the courts and obtained a restraint against a pop festival organiser.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will note that later in the Bill we protect against that by a form of appeal—not on a justiciable matter for the courts but with much the same form of appeal as one has in planning matters.<br><br>
It is arrogant of the organisers of pop festivals to claim to opt out of the supervision of their arrangements by the body to the control of which the rest of us submit in a substantial part of our daily lives. For example, planning decisions can have a far greater effect on the lives of people than would the regulation of pop festivals for a few days. There is a form of appeal in the Bill, as I say, but it is in later Clauses. It is the council, the local authority, which should have first control of this, as the people who
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
have to meet the failure of the organisers, if there be a failure, are the ratepayers. In all these respects, the law can help, and that is why the Government support legislation of this kind which can help if we get it right by means of the various Amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: New Clause No. 4 (1<i>b</i>,) refers to the "proper and considerate manner" for the conduct of assemblies, before the Secretary of State will grant a certificate of exemption. Can the Minister help the Committee by giving a clue as to what his Department would consider to be the criteria for conducting a festival in a proper and considerate manner?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. This would lead to our laying down a code of conduct which, to my mind, would be too rigid for both parties, the local authorities and the organisers of festivals. It would be more rigid for the organisers and more harmful to them in their arrangements than it would be to the local council.<br><br>
I ask the Committee to bear in mind, in considering these Amendments, that if we get the Bill it should greatly allay the justifiable anxieties of those affected by but not participating in pop festivals. It will, at the same time, ensure the pleasure and welfare of those who take part in them. We have a great chance in this Bill—I compliment my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) on bringing it to the house—to keep pop festivals as immensely popular festivals, which they are, and to ensure that they are in future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister deal with the point raised in an article in the <i>Spectator</i>, to which he may have had his attention drawn, which refers to a working party set up by his Department to report on the rôle of youth and youth services in the environment? That Committee, which consisted of young people, reported to the effect that the Night Assemblies Bill was potentially oppressive, and it recommended that certain standards should be laid down as guide lines. Has the Minister ignored that working party? Does it exist?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Bill will assist with exactly what that working party required. One cannot derive pleasure from an assembly unless there are some rules on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0153">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
which it is run so that one is not a danger to oneself or a danger or nuisance to others not participating. The Bill can serve the purpose with which the working party was concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could I ask the Minister two questions? I was not clear on the Government's attitude to my Amendment and those of my hon. Friends. Do the Government think that the purpose should be more narrowly confined in the way these Amendments try to do? If they do think that, I draw the Minister's attention to new Clause No. 4 which seems to have Government support. If the new Clause is passed and the Bill is confined in the way proposed to the promotion of pop festivals, what is the Minister's opinion of the fossilising effect of the new Clause giving advantages to existing promoters but making things difficult for new promoters for a substantial period of time? It is unfair to new promoters, if the Bill is confined to pop festivals, if there is a Clause of this nature giving preference to those in being and virtually ignoring those bodies which are not in being.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At this stage, I wanted merely to put the background of Government thinking on these Amendments. The debate is not yet finished, and I should like to hear the views of my hon. Friend the promoter. I see the weight of the points on new Clause No. 4. I hope that good points will come out of the debate, and that the Committee can improve the Bill by constructive Amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These Amendments deal with exemptions which will be provided for in the Bill. They were, undoubtedly, sparked off by the assurances I gave on Second Reading. Naturally, flowing from those, there are certain implications for the definition of a night assembly, although I accept that it is not wholly covered by these Amendments.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks), who kindly allowed his name to be added as a sponsor of the Bill, made a most worthwhile contribution, but expressed the fear, which has become abundantly apparent in the Press and in comments outside, that my Bill, perhaps unintentionally, goes wider
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
in scope than was originally intended. I shall deal with that point at the end of my speech, when I propose to say how I can cover that objection.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the problems created by spontaneous demonstrations, and I fully understand his fears. He referred to a friend of his, a member of the younger generation, who acted, he said, as a litmus paper. This young friend had told him that the Night Assemblies Bill would have the effect of stopping pop festivals. I should like to deal with that straight away.<br><br>
This is not—repeat not—a Bill to stop pop festivals. It is a Bill to control large overnight assemblies in the open air. I am extremely disturbed that, no doubt for ulterior reasons, some people have felt it wise and necessary to exacerbate feelings about what they describe as the generation gap. The Bill, as I made perfectly clear in my Second Reading speech, is to help the young people who attend these gatherings just as much as those who live in areas where they are being held. Indeed, many of the letters I have received from young people acknowledge that there is a necessity for some form of control over sanitary and washing facilities, and safety precautions, at pop festivals.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman the Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved)—by whose kindness, I think I can frankly say, I was allowed a Second Reading for the Bill—accepted at that time the basic necessity for some form of control over pop festivals. He referred to this in his Second Reading speech, when he said that he accepted the need for national legislation to deal with the new phenomenon of pop festivals, though he added that in his opinion some of the provisions went wider than he thought wise.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will look upon my Bill as a genuine and constructive attempt to solve the problem, because I, equally, am fully prepared to respond to constructive criticism of Clauses which go, perhaps, further than we originally intended.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly feel that a Bill of this far-reaching nature deserves to be properly examined in Standing Committee. But when the hon. Gentleman quotes what I said on 21st January, he is not absolutely accurate. He says that I expressed concern about certain
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0154">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
provisions. Would he allow me to quote what I actually said—
<br><blockquote><p>"I accept the need for national legislation to deal with this new phenomenon of pop festivals, but I am concerned that the provisions of the Bill go far wider than that simple and necessary aim."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 21st January, 1972; Vol. 829, <i>c</i>. 911.]</p></blockquote>
I did not specify any particular provisions. I am against all the provisions of the Bill, because I believe that they are too wide and they are unnecessary. Now, in Committee, we can deal more adequately with these matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not dwell on semantics; but an ordinary person interpreting the hon. Gentleman's Second Reading speech would find that last intervention a little difficult to agree with. The hon. Gentleman has a somewhat exaggerated style in these matters, but those who know him appreciate that he adopts it in his endeavour to make his points forcibly. He expressed concern over the words "substantial period-" used in my original new Clause No. 1 as an exempting feature for an organisation. I fully accept the difficulty there, and in new Clause No. 4 which I have tabled in substitution for new Clause No. 1 he will find that we have removed those words.<br><br>
It is incumbent upon an organisation requiring exemption to satisfy the Secretary of State that it has the capacity, the knowledge and the experience to hold a night assembly under the terms of the Bill. In a recent intervention, the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) said he thought this requirement burdensome in that no new organisation would be able easily to find its way on to the list. It is true that they will not easily find their way on to the list, but by complying with the Bill, that is, by giving four months' notice and falling in line with the requirements of the local authority, they will be able to hold a night assembly. I think that we must here, as in many other spheres, allow the judgment of the Secretary of State to be applied in this manner. I have no doubt that, if there is a genuine well run organisation that wishes for some reason to hold a night assembly, it should not and will not, once it has held one or two, find it difficult to get on to the exemption list.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Erith and Cray-ford (Mr. Wellbeloved) made an import-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
ant point when he referred to his own youth. He said that, in pursuing certain activities in those days, he was no burden upon others. I sometimes wish that that was still so. He made the valid point that young people in all generations wish to enjoy themselves, to be unencumbered, but also to be no burden on other people. Unhappily, by the very fact of their congregating in extremely large numbers, that cannot be said of the pop festival.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman will realise that, originally, we set the limit on numbers at 1,000, but I have tabled an Amendment which would increase that figure to 3,000. I think, Mr. Wallace, that although it is not part of this series of Amendments it is relevant to it, because by raising that figure I exempt almost all the functions of organisations such as the Caravan Club and the Camping Club, which the hon. Gentleman asked me to do on the Second Reading. They will be covered in two ways: first, by the fact that only one or two of their very largest gatherings will come within the compass of the Bill, and second, because they will, presumably, receive exemption under the provisions of new Clause No. 4. I feel that I have completely met the points made in conversations with them. I have had conversations with various organisations. I have not refused to meet anyone in this connection. I believe that it is the function and the duty of the promoter of a Private Member's Bill to make sure that he receives all representations and takes them into account as far as possible.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Woodnutt), who is very experienced in the matter of legislating on pop festivals, and who had responsibility for Clause 5 of the Isle of Wight Bill, summed up the feelings which I have when he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Clearly, the Bill is to impose some sort of conditions which decent people would accept and expect."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 8th March, 1972, <i>Standing Committee C, c.</i> 22.]</p></blockquote>
Although he was challenged on that very reasonable statement earlier this morning, I do hope that the Committee will accept that this is the purpose behind the Bill, the philosophy behind it, and, indeed, its <i>raison d'être.</i><br><br>
My hon. Friend mentioned the Guild of Showmen. The hon. Member for Erith and Crayford mentioned the Nottingham
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0155">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 73</span>
Goose Fair in the same connection. It would seem now, the number being increased to 3,000, that there is very unlikely to be any sort of fair, circus or anything that would affect the Guild of Showmen under the provisions as to hours and numbers which I propose. So I believe that they will obtain automatic exemption.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Woodnutt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend on the last point, but we could conceivably be wrong. Could he make sure by correspondence with the Guild of Showmen that they are satisfied; and, if they are not, what else they would wish us to do?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed; and I have no doubt that they will study the report of this debate and make any representations they think necessary.<br><br>
My hon. Friend referred also to Amendment No. 46 in a somewhat friendly manner. I should like to make quite clear that Amendment No. 46 is absolutely unacceptable for reasons that may have escaped the hon. Member who tabled it. The Amendment is badly drafted, I am afraid, but, that aside, it is possible, in view of the paragraphs in the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960, to which it refers, that a night assembly held in connection with recreational activities would be exempted from the Bill. The hon. Gentleman will follow that it would be perfectly easy to say that a pop festival was a recreational activity, and the effect of passing Amendment No. 46 would, I believe, be to destroy the Bill totally. I am sure that that was not his intention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If an organisation now having the benefit of exemption under the 1960 Act considered that it wished, as part of its recreational activities, to hold a pop festival for its members, does the hon. Gentleman suggest that that would be improper, and would he wish to ban that activity?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I think it unlikely that the Caravan Club, the Camping Club, the Boy Scouts or the Girl Guides will wish to hold the sort of festivals we are talking about. Were they to do so, I think it fair to say that the exemption under new Clause No. 4 could be withdrawn by the Secretary of State. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 74</span>
Secretary of State of the day would be entitled to withdraw the exemption.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would make his position a little clearer. As I understand the position described by my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Crayford, there are some organisations which would be exempt from the provisions of the Night Assemblies Bill if Amendment No. 46 were passed. Those organisations were listed by my hon. Friend a week ago. Is the hon. Gentleman now saying that he wants to encompass those organisations within his Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Gentleman must study new Clause No. 4. It was specifically designed to deal with those organisations. There are only three or four, despite the lengthy list which his hon. Friend read out, that hold assemblies of more than 3,000 after midnight for more than four hours Which will be affected by this Clause when future Amendments are passed. Even in the cases I have named, the assemblies would come within the conditions. I understand that the Camping Club holds a particularly large all-night rally, but when I tell the Committee that it is already planning now for the one in 1973, it will be appreciated that there need be no difficulty and no complaint. I am certain that the facilities provided will be more than up to standard.<br><br>
I turn now to the speech of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson), who although present at the Second Reading of the Bill, has now found in it more sinister implications. I am sure that he would not have done so for any political reason, and such a suspicion would not occur to me. He mentioned one or two small details, such as May balls and motor cycle rallies. The proposed change in the hours and numbers will, I believe, deal satisfactorily with both those points. I should be quite specific, I think, about motor cycle rallies. There is a rally called the Dragon Rally in Wales which has been drawn to my attention, but I understand that the number attending that rally is rarely more than 1,000, and people in the motor cycle world assure me that this would not be affected by my Bill now that the number has been altered.<br><br>
I am more than surprised that the hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0156">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 75</span>
Member for Accrington, a lawyer, should continue to pursue both outside and in this Committee the accusation that my Bill is aimed at pop festivals. He has had years in the House and he will be fully aware of the grave difficulties that can be created by writing into a Bill some phrase, description or word that can be easily got round the moment it becomes law. One only has to see the advertising material for pop festivals to realise that they are called all sorts of things—pop assemblies, musical assemblies, night festivals and so on. It was for that reason that I specifically kept the words "night assemblies" to make absolutely clear that the purpose of the Bill was related to health and safety. So I hope that that argument will not be pursued any further. It seems to me that to have done otherwise would have left the lawyers a great deal of work when we had finished and I am sure that that is not in the mind of the Committee.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Press and referred to an editorial in the <i>Daily Telegraph.</i> Not unusually on such legislation, there has been a good deal of misrepresentation both of the purpose and of the wishes of the promoters of the Bill throughout the British Press, ranging from certain papers that are unaccustomed to reporting political events on the musical front down to more erudite journals which ought, on the whole, to have known better.<br><br>
12.00 noon.<br><br>
However, the article in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, although using exaggerated langauge, echoed to some extent the feelings of a very wide section of the community. I hate to use the hackneyed phrase "silent majority", but there is a large number of people who, while not wishing actively to encourage steps or to take steps to "down" pop festivals or control them in any way, disapprove markedly of them. I have a hard row to hoe in trying to ensure that the wings of opinion are properly represented. I have gone out of my way to try to do so, both on Second Reading and in Amendments. I hope that that fact is properly appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How can the hon. Gentleman judge what are the views of the silent majority? Does he not accept that the correspondence received by the vast majority of Members on this subject is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
of a form very much opposed to the Bill? All those letters that have remained unwritten in support of the Bill cannot possibly be invoked by him in support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can only say to the hon. Gentleman that I have no doubt that, when he has been in this House for a longer time—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How long has the hon. Member been here?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am the first to admit that I have not been here much longer than he, but hon. Members who have are able to tell—and I am sure that he is also able to tell—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: —when an organised lobby is being run on a single subject. I am surprised if the hon. Member cannot do so. I am quite sure that anyone else would agree with me.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Madden) touched on two vital points. I should like to comment particularly on his use of the word "referendum". The difficulty that pop festival organisers experience when they choose a location in which to hold a night assembly is a separate matter from the provision they have to make in the way of sanitation facilities, safety, welfare and so on. This is a problem not exclusive to music festivals; it applies also to motor cycle rallies, motor racing and other noisy events where large numbers of people collect in the countryside where the inhabitants live and normally enjoy peace and quiet.<br><br>
Therefore, I do not for one moment suggest that, when my Bill becomes law, it will necessarily make it easier for pop festivals to be held in the countryside, but I point out that it must be an argument in favour of the organisers that they will have to comply with the conditions of the Bill. I am certain that preservation societies, protection societies and so on will campaign against these things, since this is the way of human nature, but I hope that the Committee will accept that the two points are separate.<br><br>
My hon. Friend referred also to one of the key points in the Bill, the use of the word "overnight". He delicately referred certain body functions that call for attention when one has to spend the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0157">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 77</span>
whole of the night out of doors—or, indeed, not necessarily out of doors. It is this matter that makes the Bill especially necessary.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) and others have mentioned the definition of "open air", saying that it is not proper for anything said in a Committee to be used in a court of law. I fully accept that. One hon. Gentleman said that he could not find a definition anywhere. I understand that in the Oxford English Dictionary "open air" is defined as, "The unconfined atmosphere; hence, unconfined space outside buildings, usually more or less exposed to the weather". I have no doubt that the hon. Gentleman would use such a phrase if he had to decide the matter in a court of law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then does the hon. Gentleman accept that where there is an assembly of what will now be 3,000 people housed in tents, marquees or caravans, they will not be in the "open air"? They will be in enclosed air, and, therefore, the provisions of the Bill will not apply to them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to have an argument with the hon. Gentleman on a legal point, except to say that "unconfined space outside buildings" could well be interpreted by a court to include tents. But whether the assembly we are referring to, such as a pop festival, takes place inside a tent or whether those attending sleep in tents is not vital; the important thing is that, if they are outside—and after all, the problem of definition is not new, the courts are constantly being given the task—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wallace. As there is obviously a lack of a proper legal definition of the words "open air", would it not be appropriate to ask the Attorney-General to be here to give advice to the Committee? It is very difficult to continue without him in these circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. No doubt, the hon. Gentleman will take his opportunity when the Committee adjourns.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a fact that in Standing Committee C on Private Mem-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
bers' Bills the Law Officers have the right to attend <i>ex officio</i> and to give the Committee the burden of their advice on these matters. I submit to you, Mr. Wallace, that in this case we have now come to what could be an impossible position. A great deal hinges on the definition of "open air". Our Amendment on exemptions for the Camping Club and Caravan Club could possibly hinge upon the definition of "open air". I submit that it might be convenient if the hon. Gentleman in charge of the Bill were to indicate that he has taken that point, has recognised it as fundamental, and will take the necessary steps to move the adjournment of the Committee so that a Law Officer may be present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order or a matter for the Chair. The selection of members for the Committee has nothing whatever to do with the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall bear in mind the request that has been made, but I feel that the Attorney-General would be extremely busy, rushing from Committee to Committee, if he were to be asked to decide upon such points. Such words as "fair rents", "fair dealings", and other phrases are in constant use in other Bills before the House. In due course, if the Caravan Club wished to ascertain this matter, it could take it to court.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point. I raised it at the last Sitting of the Committee to give the hon. Gentleman the opportunity to look up the matter, not necessarily in the Oxford English Dictionary but in a legal dictionary. It might have been better if he had used the word "outdoor" rather than "open air". Has be received any advice on this? Open air is manifestly not enclosed air in a tent, a caravan or a marquee. This goes to the root of the Bill and would render unnecessary some of the Amendments in relation to caravans, camping and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Coming from an hon. Gentleman who suggested that I should include the words "pop festival" in the Bill, I find that extraordinary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Never at any stage, in this Committee or outside, did I suggest that the hon. Gentleman should use the words "pop festival"
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0158">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 79</span>
in the Bill. My Amendment says, "of musical entertainment". I have never used the words, "pop festival".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then my memory fails me. It was another hon. Member. I apologise.<br><br>
On the question of the legal definition of the words "open air", in any Bill it is necessary to use phrases which mean certain things to ordinary people. May I point out, before we become over-excited about this question, that if an assembly consists of 3,000 people all neatly tucked away in their tents, I appreciate that that may not be an assembly in the open air. But these concerts tend to go on all night, and the chances are that at any one moment most of the people will be listening and will be outside their accommodation—whether it be tents, buildings or caravans.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen) made a point which the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis) also made in a very constructive speech. When we discuss civil rights, it is easy to consider the civil rights of only one section of the community. In the case of these large assemblies, there are two sections of the community to be considered: those who go to the festivals, and those who live in the places where the festivals are held. I have already made the point that I have tried to the best of my ability to find a compromise that is satisfactory to both parties and does its best to protect both parties.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter) seemed, in what I thought an unconstructive and unhelpful contribution, to be doing his best to exacerbate the split between town and country, whereas the whole purpose of the Bill is to try to make sure that people from the town who wish to go in large numbers into the country may do so without exacerbating the split. I hope that he appreciates that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I clarify my position once again? I do not think the hon. Member was paying too much attention to what I was saying. I stressed over and over again the community of interest between town and country. What I suggested was that, as the urban population was
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 80</span>
in the majority and that of the country in a minority, the minority in the country should not be allowed to override the overwhelming desires and needs of the urban community. Of course, I recognise that there must be rules, but none of those rules is contained in a satisfactory way in that Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. In roving into the countryside, the Committee is going out of order again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is an oft repeated maxim that the House must protect minorities. Perhaps, with that, I may leave the point and turn to the general matter of exemptions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point. The hon. Gentleman on a number of occasions, referring to the Showmen's Guild, the Camping Club, the Caravan Club, and other bodies, has referred to 3,000 people being in the open air. I remind the hon. Gentleman of the setting in which we are now debating this Bill. We are debating it in the setting of 1,000. The Amendment for 3,000 is tabled, but he must not assume that we shall necessarily agree to it. The hon. Gentleman ought to confine his remarks to what we are actually discussing—1,000 people in the open. If at a later stage we raise that number, so be it; but he must justify his argument upon the Clause as it stands now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Whilst I fully accept the hon. Gentleman's procedural point—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is more than procedural; it is principle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have made clear that at present the question of numbers had not been agreed by the Committee. Equally, in good faith and in a desire to assist the hon. Gentleman and to meet the many points he has made, I have tabled an Amendment; and I only hope that he will accept the Amendment in the good faith in which it was tabled. If, however, when the matter comes to be discussed, he wishes to vote against it and make the effect of the Clause worse, then there will be a question of whether the vote follows the voice.<br><br>
This Bill is basically concerned with risks to public health and safety which can arise at large over-night assemblies.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0159">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 81</span>
In fact, pop festivals have drawn attention to the dangers that can occur when very large numbers of people assemble overnight in the open air.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
It is the size of the assembly and its continuing overnight that create the need for special measures of control. Whether the people attending the assembly are young or old, square, or with it, listening to a pop group or a political meeting is not material to the purpose of the Bill. I am not prepared to be party to Amendmends which, taken together, would turn the Bill into a piece of legislative discrimination against a form of entertainment greatly enjoyed by the young people of today.<br><br>
The exclusions which I have been urged to agree to, and have been persuaded are reasonable, fall into two parts. The first covers such organisations as the Caravan Club and the Camping Club, which already hold large overnight assemblies, whose conduct is not normally criticised and whose experience in these matters is long. On the other hand there is the hypothetical overnight assembly which might take place for political, industrial or religious reasons.<br><br>
I have carefully considered the Amendments which the Committee was discussing both last week and today and, bearing in mind that the public health risks are likely to increase with both the size and the duration of the assembly, I have looked again at the definition in Clause 1(1).<br><br>
I am now suggesting that we exclude from the ambit of the Bill all assemblies attended by less than 3,000 persons, and all assemblies lasting for not more than eight hours. I have also accepted that assemblies continuing for more than three but not more than four hours after midnight should be excluded. This is germane to the exclusions. Although we shall be discussing questions of numbers quite separately, I believe that hon. Gentlemen opposite will understand my desire to meet them on exemptions. These Amendments in themselves will greatly reduce the scope of the Bill, but not beyond what is justifiable having regard to public health considerations.<br><br>
I have reconsidered on the specific question of certificates of exemption, new
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 82</span>
Clause No. 1. The Committee will be aware that I have withdrawn that and tabled new Clause No. 4. I should apologise to the Committee for the fact that it is a starred new Clause today, but as we meet on Wednesdays, it is not very convenient or easy for a private Member to draft, and get reasonably agreed among his own friends, new Amendments and Clauses.<br><br>
The differences are that the benefits of the Clause are no longer to be confined to organisations whose objects include the encouragement or promotion of recreational activities, or to national organisations. Finally, an organisation applying for exemption will need to show only that they have held night assemblies in the past, and not necessarily over a substantial period. But of course they will have to show that they have conducted themselves in a satisfactory way.<br><br>
I now turn to the question of the implications of the Bill for the right of free assembly, with particular reference to political, religious and trade union organisations. I asked the hon. Gentleman the Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson), during the course of his speech, whether he could tell the Committee of any political, religious or trade union organisation which had chosen to hold its meeting of more than 1,000 people for more than three hours after midnight in the open air. Although he said that he would be able to deal with that question, I have studied his speech carefully and can find no specific reference to any meeting of that sort which has ever taken place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With great respect to the hon. Gentleman, he must not misinterpret my speech; and I am sure that he would not wish to do so. But I told him that there had been cases of night shifts coming out and having meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Which one? For three hours?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not get over-excited. He will be aware that I quoted from the <i>Spectator</i> a letter from Mr. Victor Feather to the Secretary of State for the Environment, expressing his concern that the Bill would be harmful to assemblies of the sort which members of trade unions might wish to hold. He knows perfectly well that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0160">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 83</span>
all sorts of assemblies have been held, certainly of over 1,000 people and probably for over three hours after midnight. If he does not feel that there is any justification in my criticisms, why on earth is he even bothering to go to the trouble of putting Amendments down?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will allow me to complete my speech without constant interruptions, he will find that I propose to offer him some fairly substantial concessions on this point. But I must make the point that he is making a hypothetical case. Despite the letter to which he referred, no instances can be cited. We have not heard of the strike at such-and-such a factory on such-and-such a day, or the industrial dispute in such-and-such a place, or the religious festival held in such-and-such a place. There are very few specific examples. Only one has come to my attention, and I am not even certain that that would apply because I do not know what numbers were involved on that occasion. Of couse, it is true—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman like an example?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, not now. The hon. Gentleman should have given it in his speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not allowed to get to that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that no member of the Committee, assuming that such a hypothetical case could take place, would want to argue that considerations of public health and safety at such assemblies can be altogether disregarded. On the other hand, many assemblies of this nature could be held for the purpose of influencing the Government or some other body, or could be sparked off by some dramatic political happening, and if four months' notice had to be given there would be no point in holding the assembly. It has been suggested that that point would be met by a shorter period of notice, but that would definitely have the effect of disrupting all subsequent procedures.<br><br>
Having taken into account the criticisms of hon. Gentlemen on both sides on this point, I accept that it may be right to waive the requirements of Clauses 1 and 2 for certain assemblies of this
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 84</span>
type, even at some risk to public health—though not at just any risk, however great. The difficulty of tabling an Amendment on this specifically is that, if we do so and merely state that a trade union meeting, an industrial dispute gathering or a religious assembly can take place without the Bill applying, one does not need much imagination to realise that a new trade union of public festival attenders would be hastily formed, or that a religion which celebrated in the manner prescribed would be started.<br><br>
I hope to be able to put down an Amendment as soon as possible which will cope with this point. But I must emphasise that that Amendment must be watertight, because otherwise it would allow a loophole and would destroy the whole purpose of the Bill.<br><br>
I have tried to respond to the points made by hon. Members opposite in a constructive way. I hope that they will agree that the Amendments I have tabled and my assurances will strike the correct balance between the need to protest public health and safety and the need to preserve rights of public assembly. Although I may have strayed a little wide, I believe I have met all the serious objections to the Bill. I ask the Committee to accept the Amendment and the new Clause in my name, but, regretfully, I have to ask it to reject the Amendments in the names of hon. Members opposite.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Davidson.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Wells</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose in his place and claimed to move</i>, That the Question be now put.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I defer judgment on that, because the hon. Gentleman has the right of reply. But I hope that he will make his remarks fairly brief, because I think that the Committee has had a long enough debate now to come to a conclusion on these Amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wallace. In deferring your judgment, Mr. Wallace, I ask you to take into consideration the fact that the Committee has now been considering for approximately four-and-a-half hours six items on the Paper, according to your selection, and one of those items is new Clause No. 4, which has been before us only this morning, which deals with a number of most important—</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0161">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 85</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is no point of order involved in that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest respect, I am asking you, in considering whether you should accept the Closure at some later stage this morning, to take into account these factors. I submit to you, in all seriousness, that it is a genuine point of order to ask the Chairman to consider matters in forming an opinion and coming to a decision. What I am saying, in particular, is that we have not only five Amendments but one new Clause, new Clause No. 4, which has been before us only this morning. It affects many of the interests which I mentioned in my speech at the first Sitting, and it is most desirable that a proper examination of that new Clause, which has not yet taken place in debate in this Committee, should take place. I ask you most seriously to bear that factor in mind in your consideration in respect of the Closure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. It is a question for the Chairman's discretion, and the Chairman is exercising that discretion. We have had a very lengthy discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask you, on a point of information, whether, when we started our deliberations this morning, you announced that new Clause No. 1 had been replaced by new Clause No. 4? Did you announce that, Mr. Wallace.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not announce it as such. What I said was that a number of new Amendments had come in, and that certain of those Amendments had been inserted with the other provisional selections of last week.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wallace. I know that you have called my hon. Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson), but the effect of his speaking at this time, as he now realises, would effectively be to close the debate because he is the mover of the principal Amendment. I also have an Amendment in this group. My hon. Friend is perfectly agreeable to my saying a few words before he rises. I am conscious that you have called him, but I wonder Whether it would be in order for me to speak now. He would willingly defer to that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the circumstances, if the hon. Gentleman will be brief, I shall
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
call him; and then his hon. Friend will come in.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wallace. Do I assume from what you have just said that, after my hon. Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) has sat down, you will accept the Closure? Is that how we are to understand the position, because, if that is so, I must make the strongest possible protest at this stage. It would be an outrage if, before new Clause No. 4 had been properly considered, the Closure was accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot make up my mind. It is a purely hypothetical question at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Wallace, I thank you for your decision, and I thank my hon. Friend for allowing me to say a few words. I promise to be very brief, and I shall confine my remarks to my Amendment No. 47, to insert after the word "event" the words "of musical entertainment".<br><br>
It seems to me that the promoter of the Bill is being extremely tortuous, with a number of Amendments and the new Clause, and with changes in the numbers of people attending an event and in the hours, to get over the possibility that events other than pop festivals which he does not want to be caught would be caught by his Bill. I do not know, and he has given no adequate reason to the Committee, why my Amendment cannot be accepted. He said that it might appear to be discrimination against pop festivals.<br><br>
Let us be realistic. The only thing we have been talking about in this Committee is the pop festival. Incidentally, my Amendment is a little wider than that. It would, for example, include an Eisteddfod, which is an event of musical entertainment. But I understand from my Welsh colleagues that those events are always planned well in advance, and it would be no burden or difficulty to the organisers to notify four months in advance. If we confined the restriction to an event of musical entertainment, all our worries about caravans, about tents, about political assemblies and about religious assemblies would disappear. This seems to me a manifestly reasonable Amendment to a Bill which is primarily concerned with the evils resulting from the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0162">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
assembly of large groups of people for a musical event. The Amendment has been put forward not by any means to wreck the hon. Gentleman's Bill but to limit and define it. I see no reason why he should be so tortuous, by new Clauses and a hundred and one other ways to deal with a point which can be dealt with by three words.</span></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I call Mr. Davidson.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Accrington is not on his feet. I am.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Davis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wallace. The only Member standing in the Committee at this stage is myself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the Chair calls Mr. Davis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: By all means. I did not see him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) said I made a constructive speech. I ask him to accept in a constructive way that I find his assurances unsatisfactory. The hon. Member criticised Amendment No. 46 for its drafting. With respect to him, looking at the number of Amendments we have had tabled by himself, I feel that he should not criticise the drafting by others. I should like to know what is wrong with Amendment No. 46. It is wider than new Clause No. 4 and it would give exemption to a number of other organisations which the new Clause would not give exemption to. I want to know why the hon. Member is not prepared to extend his exemptions. Under the Act of 1960, these organisations have to be exempted by the Secretary of State. I find the hon. Member's decision a little difficult to understand.<br><br>
He asked for examples of assemblies which would be covered by the Bill and which we did not want to be covered. I can certainly tell him of assemblies I have attended. They were political assemblies. In particular, one of my first political activities was to demonstrate against the Russian invasion of Hungary. They did not give us four months' notice, more
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
than 1,000 were present, and the assembly went on for several hours after midnight. It was justified, and even as a Member of Parliament I would do the same thing again if similar circumstances arose, as they did with the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia. The same could have been true over Suez. Hon. Members opposite accept that people have the right to express political views and to continue these things after midnight. As the Bill stands, these activities would be covered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has received substantial assurances on that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member asked for examples of trade union meetings. I cannot give examples, but there are more than 1,000 people employed at the Austin factory and at a large number of other factories, and they work a night shift.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the intention is to make it 3,000 people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are more than 3,000 people working a night shift in many factories, and it is conceivable that they will want to have a demonstration to discuss an industrial dispute after midnight. The possibility of this is greater than the possibility mentioned by the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Wood-nutt) at the last Sitting. He said he did not want to be too restrictive because there could be some future activity which it might be desirable to exempt. If it is desirable to exempt some future activity, we want to know why we are not covering possibilities which we can envisage. It is possible to envisage meetings of trade unionists after midnight of more than 3,000 people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crouch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Member help the Committee? He has made a valuable contribution this morning. He has sought to perfect the Bill, not to wreck it. The promoter pointed out that the new Clause went a long way to cover this problem. He went further and said that he recognised that it might even be possible to take account of the observations made by hon. Members on both sides this morning to perfect the definition of other assemblies such as religious assemblies and trade union and industrial meetings. These are the assurances he has been prepared to give to accommodate just
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0163">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 89</span>
such worries as the hon. Member has.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to the point of the assurances. New Clause No. 4 is far better than new Clause No. 1, but it says that an organisation can be exempt by the Secretary of State if it has held a night assembly in the past. It does not cover the example I have given. It would not have covered demonstrations against the Russian invasion of Hungary. The people who organised it would not have sought an exemption. There were many demonstrations, and many were organised by people who have never previously organised a demonstration. The new Clause would not have covered political demonstrations about Suez.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought I gave a very full statement that thoroughly accepted the point the hon. Member is making. The hon. Member has not seen fit to table Amendments to deal with these points. I have explained the difficulty about Amendments of this nature. He is dealing with points which have been answered perfectly satisfactorily.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the hon. Member's assurances, but I do not regard them as satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Woodnutt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We want to see that the Bill does not apply to that sort of thing, but is not the hon. Member overstating his case? In cases of genuine spontaneity, does anyone believe that a court would convict? It seems that we are worrying needlessly. If there was a genuine case of spontaneity, and it could be proved to the court that it was impossible for the people concerned to give 4 months' notice, this would not apply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a court's function to interpret the law as enacted by Parliament. If we enact this Bill, we cannot expect the courts to restrict it for us. There is nothing in the Bill to allow someone to say he represents a desirable organisation which did not have time to apply for exemption from the Secretary of State or time to' apply to the local authority. If a trade union organiser held a strike meeting of 1,000 or 3,000 people in the middle of the night, that meeting would be covered by the Bill.<br><br>
One might say it would be unreasonable for a court to impose a fine in a case
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
of that sort. It would be unreasonable, but courts have taken unreasonable decisions in the past when faced with the apparent intentions of Parliament in an Act of Parliament.<br><br>
The examples I have given would not be covered by new Clause No. 4. I thought that the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Crouch) was suggesting that they would be covered by assurances given by the promoter. I accept the good faith of the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare, but we have had the Bill before the House of Commons for many weeks, and these criticisms were made before the Committee began. It is not good enough for the hon. Member to come here today and say he accepts the points, gives assurances on them and says that he hopes to be able to table Amendments to meet the defects.<br><br>
I understand the difficulties of a private Member in putting forward a Bill. Nevertheless, it is incumbent upon him to prepare the Amendments necessary to meet the points. Amendments have been put forward by my hon. Friends to exclude all the things which we are concerned about. They would exclude trade union meetings and everything else except pop festivals. The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare says that is too narrow. But we are discussing pop festivals; that is where the problem is for the people attending them and for the people who live near the site. The hon. Member must do better than that if he is to reassure me about the intentions of the Bill. At it stands, it is too wide. My hon. Friends have had time to put down their Amendments. I am disappointed—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where are the hon. Gentleman's Amendments?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the hon. Member's Bill. He has assured me on several occasions that his intention is not to legislate against these activities, but to deal with the problem created by irresponsible people who organise pop festivals where they should not be held and who fail to make adequate provision for sanitation and other things. I am not the sponsor of the Bill. He is. He should have come forward a bit earlier and told us what he is telling us today, taking the points which we have known for some time and tabling water-tight Amendments to meet them.<br><br>

My hon. Friends have tabled good Amendments, and I commend them to the Committee. Where are the hon. Member's Amendments? He has had time to consider them and table them before now, and I regret that he has not done so.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I understood that in your earlier selection we were taking Amendments Nos. 1, 2, 47 and 46 with new Clause 4 together, and I understood that we would have an opportunity for a Division on my Amendment No. 46. I assumed that you stand by your previous ruling, Mr. Wallace, and will give an opportunity when we come to it. But the hon. Gentleman is now moving Amendment No. 48, which is past my Amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These Amendments are linked and are concerned with the defini-

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
tion of night assemblies. Hon. Gentlemen will be aware that I have been persuaded that the figure of 1,000 people is cast too low. That figure was selected since it was clear that there were certain assemblies of 1,100 or 1,200 people which had taken place and which had attracted criticism, particularly on safety grounds. However, by increasing the number to 3,000 we substantially meet a number of objections raised with regard to certain types of assembly which might be held in reasonable conditions of health and safety.<br><br>
The definition of time also is vital. I have already made the point that on health grounds alone the longer an assembly be held the more risk and danger to those who attend become apparent. Taking into account the difference between daytime and night-time, my Amendment will allow an assembly to take place provided that it is of not more than eight hours in the first case or not more than four hours between midnight and 6 a.m.<br><br>
Both these Amendments should be acceptable to the critics of the Bill in that they go a substantial way towards meeting the points they have raised. It would, I think, be superfluous to say much more, since the Amendments are basically simple. I think that to some extent the definitions must be arbitrary. We believe that, although we have helped substantially, we have not endangered the principle of the Bill. Hon. Gentlemen will, no doubt, press me to extend the figures even further, but if we do that we shall start moving into areas where assemblies become dangerous to those who attend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take it that at the the end of our discussion we shall be able to have a vote on my Amendment No. 3 which is being taken with this? In moving his Amendment to increase the number from 1,000 to 3,000 the hon. Gentleman failed to state the criteria on which—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. A vote on Amendment No. 3 entirely depends on the vote on the first Amendment. If that is carried, we cannot have a vote on Amendment No. 3.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then no doubt we will have an opportunity before the next Sitting to table an Amendment to delete "three" and insert "fifteen", subject to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
your selection. No doubt we can be advised about that later. The fact that most of us, like you, Mr. Wallace, were up until 2 o'clock this morning no doubt accounts for some of the difficulties we are experiencing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wallace. We are again running into a little procedural difficulty. Amendment No. 3 clearly comes first chronologically. Therefore, since all the Amendments relate to the same point in the Bill, I should like your ruling on why Amendment No. 48 is being taken first, rather than my hon. Friend's Amendment which was tabled first.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment tabled by the hon. Member in charge of the Bill takes priority. If that fails, we take the next, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are a few days before the next Sitting, and in them we can, I am sure, raise all these matters of procedure, in the unlikely event of the hon. Gentleman's Amendment being accepted.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare has failed to tell us the criteria by which he reached the figure of 3,000. There have been a limited number of pop festivals up to now. It is now agreed that this Bill is aimed exclusively at restricting the activities of young people enjoying themselves legally in the open air at pop festivals. If I am correct in assuming that about 30 pop festivals have been held—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crouch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is giving the Committee an absolutely wrong slant. It is not a question of restricting young people or trying to limit people enjoying themselves in a legitimate way. I hope that he will withdraw that false slant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the obvious political difference between the Conservative and Labour sides of the Committee. We maintain that this is an affront to civil liberties. The hon. Gentleman has partially, but only partially, allayed some of the fears, and if we had had the opportunity we would have told him how far this Bill is designed to deal with the phenomenon of pop festivals. Although the increase from 1,000 to 3,000 is a slight improvement, it is nowhere near the number required. It now becomes even more

apparent that the Bill is a determined attack on young people enjoying themselves—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crouch</span><span class='membercontribution'>—<i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way. We are at a minute to one o'clock and I take it that, subject to the Chairman's ruling, I shall have the Floor at the next Sitting, and then I shall willingly give way.<br><br>
It is beyond question that it has become clear that, with Government backing and full support, this is an outright attack upon pop festivals and young people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Disgraceful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already indicated—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will willingly give way early in my speech at the next Sitting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I cannot have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
two Members on their feet at once. Is the hon. Member for Erith and Crayford giving way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course not. He dare not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall willingly give way to the Minister when, as I assume, I shall have the Floor for the first few minutes at our next Sitting. In the few seconds left of this Sitting, the Minister could not usefully make any comment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly could. The hon. Gentleman just does not want it on record. That is all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was able to read his careful brief in his speech on the earlier Amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Withdraw!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that this is an attack on young people, and by design—</span></p>
