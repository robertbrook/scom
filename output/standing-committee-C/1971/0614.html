PROVISION FOR SAFETY REPRESENTATIVES AND SAFETY COMMITTEES IN FACTORIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that the hon. Member for Bolton, West (Mr. Redmond) is in course of moving Amendment No. 3, in page 1, line 14, leave out 'one hundred persons are for the time being' and insert '150 persons are regularly '.<br><br>
We are considering at the same time the following Amendments:</span></p>
<p>No. 4, in page 1, line 17, leave out from 'shall' to end of line 23 and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'invite such representatives to consult with management with a view to setting up arrangements for joint consultation on safety or the improvement of existing arrangements established for that purpose'.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 23, in Clause 4, page 4, line 35, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'(<i>d</i>) "casual worker" shall have the meaning assigned to it in the definition to be made by the Secretary of State in regulations.'</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wallace. I notice that the two starred Amendments, No. 27 and No. 28, in my name, are not on your list of the provisional selection of Amendments. May I ask whether they are not there because they are starred and you are not proposing to call starred Amendments?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member will realise that it is not the normal practice for the Chairman to give reasons for not selecting Amendments. It is true that they are starred Amendments, but, apart from that, they have not been selected for other reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Wallace. If we happened to overflow into Four o'clock this afternoon, would that be considered a separate sitting, or a continuation of this morning's sitting?
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
Secondly, I accept that you might consider that Amendment No. 27 is a bit of a tease, but there is a serious content in Amendment No. 28.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may not argue with the Chair about this. As to sitting this afternoon, we shall have to see how we get on this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we rose last Wednesday, I was expounding what I considered to be the nonsense of committees in small firms. I instanced the problem of a guard on a shearing machine. Having read the OFFICIAL REPORT, I think that I have laboured that example far enough, but I should like to add that, in the last analysis, in a small firm, responsibility for safety rests on the man at the top, the managing director, the proprietor, or whoever it is. Therefore, it is ridiculous to talk about setting up a committee.<br><br>
I am already on record in HANSARD for our last sitting, col. 47, as showing that there are some difficulties with the term "casual worker". Amendment No. 23 helps to clear up that point, or, at any rate, to anticipate possible misunderstandings. It could only improve the Bill, for, if there were ever a dispute about what a casual worker was, it could be settled by the definition given by the Secretary of State. There would be no problems of legal proceedings and so on.<br><br>
These Amendments are intended to improve the Bill. I regard it as a good Bill in principle requiring to be put right in detail. I plead with the hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) to support the Amendments so that we could proceed without taking the point to a division. Would he be prepared to do so? If he is not, unless we can carry the Amendments, there is only one thing for someone like myself to do—seek to improve the matter on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Philip Holland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, West (Mr. Redmond) has spoken mainly to Amendment No. 3, with reference to Amendment No. 23. I shall devote most of my remarks to Amendment No. 4, but I would add one thought to the point he made on Amendment No. 3. A number of national agreements, notably in the cotton textile and construction industries, provide for the establishment of joint safety committees in factories employing 150 persons or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0363">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 53</span>
more. We took this as a precedent for suggesting 150. In those industries, employers and trade unions have recognised that below this number safety committees are liable to become moribund for lack of matters to discuss at regular and frequent intervals.<br><br>
I believe that the Bill gives the figure of 100 because it happens to be a nice round figure, plucked from the air, the first three-figure number, without any research into precedents for what might be a good minimum size in practice for safety committees. I mention that as a further point to be added to the persuasive points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, West.<br><br>
Amendment No. 4, like Amendment No. 1, also recognises the need for voluntary action and for flexibility in devising a system to suit the needs of an establishment, which may not be a joint safety committee. I am sure that no one would dispute that many firms with joint safety committees have experienced a welcome reduction in their accident rates. It does not necessarily follow that this is because of the formation of safety committees. The formation of a safety committee is often indicative of a genuine desire on the part of senior management to tackle its accident problem with vigour. Such a management would take decisive and successful action through its normal management channels; setting up a safety committee might well be not so much a part of the campaign against accidents, but as a means of making management's determination to tackle its accident problem known to its employees' representatives. In many cases the setting up of a safety committee reflects the determination of management to reduce accidents; it cannot with certainty be claimed that it is the safety committee rather than the management's determination to reduce accidents that achieves the recorded success.<br><br>
I explained when discussing Amendment No. 1 that I prefer much more comprehensive systems involving the whole work force where this is possible and can be arranged. I mentioned earlier the various schemes in operation—hazard spotting, safety sampling, damage control and total loss control. I shall not go over old ground or repeat what I said, but I should like to say that such schemes are by no means universally adopted. A start has
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
to be made somewhere. In encouraging the "tail-end Charlies" to take an active interest in safety as an act of policy, it is often necessary to start modestly with a committee. All of which I accept. I do not object to committees as a starting point, nor does this Amendment. Equally I do not want committees to become regarded as all that is necessary for employee involvement in safety matters. That is important, too.<br><br>
The Bill will tend to have that effect. When managements are prepared to accept more comprehensive arrangements than a mere representative committee, I want the way to be open for them to do so. I want them to receive encouragement to do so. That is what the Amendment is about. It does not preclude the setting up of committees; it merely leaves it to the representatives and management between them to decide in consultation what should be the next step on the road to reducing the accident rate. I reiterate that I should like to see everyone involved and that in some cases it might be appropriate to start with a representative committee.<br><br>
I intended to be brief on this because I hope that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) will have second thoughts. There is a lot to commend all three Amendments.<br><br>
I remind the Committee that when my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle (Mr. Normanton) intervened on an earlier Amendment I pointed out to him that those of us who tabled Amendment No. 23 recognised the difficulties of deciding who is a casual worker. We felt that the only satisfactory way for us as amateur draftsmen to tackle the problem was to lay the responsibility on the Secretary of State. It is not the ideal solution, but we felt that it would be more satisfactory than having no definition of casual workers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are disappointed that the hon. Members promoting the Bill cannot accept Amendment No. 4, which, especially in the context of the present time and the imminent safety report, would be a wise compromise. It would give a wider authority to the existing committees, and it is a pity that such committees should be broken up. I feel that it is rather obstinate of hon. Members not to accept the Amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, West (Mr. Redwood)
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0364">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
mentioned Report stage, but I think we ought to see whether we can reach a decision now on this matter, unless there are special reasons for not doing so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Dudley Smith)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ifeel in a hopelessly difficult position in this Committee, as I have all the way through, because the Robens Report, which has frequently been referred to, has just been deposited with my Department and the Committee would not expect me to comment on it until it has been studied in detail. I assure the Committee that a statement will be made to Parliament in due course and the Report will be published. It is a document of the first importance and both in this connection and in a much wider one it will be extremely relevant.<br><br>
In the circumstances, in fairness to all and in an entirely non-partisan spirit, I must repeat that it would be wrong of me to pass observations on what should or should not be in this context. My hon. Friends have argued their case with clarity. The Amendment would have the effect of excluding about 3,500 factories from the provision. In 1969, some 1,500 factories employing between 100 and 150 work people had arrangements for joint consultation. It is very difficult indeed to assess what criteria should be applied as to numbers. It is accepted that safety is a matter of defence. All people are in employment, whether in small factories or in very large concerns. I am very glad that a great deal of attention is being paid to this subject, and I am certain that we will all study the Robens Report with</span></p>

<p>immense interest and may have some very far-reaching and important observations to make on the subject.</p>
<p>I must, having said that, adhere to my previous stance. I am not one of life's abstainers in all respects, and I feel it is a negative thing in a parliamentary context to abstain: one should really declare oneself. I hope the Committee will appreciate my difficulties and those of my Department in this situation. Therefore I can neither support this Amendment nor vote against it.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roy Hattersley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The argument on whether Amendment No. 3 should be carried is, in a sense, evenly balanced. Many Members on this side of the Committee feel that firms of a smaller size should be included, and on balance I come down in preference for the smaller figure. Notwithstanding that, and despite our massive voting majority in the Committee, we are anxious to demonstrate our genuine attempt to meet the Committee and to produce a mutually acceptable Bill and so we accept Amendment No. 3.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment proposed:</i> No. 4, in page 1, line 17, leave out from 'shall' to end of line 23 and insert:

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the Amendment is to exclude from the Bill certain

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 57</span>
places of work which would be included as it stands now. I have particularly in mind the question of vessels which are being brought in for small repairs and also vessels alongside a quay or cob are in a river being loaded or unloaded by tender.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Normanton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What does my hon. Friend mean by "vessels"—a ship or a container? Is that the significance of the word "vessels"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend is trying to help me, but he has not done so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Normanton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a big difference between the two.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am specifically referring to ships and not to the containers which might be loaded on to a ship.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Normanton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not to a pressure vessel, for example?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am referring to seagoing or waterborne vessels, not pressure vessels, and I thought that by "containers" my hon. Friend was referring to container ships and containers, because he may have a point about containers for loading on to ships: whether a container on an articulated lorry which has been unloaded and might have to be re-opened and reloaded is covered by the Bill. I wish to exclude it if it is being unloaded or reloaded on a vessel by dockers, although I should not want it to be excluded if it were in a warehouse or on the dock side.<br><br>
I am sure that we all realise that safety for dockworkers working on land, in docks or in ports, is and should properly be covered by the Bill, or any future similar Bill. I seek to exclude dock-workers when they are working on a vessel, because it would be improper—and I shall explain why shortly—if the authority of the master were derogated from total responsibility for all activities and all persons working on his ship. As the Bill is drafted, I understand that a ship which is alongside, or in a dock, or in for a temporary repair, is treated in exactly the same way as any land-based factory.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
The hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Harold Walker) may have been on the Committee that considered the Merchant Shipping Act, and this subject was touched on during those discussions. I remember that the then Minister of State at the Board of Trade, his colleague, felt that this issue had to be looked into very carefully in connection with safety, because it was felt that the master of a ship should have total responsibility for all activities on his ship.<br><br>
The Bill would have this meaning. I take a not too far fetched example of a coastal vessel that calls at a number of small British ports every two days, spending 24 hours, or possibly a little more, in one port before going on to the next. There may be an area of dispute between some dockworkers or some seamen and the company owning that vessel.<br><br>
As the Bill stands, every time the vessel or one of its line tied up alongside or stopped in the river, providing there was a safety committee elected by the dock workers, there being a majority wishing to have such committees, the dockers in each port of call could demand a full safety inspection of the vessel. That is plainly not the intention but the Bill leaves the matter open, so that the whole of a shipping line could be brought to a halt by working to the letter of the Bill as it stands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Holland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend saying that the periodicity or frequency of inspection depends upon the frequency of the inspection in the geographical situation of the port rather than the frequency of the inspection that is carried out on that particular ship? If the ship goes to three different ports, is he suggesting that it could have three different inspections within the course of 10 days?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly what I am saying can happen under the Bill as it stands. It is not the inspection of vessels under Lloyd's arrangements and other legislation dealing with safety of vessels; this is inspection by different committees of dockworkers in every port at which the vessel calls. As soon as the vessel admits a dockworker, it comes under the umbrella of the Bill, although it remains under the umbrella of the other legislation, too. This means that before any work may be done on such a vessel, by dockers, maintenance engineers, or repairers, an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0366">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 59</span>
inspection could be carried out, and it would not be possible for the master to deny safety representatives the power to carry out such an inspection.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Doncaster, whose knowledge of the Bill and things appertaining to it is great, is shaking his head, but I believe from previous discussions of this matter that what I am saying is right, and I shall need to be persuaded that I am not right. The hon. Member could say that it is unlikely that such a situation will arise, but I may tell him that shipping companies and the masters of seagoing vessels are extremely worried about the situation. It also applies to maintenance workers and, presumably, even to refuelling in a different port.<br><br>
11 a.m.<br><br>
Let us assume that when a vessel is refilled with oil, a land-based worker has to board it. Even if only one worker were involved, it would still be possible for representatives to demand that a full inspection should take place. I do not believe that this is the wish of the supporters of the Bill, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will intervene in this debate on an issue of vital importance in this narrow respect. If there is force in what I have said, perhaps it will be possible later for an Amendment to be made.<br><br>
I have mentioned ships. I believe that the same rules in the Bill could refer to aircraft, hovercraft, and so on, so that when any aircraft landed, if any land-based workpeople at an airport, say, people who were to refuel or clean it, or restock the food on the aircraft, had formed a local safety committee, it could demand a full inspection. Here one would find oneself in danger, remembering hijacking and so on, if a larger number of people had authority to board an aircraft and inspect it throughout.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Normanton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for allowing me to intervene, because I am under the impression—I hope that he will forgive me for putting it in these words—that he is making rather heavy work of the emphasis on ports. Is it the full gist of what he is trying to achieve that he is emphasising that this situation will occur with shipping and ports, and only with shipping and ports? As I read the Bill, it could hardly apply
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
to ports other than those which are in Her Majesty's dominions covered by the Bill. After all, a ship presumably spends only a modest part of its time in U.K. ports. The hon. Member's views, therefore, are related predominantly to coastal shipping. Does he have in mind coastal shipping as opposed to ships trading between this country and foreign parts? In foreign ports, whatever the Clause says, it would have no force.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right, but it would be a gross inconvenience for international shipping lines if every time a vessel pulled into Southampton, every time the "Queen Elizabeth" came in every eight days, there were a full inspection by a safety committee of Southampton dockers. I would also mention cross-Channel steamers, the many vessels working from this country to the Continent. I do not know whether my hon. Friend has any figures, but I should like to know the tonnage of British shipping spending more time in British ports than in ports abroad.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find it difficult to contain myself any longer. The hon. Member is making enormously heavy weather of this shipping problem. First, he is ignoring the fact Clause 2 provides that inspections, except where accidents occur, shall be at intervals of not less than three months. Section 126 of the Factories Act, 1961, deals with work of certain kinds carried out on a ship tied up in harbour. That ship too is deemed to be a factory after it has crossed the Channel, or the Atlantic.<br><br>
The hypothetical factory, the ship which has just crossed the North Atlantic or the Channel, is still subject to the statutory minimum interval of three months, and it may be deemed to be a factory only when certain classes of work are being carried out on her. I shall not read them all out, for they are all listed in Section 126 of the Factories Act. I hope that the hon. Gentleman has consulted it, but he is not showing much evidence that he has done so. He is not his usual perceptive self.<br><br>
I draw to his attention Section 126(3) of the Factories Act, 1961, which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Nothing in this Act shall apply to any such work as is mentioned in subsection (1) of this section which is done by the master or crew of a ship or done on board a ship during a trial run."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0367">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 61</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Doncaster has in no way shaken me in anything that I have said. There are two points: first, when a vessel calls at different ports, if a period of three months has elapsed since its previous call, it may be subject to an inspection; secondly, there is certain work, including loading and unloading, when one has to see that the gantries, the cranes and the safety equipment on board ship are in a safe condition.<br><br>
I do not believe that what the hon. Gentleman has said detracts from the case I was making. I have said that it is a narrow case, but it needs looking into, because there is no doubt that a large number of vessels using British ports would come into this category.<br><br>
I am not sure whether this provision applies to foreign-owned vessels. If it does, one has to be careful about putting into industrial safety legislation new powers of inspection of foreign ships, which are already covered by the safety regulations under international law. We are on dangerous ground and it is something that the proposers of the Bill and the Government when they draft the new Bill should look at carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Normanton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I should like to say to the hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Harold Walker) that his intervention was highly relevant and realistic, but perhaps for reasons which may be different from those which were in his mind.<br><br>
I am acutely conscious, as must be anyone who has worked in any sector of industry, shipping, port working, factories, or any other industrial activity, that the highest incidence of accidents results from objects and persons falling. I should be the last to support any Amendment which might have the effect of reducing the measures for effective safety provisions in places where ships and goods are handled, at seaports or airports. I am deeply concerned to obtain from my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. John Page) an assurance to this Committee that in moving this Amendment he is not neutralising the effectiveness of safety promotion.<br><br>
We must also recognise some other important matters. Earlier, I raised with my hon. Friend the definition of "vessels". It reminds me, and may remind many hon. Members of this Committee, that such an activity, which is increasing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
considerably, is the erection of pressure vessels and plant on open sites. We should not therefore concentrate so heavily on the question of ports. I hope my hon. Friend will forgive the expression, but I think he is making heavy weather of this question of ports to illustrate his point. There are ever-increasing examples of chemical and oil refinery plants being built and the provision of three months would not cover that.<br><br>
There are also oil and gas pipeline installations. I would like to make sure that in some way or other people working on such installations will not be excluded. They are not just casual workers, there for a week or two: these are almost continuing operations where men are working in teams of ten to 25 or more with great danger to life and limb.<br><br>
Preference has again been made to ports; with heavy emphasis on ships, but dock cranes are obviously covered, since employed persons in ports will be covered by the provisions of this Bill. But what about floating cranes? What about cover for ships' cranes? More and more handling of goods at ports is being done by ships' special handling machinery. Some of it is quite dangerous to life and limb, especially when lifting these large containers, and it is in the movement of those things that accidents arise. I would like to be quite certain that an effective, useful and valuable contribution is being made to promoting and increasing the safety of persons affected by this kind of activity.<br><br>
I raise this not in any attempt to destroy my hon. Friend's intention to be constructive and improve the Bill and make it more effective. But I am a little doubtful whether he can assure me that the Amendment would not be neutralising the effectiveness of this piece of legislation, or weakening it to such a degree that it would leave far too many people unnecessarily outside the provisions of the Bill and therefore not enjoying the benefits of its safety measures.</span></p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Holland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Isupport the hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. John Page) and I wish to answer the final comments by the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mr. Normanton).<br><br>
We hope that the Amendment removes the statutory requirement from areas where we believe that such procedures
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0368">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
would be ineffective, because there is nothing worse than having a law which is ineffective. I support the Amendment because we are trying to ensure that if there are safety committees and safety representatives, they will be in areas where they have the best chance of succeeding, not in areas where, for one reason or another, they are unlikely to be successful.<br><br>
Originally I put my name to the Amendment because I felt that there were two criteria that needed to be met for the successful and effective establishment of safety committees which are not met in the areas described by the hon. Member for Harrow, West: first, a stable labour force working constantly and here we are bordering on the arguments about what is casual; secondly, the unit should be large enough to justify safety representatives and safety committees. I felt that on both counts the areas excluded by the Amendment made it inadvisable to attempt to enforce procedures because they would probably be ineffective for these two reasons.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Harrow, West raised another serious objection when he spoke of the frequency of inspection. I had not realised when I supported the Amendment what enormous nuisance value such frequency of inspection could have, particularly in smaller units, and how inspections could take place.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Harold Walker) explained that inspections could not take place more</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed</i>, That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Holland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have urged several Amendments to Clause 1 which we have failed to convince the Committee to adopt. Consequently I cannot let the Clause go without saying a word or two; nor am I convinced that we should let it go by without taking a vote on it.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
<p>frequently than every three months, but I am not sure that what he said was correct. I can see circumstances in which inspections could take place much more frequently simply because of the movement of ships, as my hon. Friend said, or shifts in the labour force.</p>
<p>I am not very conversant with the construction industry, but I can see that on sites there could be a substantial shift of employees, with a change of work force. As there is no provision in the Bill for records of inspections to be kept or presented to anyone, there is no proof that an inspection has taken place if the nature of the work force has changed.</p>
<p>We have tried with later Amendments to ensure that the book kept by the safety representative shall be retained by someone in authority so that it is there on the record, but so far the Bill makes no such provision. It could well happen that because of lack of proof that inspections have taken place, with the change of work force, further inspections could be demanded. I had not taken this point on board when I first supported the Amendment, but my hon. Friend's very cogent arguments have raised a number of further doubts, and I hope that at least some hon. Members will support my hon. Friend and myself in trying to ensure that this Amendment becomes part of the Bill.</p>
<p><i>Question put</i>, That the Amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 4, Noes 5.</p>
<p>Clause 1 is the nub of the Bill. However, it is far too narrow and restrictive and with the inclusion of Amendment No. 2, it is even more restrictive that it was before. Some of my hon. Friends and I feel strongly that the Clause can do nothing for the cause of industrial safety in industry as a whole so long as it remains as restricted as it is. To confine the statutory right for work people to appoint safety representatives, and to confine to those safety representatives the statutory
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0369">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 65</span>
right to ask for safety committees to be set up only in the case of an
<br><blockquote><p>"organisation or organisations of workers, representative of a majority of the workers employed at the establishment"</p></blockquote></p>
<p>really confines the Bill to a small section of industry as a whole.</p>
<p>We have endeavoured throughout to broaden the base of the Bill. We have endeavoured to make it apply to all industry and all factories; in the case of safety representatives with more than 15 employees and in the case of committees all industries and factories with, we hoped, more than 150 employees. However, as Clause 1 is amended it is now even more restricted to even fewer factories than it was as originally drafted when it applied to trade unions—in the days when "trade union" meant, as we understood it, a trade union, although perhaps it no longer does.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Harold Walker) was looking interested. Does he wish to comment? I know that I flatter myself to think that he might be interested in anything I say, but we cannot let the debate go by without making our protest.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Normanton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I add my regrets. I cannot let the Clause pass at this stage in the absence of the assurances which I tried to obtain. In view of the fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. John Page) did not reply to one or two points that I put to him, I earnestly hope that the promoter of the Bill, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley), will give an assurance at this stage that the operations to which I referred—the construction of oil and chemical refineries, the laying of fuel, gas and oil pipeline installations, aircraft flying away from base and operating from their bases, hovercraft—and the like—will be covered by the provisions of the Bill. I am not anxious to emasculate the Bill if in doing so this will weaken the effectiveness of promoting safety at places where people work. I therefore ask the hon. Member for Sparkbrook whether he can assure me that the places of work to which I have referred will be covered by the operation of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Listening to these discussions I have the feeling that we have all been here before, as indeed we have many
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
times. I hope that in due course we shall be able at least to resolve these matters for the general benefit of all those employed in industry. I was looking at the figures only the other day. In the past 10 years, about 6,200 people have been killed at work in premises covered by the Factories Acts. Countless thousands of others have been permanently or temporarily disabled.<br><br>
In debating whether to pass the Clause, I think that there is good will on both sides. But it is a question of the means rather than merely the ends. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) made a point on second Reading which is particularly relevant to a Clause of this kind when he talked of the casualness of many people in industry and the need not only to educate them but to encourage them in better practices. Whole volumes of technique are now available. There is a far better scientific appraisal of what can be done to prevent accidents, but this will not prevent the case that was mentioned—I am not sure in which debate—where chewing gum was put into a machine merely to make the operation simpler for the operative, although it represented a very serious hazard to himself.<br><br>
I represent a heavily industrial area which is part and parcel of the West Midlands car industry. I have been round many factories, as have all hon. Members, in my constituency of Warwick and Leamington. Many of the managements are rightly proud of their safety performance and point out to one the efforts they make. In a certain number, however, even on an official tour, one cannot help seeing that a rather casual approach is taken by many people. These are the ones who must be shaken out of their complacency before disaster finally overtakes them and some of their colleagues.</span></p>
<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Normanton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary gave some rather frightening figures, including about 6,000 killed. I thought that it was more, but they are frightening figures. I wonder whether he could tell the Committee whether there is any evidence to indicate what proportion of the 6,000 people killed—and probably 10 or 20 times as many injured, maimed or seriously affected—were working at the time of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0370">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 67</span>
their accident on premises where safety committees are, and have been, working on a voluntary, non-statutory basis.<br><br>
I cannot help but feel that, although safety committees can make a contribution to reducing accidents of this kind, by the very nature of life, the establishment of a committee cannot ensure that casualties will literally never arise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, I cannot answer that question without notice, and I doubt that I could answer it with notice. The Department of Employment, under successive Administrations, is superb in its analysis of many industrial problems, but I doubt that inquiries are sufficiently deep to answer the question raised by my hon. Friend. I am sure that he understands that the Clause spans those organisations where there are excellent arrangements, with voluntary safety committees, and those which have abysmal arrangements.<br><br>
Establishing safety committees, as we have all agreed, does not ensure that serious accidents will not take place. We must encourage more and more work people, and more and more managements, to realise that, by being conscious of the need for safety, they can do a great deal towards preventing accidents. I believe that this is happening, and the difference between the two sides in these debates is about whether it should be compulsory, statutorily, to have these committees or whether it should proceed by way of consent. There has been an improvement over the years in the number of voluntary committees which have been set up.<br><br>
All of this—I return to it at the risk of boring the Committee—is very material to a consideration of the important report of the Committee which has been analysing the need and means of promoting safety over a very wide area, not in factories, although they are paramount in this case, but in other institutions which affect everyday life.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Holland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely, my hon. Friend accepts that everyone in the Committee wants to do something for industrial safety, and wants to reduce the accident rate. What concerns me is why, if he and his Department feel so strongly, as the rest of the Committee do, he can afford to take such a neutral attitude now in every discussion that we have, and why
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
he cannot either oppose or support the Amendments which I and my hon. Friends have put down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that my hon. Friend is annoyed that I did not vote on one of his Amendments, which, had I done so, he would have carried. I think that more is involved than just the carrying of votes. One must be consistent, and, in many respects, this is a subject which cuts right across party lines. I know personally practically all members of the Committee, and I know that they are absolutely sincere in their approach to the whole question of safety, having heard them speak many times on the subject. I am certain that all hon. Members, whatever view they take on the various Amendments, wish to see the number of accidents reduced.<br><br>
I have taken a neutral attitude because there is an important report imminent on this subject. I cannot say what it contains. I can only reiterate that we have a completely open mind on this matter. It may well lead to legislation of a radical nature, with far-reaching consequences. In the circumstances, it would be improvident of me to start taking sides in a clear way, in advance of such a report and prospective legislation. It would not only compromise my Department but it would be extremely foolish, because it could well turn out that what I had said or done was contrary to the expert advice that had been received.<br><br>
The basic question is whether legislation can do anything to stimulate the development of greater safety consciousness, and, if so, what kind of legislation is most effective. The Opposition have been consistent in their advocacy of the Bill, and we are now about to conclude the Committee stage. Whether the Bill will go through depends on factors outside the Committee. Undoubtedly, there will be legislation, if not with this Bill then in some other form, in the not too distant future. In the circumstances, if it transpires that joint consultation on safety should be promoted on a legal basis, that will go through.<br><br>
I assure my hon. Friends that what they have said will be taken into account, just as much as what has been said, with great frankness, by hon. Gentlemen opposite. But I am afraid that I must, despite my Friend's strictures, maintain my neutral stance, neither supporting nor voting against the Amendments or particular aspects of the Bill.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0371">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Holland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Shame.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may well say "Shame", but I think that he would appreciate the situation much more if he were standing in my place and had to bear in mind these difficulties.<br><br>
I can only say that Clause 1 is extremely important and is the basis of the Bill. As it stands, it would be workable. It is really a question whether it would conflict with the advice which shall be given, or any prospective legislation which will be implemented, and this is a matter for the judgment of the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is certainly a new stance for my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to adopt. In the words of an hon. and learned Member downstairs last night, he is today "a gelding walking in a neutered way through the green fields". He is usually very different from that.<br><br>
I feel that the whole of the concept of the Bill has been changed by Amendment No. 2, which the sponsors found themselves forced to put down. It has narrowed the scope of the Bill with regard to those to whom safety arrangements in places of work should be afforded. This is a surprising move on the part of the Opposition, to try to reduce the number covered by the Bill.<br><br>
My hon. friend the Under-Secretary of State said that there is a feeling that we have been here before. I suffer from the same sense of <i>défà vu</i> myself. But what is so tragic is that the sponsors of the Bill have not changed it by any word or attitude since it first appeared and was turned down again and again by hon. Members who wished to see more safety measures more widely propagated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Holland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend does less than justice to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley), who has accepted one or two of our Amendments. But that does not change the argument my hon. Friend is making now. The Clause is still restrictive and no change in substance has been made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree. When the Bill was originally presented no attempt was made, even though it was suggested that one had been made, to meet the criticisms of my hon. Friends and myself. It is disappointing, but it should not surprise an old warrior like the hon. Member for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) that, although the Bill has been turned down three times before, it should suddenly have become more acceptable now.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle (Mr. Normanton) made a good point when he said that he did not wish to see certain kinds of construction and other work excluded from the umbrella of the Bill. I am with him here, and perhaps my Amendment might have been more closely drawn. Having accepted his criticism and acknowledged his reason for abstaining in the vote, I ask him in return to appreciate that the responsibility of masters of vessels at sea, for the discipline, and their personal responsibility for the safety of the ship on all occasions, should not be removed by a Bill which has nothing to do with merchant shipping.<br><br>
I accept that cranes at the dockside should be safe. I agree that cranes and gantries on ships themselves should be safe and that dockers' lives should be made safer. But this is the worst possible way to achieve these aims. No response has been made to my criticisms and I find it is impossible to support the Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. John Page), I have not seen the Bill before. I have not helped to turn it down. Like him, I want more safety. Like my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State, I agree that this matter cuts right across party lines. It cuts across other things too. My hon. Friend the Member for Carlton (Mr. Holland) opposed the Bill on Second Reading. Had I been present, and caught the Speaker's eye, I should have supported the Bill on the understanding that I could have it amended.<br><br>
Clause 1 has been slightly amended, but I feel that it is still wrong in principle. It deals with places where there are trade unions only, yet I insist that there are places without trade unions that need more safety measures taken, the small firms where formal measures and committees will not be effective. The Opposition do not understand small firms, we saw that on Monday in the debate in the House. We are talking about safety representatives in small firms, I do not seem how they will do it.<br><br>
I spoke at great length the other day about someone called Cissie Home. May I interpolate, Mr. Wallace, that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0372">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
when my wife saw the OFFICIAL REPORT she did not take a very good view of your describing her as a lady friend of mine. She knew Cissie Home too, and did not take kindly to it. It was in connection with Cissie Home that I was talking about a shearing machine and false teeth. No chewing gum was involved. But I do not want to draw the Under-Secretary's attention to that.<br><br>
I am terribly sorry for what has happened in the Committee. The best thing now would be to feel sure that the Clause would be amended on Report, but as I do not feel sure that that will happen, all I can do is to express my opposition to it. Failing to carry my opposition today, I am afraid I shall have to oppose it again on Report unless it is amended substantially in the way I have been trying to amend it. I want the principle of the Bill, but not the Clause.</span></p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hattersley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I thank the hon. Member for Bolton, West (Mr. Redmond) for putting it fair and square to us that voting against the Clause is voting against the heart of the Bill. If the Clause were defeated, we should have no Bill. I do not think any hon. Member can take any other stand, in that voting against the Clause is deciding that the Bill is entirely unacceptable and should be destroyed. It is a decision which hon. Members must make for themselves, but that would be the purpose and object and undoubtedly the outcome of defeating the Clause.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. John Page) and the hon. Member for Bolton, West reiterated that the Amendment which we carried has made the Bill more restrictive. There is no evidence for that other than their constant re-assertion. It was not the intention of the Amendment and it is not my interpretation of what the Amendment meant; nor was it the interpretation put on the Amendment by the Under-Secretary of State.<br><br>
My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rowley Regis and Tipton (Mr. Peter Archer) asked specifically whether in my introductory speech I was right to say that it was not restricting the provisions to trade unions but that <i>ad hoc</i> organisations could be set up within companies which had no trade union organisation. The Under-Secretary of State said that may
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
well be so. That was our intention and that, as he and I understand it, is the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Holland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It applied to trade unions when "trade unions" meant all organisations of workers before the passing of the Industrial Relations Act, 1971. Where it becomes more restrictive now is that such an organisation, whatever we call it, must represent the majority of workers in the establishment. That is what makes the Amendment more effective. It is not the slightest bit of good the hon. Gentleman quoting my right hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State. I do not accept half of what he said anyway and I certainly do not accept that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hattersley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I admire the hon. Gentleman's iconoclasm, but I do not altogether share it. I have the greatest respect for people who are or who have been Under Secretaries in that Department. I certainly have the greatest respect for the advice which they receive on how to interpret Bills, which is a good deal more important. What the hon. Gentleman misunderstands this morning, and what he misunderstood last week, lies in the fact that he insists on saying that the Amendment talked about organisations which represent the majority of workers. That is not what the Amendment said. It said, "representative of". There is a substantial difference in law. The hon. Gentleman must understand that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman go on? It is an important point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hattersley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to go on so long that the hon. Gentleman cannot make his point before he has to leave at noon. I shall conclude what I have to say.<br><br>
There are two other things. The first is that it is inconsistent for hon. Gentlemen opposite to argue that the Bill is too restrictive when the only thing which has made it more restrictive since Second Reading is the Amendment which they tabled and which we accepted in an attempt to be co-operative. The restriction in the Bill is to increase the minimum size of firms from 100 to 150. We did that in the hope that, by being co-operative, we would encourage hon. Members opposite to be co-operative as well. They
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0373">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 73</span>
have made it more restrictive, albeit with our connivance, but that being the case it does not lie in their mouths to complain about the restrictions of the Bill.<br><br>
A detailed point was raised by the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mr. Normanton). He asked about establishments covered by the Bill. I shall try to answer him, but I do so with some difficulty. What I can say with certainty is that the interpretation of what is covered by the Bill appears in Section 175 of the Factories Act, 1961. The criteria laid down there are matters of detail. I should not like to give him any authoritative assurance and then be proved wrong after he has voted for the Clause.<br><br>
As I understand the list which the hon. Gentleman gave, two of the organisations he described—aircraft in transit was one—would be excluded because they would be in a similar position to ships at sea. Pipelines and various engineering works, as I understand the Clause, would be included in the Bill. I am open to correction about this, since I do not have the benefit of the advice of the able people who serve the Under-Secretary. My interpretation is that all the other establishments would be included. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to support the Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I question the way the hon. Gentleman slipped in the remark that aircraft or vessels in transit are not covered. I am surprised at this. I thought that any vessel was covered if a number of dockers were to work on board, whether in transit or not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hattersley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Tied up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that my advice on this is not as good as his. Secondly, the hon. Gentleman said that as Amendment No. 2 reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"… representative of a majority of the workers employed at…"</p></blockquote>
a factory, it does not mean that a majority of the workers has to be represented. As this is so critical to the Bill, will he give us a few more words of explanation about it? We should be most grateful for his help on this very important point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hattersley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It certainly does not mean that the organisation has to have 50 per cent. plus one of the members.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 74</span>
Let me give an example, but I hypothesise with some regret and some fear. I take a union example; that is my ideal case, since I want the unions to have the crucial relationship in these matters. Let us take the case of a company in which it is generally agreed that one union is the appropriate union—let us assume that it is the National Union of Engineering Workers—and that the union has a substantial union representation in the company, but not 50 per cent. plus one. There would be nothing to stop it from being the nominating organisation, since by all criteria it would be representative of the workers of that company.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting interpretation of "majority". I doubt whether the Chairman—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hattersley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not the majority in that sense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 2 referred to organisations the "representative of a majority". The hon. Gentleman is saying that that can be taken to mean representative of a substantial number, but not necessarily 50 per cent. plus one. It is an extraordinary reading of the meaning of words, but I am prepared to accept it if he has taken advice on it. It makes the Amendment less objectionable in that it gives an opportunity for a larger number of people to be covered. Also it appears to cover the difficulty when there are sites with a permanently moving population of workers. Otherwise, every time there is a new group of workers new representatives would have to be appointed. I accept the hon. Gentleman's interpretation that a majority does not mean a majority and it makes me considerably happier about the Bill. But it is a strange interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Holland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is allowing himself to be beguiled by the smooth tongue of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley). If the hon. Gentleman meant a substantial number, why did he not write "a substantial number" into the Amendment instead of "a majority"? The word "majority", according to a dictionary and, I am sure, according to the law, means a majority, the greater part. If the hon. Gentleman meant that it is only

FUNCTIONS OF SAFETY REPRESENTATIVES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 10, in page 2, line 44, after 'so', insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'and having arranged with the management a date and time which avoids unreasonable interference with the operational requirements of the factory'.</p></blockquote>
I do not have the strong feeling about this Amendment that I had on others to which I have spoken, and I put it as a probing Amendment. I accept that under the Bill the factory safety representatives must give notice of their intention to carry out their inspections, and that they are not required to do these inspections more than once every three months. But the factory safety representatives are not like the factory inspectors, who can drop in on a factory without notice. They are quite different animals. The factory inspector can pop into a factory and look round without giving any warning; the factory safety representatives are there all the time; they are employees of the company running the factory.<br><br>
We are trying to deal with a situation in which the factory safety representatives might notify the management that they want to carry out an inspection—although I find it difficult to envisage what form the inspection would take—which might cause disruption of an important bit of production and which would be better put off for 24 hours or so.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
<p>extended to aircraft and shipping, so long as it does not conflict with certain basic principles, namely the power of the captain, whether of ship or aircraft? This is an area in which more and more people will be at risk, and I hope that he can find something to strengthen his proposals and make them more effective than at present.</p>
<p><i>Question put:</i>—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 5, Noes 5.</p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p>I accept that in 99.99 per cent. of cases there is no trouble: the factory safety people will ask to carry out an inspection, and propose to do it the next day; the manager may ask them to put it off for 24 hours for some reason, and there will be no difficulty.</p>
<p>I am thinking of the occasional case where production can be brought to a halt for no other reason than that, putting it bluntly, the safety people were bloody minded. It is with that in mind not having an unreasonable interference with the working of the factory that the Amendment is suggested. It will strengthen it, but my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary may clear up this matter for us. In this case I would be prepared to take his advice a little more than my hon. Friend the Member for Carlton (Mr. Holland) has done on other Amendments. I am merely probing to find out how we can cover the point that the primary function of the safety representative in the factory is something else. I move the Amendment in the hope that we may have clarification.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Holland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Are we not to have a brief word of explanation from the Under-Secretary? I was hoping that my hon.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 77</span>
Friend's appeal for information would elicit some short word of clarification. One puts down probing Amendments only because one genuinely wants to know. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary may have something to say: even if I do not believe what he says, my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, West (Mr. Redmond) may.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hate to be negative, as when one is, one always seems to be unhelpful. However, at the risk of incurring the wrath of my hon. Friend, I must say that it is not up to me to interpret the Bill, as it is not a Government Bill.<br><br>
As I understand the Amendment suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, West (Mr. Redmond), it is relatively harmless and may therefore be judged on its merits. Whether the sponsor of the Bill is prepared to accept it is for him to say. As the Government are taking an entirely neutral attitude to the Bill, it is difficult for me to say whether the Bill would be enhanced by the Amendment. So far as I can see, it does no positive harm, and therefore I would not oppose it on that ground.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What I have in mind, I know that it is one case in a thousand, is the occasion when another rule is brought into operation. We have seen something of what may happen when people start working to rule: if somebody suddenly operates a rule that he wants to carry out an inspection tomorrow, come what may, we may be in trouble, probably verging on an industrial dispute.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that is accepted. One of the assumptions in the Bill is that there must be a reasonable approach on both sides to matters of safety or one may be in difficulties and the result will be counter-productive. If obdurate attitudes are taken, the object of the exercise will not be achieved. From the point of view of trade unions and of management, there must be a reasonable compromise and understanding about when and how these provisions may be put into operation so that other operations are not disrupted.<br><br>
On the other hand, this must not be used as an excuse to get away from the inspection of an accident, or certain
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
apparatus, or premises, when there may be a query as to safety. I do not disagree with my hon. Friend's Amendment, but it is up to the sponsor of the Bill to accept it if he feels that it improves the Bill. In the circumstances, I do not wish to comment further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Normanton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand and appreciate the diffidence with which my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, West (Mr. Redmond) has suggested the Amendment. It has been said a number of times that the key Clause is Clause 1. In one respect that is a justifiable statement, for Clause 1 specifies what should be done and what it is hoped to achieve. Clause 2 however is the nub of the whole matter: not what, but how.<br><br>
I will never accept criticism from anyone, political or industrial, who claims that I am not concerned with safety. I am; any sane, thinking man or woman must be. No one would challenge me on this issue, and in this sense I support the general objective underlying the hopes and ambitions of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. H. Hattersley).<br><br>
But when someone tries to specify in a Bill the detailed way in which it should be interpreted and applied, I honestly question whether it can be done sensibly. I have some modest experience at first hand of those establishments most affected in promoting safety, those where people, regardless of whether they hold a trade union card, and the management, regardless of their position in management, come together wanting to make safety a reality. It is not, in other words, because it is written in a rule book, laid down in the Factories Acts, or because they are frightened that the factory inspector may suddenly appear uninvited and find the guard not on the machine; it is because there is a general willingness on the part of those working in the establishment, management or managed, to make safety a reality.<br><br>
I question whether the Amendment, which is clearly intended to introduce an element of liberalisation of action, will achieve the object of my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, West. We have seen so many instances when the more clearly one defines the ways in which a matter should be implemented, the more frequently that rule-book is ignored, and then one has trouble.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0376">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 79</span>
At the end of the day, management must manage. In this sense, my hon. friend the Member for Bolton, West is right to say that, unless management has considerable scope, meaning responsibility, in this respect and active involvement in making arrangements for inspection, the whole of Clause 2 will be ineffective. We will not achieve much by mulling over the Amendment or Clause 2 in great detail, if by doing so we are trying to find a clear form of words to show how the Bill should be put into effect.<br><br>
If words can be found to sum up the desirability of obtaining "enthusiastic support for"—I am sure that there are no statutory words—that is the only means by which the Bill, or any other similar legislation, may be made effective. To this extent the Amendment neither commands my support nor my objection. My hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, West, was therefore fully justified in saying that the Amendment was tabled to promote discussion rather than to improve the wording of the Clause.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Holland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 11, in page 3, line 6, leave out subsection (3) and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'(3) Where a fatality or a dangerous accident or occurrence takes place, safety representatives shall be permitted by the occupier to inspect the scene of it, and, so far as necessary for the purpose of ascertaining the circumstances of it, any machinery or plant in the factory.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>For this purpose, "dangerous accident or occurrence" means such classes of incident as shall be prescribed by the Secretary of State in regulations.'</p></blockquote>
This is an Amendment of the <i>genre</i> of our earlier Amendment about casual labour. We feel that the Bill as drafted is too woolly and indefinite, and will cause much dispute and argument on interpretation. The Amendment defines, as far as we as amateur draftsmen can define, the circumstances in which the inspection shall be carried out, but we finally pass the buck to the Secretary of State to make regulations defining" dangerous accident or occurrence", because, again, this is something that could very well lead to much dispute and argument. We are trying to make the drafting of the Bill more precise and clear for eventual use.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Holland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Wallace. I shall devote my remarks mainly to the Amendment No. 13, but the whole group serves the general purpose of avoiding the criticism which I voiced on Second Reading against granting rights without responsibilities. By the Amendments we seek to impose responsibilities commensurate with the rights that are being granted.<br><br>
Under Clause 2(5), once an inspection is completed, the safety representatives are permitted to record in a register the date of the inspection, the parts of the factory they have inspected, and a note of anything which they have found which they regard as prejudicial to the safety and health of those employed.<br><br>
Although the occupier is bound to provide a register, the representatives are not bound to fill in any reports in it. It is at their option. The Bill is permissive and not mandatory on that point. Indeed, the right hon. Lady the Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0377">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 81</span>
Blackburn (Mrs. Castle), on Second Reading of the Employed Persons (Health and Safety) Bill, said that the Bill did not make that an absolute requirement; but she added:
<br><blockquote><p>"… I hope that representatives will, as a matter of course, do this. Such records would be of very great value to occupiers and safety committees and would, incidentally, minimise the risk of disputes about where and when an inspection has taken place."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 2nd March, 1970; Vol. 797, c. 56.]</p></blockquote>
If when the right hon. Lady believed that, I cannot understand why it has not become mandatory in the Bill for that to take place. The purpose of the Amendment is to make the requirement mandatory. It seems quite unreasonable that safety representatives should be able to undertake a formal inspection during working hours and then give no report on what they have seen, even if the report said only, "Satisfactory".<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
Again, the hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Harold Walker), in the Second Reading debate to which I have earlier referred, on 2nd March, 1970, at cols. 163–4, referred to precedents in the Mines and Quarries Act, 1954. The Amendment follows the precedent of Section 123(7) of that Act, as well the hon. Gentlemen recognises, I see, by his gentle smile. It reads:

<p>Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 are minor Amendments which nevertheless raise points of some importance. Their purpose is to make clear that the register is the property of the occupier who has to provide it. Again, we are trying to be more precise than the Bill.</p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Holland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Under Clause 3 the following qualifications for safety representatives are required: first, that a safety representatives must be at least 23 years of age; secondly, he must have worked at least five years, continuously or not, in industry since he became 18; thirdly, he must, so far as practicable, have been employed in the factory concerned for two years.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 83</span>
The purpose of the Amendments is to require that the individual has worked continuously for five years in that or in a similar factory before being considered for the position of safety representative. By the Amendments we seek to ensure that whoever is appointed as a safety representative knows what it is all about and knows something of the organisation and the factory in which he is working. We do not believe that the qualifications now required by the Bill are adequate for that purpose.<br><br>
A number of hon. Members on the Second Reading urged that there should be some provision for training and experience rather further than the Bill goes, and by these Amendments we are endeavouring to fill that gap. Obviously, an established and formalised training course would be ideal but, as a halfway house to that, we are trying to expand the requirement of experience in a factory, because we think that this could be effected more quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to speak to these Amendments on the basis that because I have said so much in the past about what I know of industry, I should like now to indicate the difficulties that could arise from what I do not know. For instance, I have had far more than five years' experience in some industries and, therefore, there would be some industries where I should not recognise the need for particular safety measures. To say that someone who has spent five years in industry should suddenly go into a completely different environment and be regarded as a competent safety inspector is nonsense.</span></p>

Friends in their attempt to introduce an element of reality, as opposed to academic definition, into this figure of five years. There must be many of us who know of people who are highly experienced and highly qualified after only one year. I have served on a training board whose members were acutely conscious of the need to promote safety in various ways and we did so by establishing training courses. A number of people who went to those courses were new to industry as a whole, having come from offices and shops and, therefore, not covered by the Bill, and in a short time they were able to make an effective contribution on voluntary factory safety committees.<br><br>
As I have said, what matters is an attitude of mind and a willingness on the part of people to be constructive and contribute rather more than the actual text of a Bill, or what the hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary hope will become a Statutory Instrument to promote safety.

<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Holland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 20, in 'age 4, line 12, at end add:
<br><blockquote><p>'(6) On any occasion on which safety representatives carry out an inspection under section 2 of this Act, or on which a meeting of a safety committee takes place, the representatives or the committee shall not be entitled to preclude from accompanying them any of the following persons, that is to say—
<ol>
<li>in the case of an inspection, the occupier of the factory or any person or persons not being more than two, nominated by him; or</li>
<li>in the case of a meeting of the committee, the occupier or any person nominated by him'.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The Amendment has two separate parts. It follows a precedent set by Section 123(5) of the Mines and Quarries Act, 1954. We keep coming back to this Act. I had hoped that where we were following precedents, we should have some support from hon. Gentlemen opposite. It is an Act which the hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Harold Walker) has always been pleased to quote in support of his arguments.<br><br>
Under that Act, when a panel of inspection of workmen makes an inspection of a mine or quarry, the panel is entitled to be accompanied by its advisers, but it is not allowed to preclude from accompanying it on inspection the owner of the mine or quarry or his nominee and the manager and his nominee. That is presumably designed to prevent workmen's inspections from taking place without the representatives of management being present to note observations made and to deal with any problems or complaints. It is clearly desirable that a similar provision should apply in the Bill when safety representatives carry out their inspections.<br><br>
I hope the hon. Member for Birmingham Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) and his hon.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
<p>sponsors of the Bill would readily accept the Amendment as being an improvement on their original wording.</p>
<p><i>Question put:</i> That the Amendment be made:</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 3, Noes 5.</p>
<p>Friends will feel kindly about the Amendment and consider carefully the possibility of accepting it. They are so reluctant this morning to rise and give us their reasons for acceptance or otherwise. If the Amendment were accepted, it would give the occupier or up to two of his nominees the right to attend inspections and in large companies one of them would obviously be the paid safety officer of the firm.</p>
<p>The other half of the Amendment deals with safety committees and it may seem a little strange, as Clause 1(1)(<i>b</i>) imposes on the management the duty at the request of the safety representatives to appoint persons from the management side to serve on the safety committee. It might well be that for some particular meeting of the committee the occupier wanted to attend personally, or to send a specific deputy, although neither he nor the deputy was actually a member of the safety committee. It could be valuable to a committee for that to happen from time to time.</p>
<p>It might be, for example, that the occupier had reason to believe that matters would come before the safety committee which raised serious industrial or financial considerations with which the management's nominees on the safety committee were not necessarily competent to deal because they had been appointed in the light of their expertise in safety only. In these circumstances, a legalistically-minded committee, or one where bad industrial relations prevailed, might tell the occupier that he was ineligible to attend the meeting as he was not a member of the committee.</p>
<p>Again, we are trying to produce arrangements that will be effective. We are trying to broaden the general scope of the Bill with the express purpose of making it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0380">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
more effective. That has been our intention in all our Amendments. We have tried to prevail upon the hon. Gentleman to accept our Amendments. He has shown in one or two cases—far too few—that he is willing to be amenable. I hope that in this case he will look kindly on the Amendment and accept it.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Normanton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am certain that I have not collaborated or colluded with the hon. Member for Carlton (Mr. Holland). I am certain that the Amendment is a realistic attempt to anticipate the kind of conflict which may occur. I know of situations where there have occurred conflicts between management and representatives of men and women on the shop floor.<br><br>
I am sure, Mr. Wallace, that you will not allow me to give individual experiences which would highlight this factor, but I will, with your permission, quote one example where it occurred, where a meeting of members of a voluntarily established safety committee decided to take the law without a law into their own hands and investigate an accident which had occurred at a cotton mill hoist.<br><br>
In the normal way, the factory inspector, the manager or representatives of management and those members of the safety committee, would have all assembled and carried out a thorough investigation of the reason an accident had occurred. On the occasion that gave rise to this incident, a man put his toe through the mid-bar gate—I think it is called—of the lift as the lift came down, and the front of his foot was chopped off. These rather enthusiastic promoters of safety decided to take the law into their own hands and investigate what happened.<br><br>
One of their body said that the man must have been a damned fool—I do not know whether that is a Parliamentary expression—to have had his foot chopped off as the lift came down. That was all he did. The man put his own foot there and chopped his own foot off again. This could not have happened were the inspection to have taken place——</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hattersley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The same foot each time?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Normanton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was a different person, but both of them had one thing in common—they were both damn fools.<br><br>
This sort of accident would not have occurred were inspections to take place
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
of statutorily-enforced requirement to include management. Where people, enthusiasts or not, go independently of management, and, worst of all, go in defiance of management, great problems may arise. I earnestly believe that if we try to spell out how the Bill should be put into effect, the Amendment will be one small attempt to make the definition of what should be done and how it should be done more realistic.<br><br>
We also have the kind of situation which I know exists, certainly in some factories where there is, through the medium of a committee, the mechanism by means of which there may be witch hunts. I know of examples and I am sure hon. Members on both sides of the Committee could think of examples of a committee of this kind, although intended to bring people together with the purpose of promoting the common good, use this kind of instrument for a selective attack on an individual in middle or lower management. I can think of cases where an inter-union dispute simmering below the surface may be stoked to an unpleasant level by the official members of a safety committee taking it into their own hands and going ahead and making inspections other than in the company of management.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hattersley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious that the hon. Member should not adduce arguments in support of the Amendment that so worry us as to change our minds about supporting it. As things stand, we intend to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Normanton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear that the hon. Member intends to support the Amendment, because, from the position of management, I believe that it makes a realistic contribution towards making the Bill more effective than it would be without.</span></p>

Safety committees could be made to cover an enormous number of factories. For example, in a company like ICI, with factories all over the place, unless we are careful we shall have the same safety committees wandering about all over the country looking at problems in Birmingham, Northwich and elsewhere. Under the Amendment, the occupier should say whether his factory was an individual unit.</span></p>

<p><i>Question put</i>, That the Amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes, 3, Noes 5.</p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Normanton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With equal brevity I shall speak in support of the Amendment. It is a small but realistic proposal which may well prevent conflict arising. We are dealing with an important aspect of safety which covers the whole field of industry, not just one individual factory or group of factories, or one section of people who work in a factory, whether they be management or men. The insertion of:
<br><blockquote><p>"at the option of the occupier"</p></blockquote>
introduces an element of reasonableness in the context of this Schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Question is———</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wallace. We are in some difficulty. We have the arguments explaining our proposals, but we never know the arguments against. Could we not hear from the sponsors of the Bill why they are opposed to the Amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hattersley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The simple objection is that it makes it impossible for aggregation in such a way that companies are included in what is now the 150 limit. We should not like a situation where, say, a large building firm so organised its affairs that on each side there were, perhaps, 149 men. This would be a way of escaping the provisions of the Bill, and since we want that sort of company with many sides to be included through aggregation, we think the provision is necessary.</span></p>

<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 3, Noes 5.</p>

<p><i>Question proposed</i>, That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hattersley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I, Mr. Wallace, on behalf of the Opposition, and I am sure also of the Government, express our thanks to you for chairing the Committee in the way you have? We should also wish to add our thanks to your Clerk, Mr. Ryle, to the representatives of HANSARD who have a particularly difficult time when I am speaking in my peculiarly flat Yorkshire accent. I am sure, also, that we all feel that the officials of the Department of Employment, whose role in the Committee is obscure, have made a substantial contribution to the advice the Under-Secretary has given to the Committee. But we are grateful to you, in particular, Mr. Wallace. I suspect there have been more difficult Committees to chair and I daresay you have had some of them and will again. We are extremely grateful and hope you have found this a comparatively pleasurable and simple experience.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I sincerely associate myself with the remarks of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) and thank you, Mr. Wallace, for the good-natured way in which you have presided over our deliberations. I felt this morning
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
that my hon. Friends were rather like the Australian batsmen in the way they collapsed. They had some difficulties through the non-co-operation of the sponsors of the Bill and hon. Members opposite. But, on the whole, the proceedings have been goodnatured and useful comments have been made.<br><br>
I hope and pray that this matter will be resolved one way or the other, either through the Bill or other legislation, because I do not think that if I am spared still to serve in office that I can go round the course once again on the Bill. I have heard all the arguments now so many times that I feel that perhaps other persons than myself might be inclined to deal with it. But we thank you very much, Mr. Wallace. Personally I am also grateful to all hon. Members that we have finished in two sittings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Holland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I, as one of the <i>enfants terribles</i>, Mr. Wallace, also express my thanks to you, particularly for your tolerance and forbearance and for your preservation of the rights of the minority, albeit you did not cast your casting vote our way. I give you my warmest thanks for the way you have conducted the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very much obliged.</span></p>
