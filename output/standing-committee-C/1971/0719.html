<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thank you very much for accepting the Amendments, Captain Elliot. I admit that they were tabled rather late last night. They are merely tidying Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Their purpose is to make it abundantly clear that the unit price must be disclosed at the point of retail sale. That, after all, is what matters. They do not detract from the essential meaning or purpose of the Bill. In order that we may have a fairly wide-ranging "Clause stand part" debate, I merely suggest that the Amendments be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 2, in page 1, line 7, after "for", insert "retail".—[	<i>Mr. Cormack.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>, That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This almost amounts to a mini Second Reading debate, as the Bill has only one effective Clause. In moving that Clause 1 stand part of the Bill, I should like to outline briefly the background to its provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is essentially a simple Bill. It is designed to help the shopper, and especially the housewife. It seems to me that there are certain items of information to which the shopper is absolutely entitled. For instance, we accept that the ingredients in foodstuffs should be made known on the packet or the container so that the shopper knows what the con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
tents are. Just as it is accepted that this is right and proper, so I believe that it is right that the shopper should be able to know the price per appropriate unit of measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone knows—and my wife is constantly reminding me of this—how difficult it is to stretch the housekeeping money sufficiently these days and to decide just where the best value for money lies. Far too often the weekly trek to the supermarket, clutching children and pushing a trolley, is more like a lucky dip or shoppers' roulette. The harassed housewife, faced as she is with boxes and packets, tubes and tins, and bamboozled by special offers, attempts to make a choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Very often, she does not know exactly what she bought until she reaches home. The box of biscuits which she thought contained ½lb. turns out to be 7 ozs.; the jar of jam which she thought was 1 lb. is 12 ozs.; the giant-sized toothpaste is 85 gms., whereas the one she bought last week was 80 cc. Which contains the most, and which is the better value? Then there is that enormous packet of detergent with "3p off" in bold letters; just what sort of a best buy is that—3p off what?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here are some typical examples I gathered myself on a brief visit: one brand of tomato ketchup, 15 ozs. for 10p and next to it a 12oz bottle for 7½p. Who can tell at a glance which is the better value? Instant mashed potato: two packets, both claiming to serve five to six people, looking roughly the same size, but one is 12½p and the other 7p, the cheaper containing significantly more than the more expensive. A whole of range of biscuits: which is the best value here? The ½lb. for 6½p, 7½ ozs. for 6p, 6½ ozs. for 4½p. 7 ozs. for 6p? Who can work out quickly which offers the better value there?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At a time when the curse of inflation is felt in every home, when one of the fundamental aims of the Government must be to take all necessary and practical steps to discourage and guard against all unjustified price rises and to enable the housewife to judge the true value of her purchases, the Bill must be considered extremely carefully. For some 50 years now, in this country there has been the traditional safeguard against deception of standard quantities in many prepackaged foodstuffs. Everybody knows that butter, tea, milk, sugar and many other things
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0443">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
have been required to be served in standard quantities for this length of time. That makes it easier for the housewife to make comparisons between brands; standard quantities should be our aim wherever possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, not all goods are suitable for packing in this manner, especially where the products are packaged by numbers or by volume. Therefore, as an alternative to the standard quantity idea, consumer protection organisations here, on the Continent and in America have advocated unit pricing for some time. In Germany, for instance, there is a law which makes it necessary
	<br><blockquote><p>"for all filled packages to have on the packet or on a price ticket on or beside the filled package, clearly visible and distinctly readable, the price asked per 1 kilo or 1 litre of the product."</p></blockquote>
In the U.S.A. and in other parts of Europe there has been a lot of voluntary progress along these lines. Of course, even in this country the idea is familiar to those housewives who buy cheese and meat in prepacked quantities in the supermarkets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, with any change in the law there are certain objections which must be considered. Manufacturers have a legitimate fear that this proposal might impose additional duties upon them which would force up the price of their articles and therefore be counter-productive. Retailers have the same fear. Over the last few months—and without sounding conceited I hope that I may say since the Bill was first presented in the House—there has been discussion with many organisations. I have a letter from the Food Manufacturers' Federation which deals at some length with this problem, saying that the Federation feels that by my Amendments this morning the only undesirable element in the Bill will be removed without destroying the underlying principle, and the Federation gives the Bill its support and blessing. That is a significant move.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent months many of our big chain supermarkets, including Fine Fare, Sainsbury and Waitrose, have begun to experiment with unit pricing. The big question—"Is it worth it?"—has to be answered. The only way in which one can attempt to answer it is to look at the most significant piece of research that has been done
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
into unit pricing. It is the research sponsored by the Canadian Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs, published in May of this year, to which I should like to refer briefly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report points out that last year the Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act in Canada received the Royal Assent and that the Federal Minister wrote to the presidents of the nine leading supermarket chains operating in Canada urging them to initiate a programme of unit pricing in their stores. Following this, there has been extensive research in Canada. I do not wish to weary the Committee with a vast amount of statistics, but it is interesting to highlight one or two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For instance, in response to the question posed by the Consumers' Association in Canada, "Do you think unit pricing is a help to shoppers?", 89 per cent. of those included in the survey replied in the affirmative; 87 per cent. said that they would like to see unit pricing extended to all stores. The 	<i>Co-operative Consumer</i>, which circulates mostly in the prairie provinces, had an even more startling response; 94 per cent. of the respondents were in favour of its extension to all stores. In addition, more than 90 per cent. said that they would be more inclined to shop in a store which used unit pricing than in one which did not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been recent surveys in the United States which have underlined these results. Rather more than half the respondents have seen the unit pricing labels, which have been in the stores for about six months. Nearly all the users said that such labels would be helpful. Other studies in the United States indicated that after a brief period two-thirds of the people who understood the scheme indicated that the labels would be useful. One could quote many similar examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only extensive research that has been done into the cost, which is an important factor, indicates that the smaller stores were at a cost disadvantage. It was estimated that a small store, unaffiliated with any group, would have an annual maintenance cost amounting to 0.35 per cent. of its turnover; in American terms that is about 7 cents on a 20 dollar grocery bill. At the other end of the scale the annual cost for a large chain store could be as low as one-fiftieth of that figure. The costs are based on 4,000 items, but where fewer items are used, the cost falls significantly. This survey, produced
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0444">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
by the Canadian Government, also considered how best unit pricing could be applied. It came down firmly in favour of shelf marking rather than individual package or product marking. That is a lesson that we should take to heart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This one-Clause Bill is purely and simply a piece of enabling legislation and does not specify that certain things must be done. It merely gives my right hon. Friend the power to make orders. These orders in their turn could be discussed with those who would be affected. I hope that my right hon. Friend will be able to give us a helpful and encouraging reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not claim, nor have I ever claimed, that this is an earth-shattering reform which will transform the lot of the shopper overnight and enable her immediately to have value for money wherever she goes. But, as I have said, there is certain information to which the shopper is absolutely entitled. If by introducing unit pricing we can enable the housewife to have even a slightly fairer deal, enable her to make more meaningful comparisons when she goes on her weekly shopping trek, we should think seriously about introducing it. It is for those reasons that I hope that we shall have a favourable reply from my right hon. Friend this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Trade (Mr, Michael Noble)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First I should like to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack), on his success in the Ballot, enabling him to bring this important aspect of consumer protection before the House. He will have noted the useful discussions which have taken place recently in trade and consumer circles, and through the media, about his proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are very much concerned that consumers should be given help to enable them, when shopping, to judge whether they are being offered value for money. We believe that the consumer has a right to know, by one means or another, what he is getting for his money. This is important for foodstuffs and other household goods, which account for a considerable proportion of the weekly family budget, particularly for the less well-off members of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Up until ten years or so ago, this did
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
not present any real problem. Many goods were then still weighed out in front of the customer: the retailer used to indicate the price per pound at which he sold his goods and the consumer was free to place an order for the quantity she required or to take her custom elsewhere if she considered the price too high. There have since been extensive developments in the retailing of food and household goods. An ever-increasing range of products is now sold in pre-packed form, most of the range being put up ready for retail sale by the manufacturer. The housewife has come to accept the advantages of making her own selection from the wide range of packages on the shelf in her local store; this shortens her shopping time, enables the retailer to offer her a wider selection of different varieties or brands of the same product and ensures that the goods reach her in better condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, when goods are no longer on offer at xp per pound, it may prove difficult for the housewife to compare the relative values of different pack sizes of the same product or of the same size but different brands of the same product. As hon. Members are no doubt aware, there is a requirement under the provisions of the Weights and Measures Act, 1963, that many basic foodstuffs such as tea, coffee, sugar, butter, margarine, flour, jam and honey, when pre-packed should be made up only in prescribed rounded quantities, having a simple relationship to each other. Our list of controls has long been more extensive than that effectively imposed in any other country and it is generally accepted that this solution. where it can be applied, is a better one than unit pricing for the consumer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much evidence to show that existing legislative controls on prepackaged goods afford the United Kingdom housewife a far better assurance than her foreign counterparts have of the quantity she receives. In many cases she already buys in prescribed quantities which enables her, in addition, to compare prices easily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members will know from other statements which have been made to the House, the Government are reviewing the operation of these controls and will be ready to extend them to further commodities in suitable cases. Metrication, however, presents a particular case where prescribed quantities will not fully assist
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0445">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
the consumer. During this time when the retail trade is changing to the metric system, it will be unavoidable for imperial and metric packs to be offered for sale together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph 69 of the White Paper on Metrication the Government have made a commitment
	<br><blockquote><p>"to ensure that consumers fully understand the system which is in use and are able to judge value for money during the period when both Imperial and metric measures are in use. It will be the pre-occupation of all concerned to see that consumers do not suffer as a result of the change."</p></blockquote>
Unit pricing is clearly one possible method, but this would certainly result in additional costs to retailers. As my hon. Friend pointed out, a study has been made of them—quite rightly, because one does not want to try to help the consumer by adding to their burdens. We are not certain whether these costs would have much impact on prices, but certainly unit pricing will be carefully examined, not only for its permanent advantages, but in terms of the particular problems which consumers may face during the period of metric change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have to this end approved the setting up by the Metrication Board of a steering committee for distribution and consumer interests to consider and advise on all aspects of the metric change which will have an effect on the consumer. The Board and the Department are now consulting trade and consumer interests on the best practicable means of assisting the shopper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unit pricing should be viewed as an alternative method of facilitating value comparisons. It is a device which is being used, as my hon. Friend said, on an increasing scale to provide more adequate consumer information, particularly in overseas countries which do not have such long or such wide experience of applying prescribed quantity controls as we have in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been argued that the extra work involved in marking and adjusting unit prices would raise costs and discourage shopkeepers from making special offers, or that consumers would be unlikely to make use of the information if it were provided. There is an obvious need to look carefully into these objections, and officials from my Department and from the Ministry of Agriculture are visiting countries employing unit price marking in order to reach an informed view of
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
these problems and of the usefulness of unit pricing to the consumer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Legislation has recently been introduced, as my hon. Friend said, in West Germany, in Switzerland and in a few states in the U.S.A., the effect of which is generally to require the retailer to mark the unit price where the goods are not packed in standard quantities. In the U.S.A. there has also been a strong move towards voluntary unit pricing in the past two years. It has been adopted by major retailers who have access to computer facilities: they invariably indicate unit prices on the shelf labels in the store rather than on the goods themselves. When done on a large enough scale, this limited form of marking adds little to the retailer's cost, but it is generally accepted there that it would be unreasonable to require small retailers to apply the same practice. Indeed, anybody who has experience of them, as I have, knows that there are one or two distinctions to be made between, say, the Scottish village post office and the large supermarket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A campaign for clear price marking was introduced in Sweden on a voluntary basis 18 months ago. Meat, cheese, vegetables and fruit were initially covered and the practice is slowly extending to other goods. Because of the high labour costs which would be involved in continuous checking of the markings on individual packs, where unit pricing is involved, the marking is generally placed on the shelf or on a poster or board nearby.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unit pricing is already being given a limited trial in the United Kingdom. Fine Fare has lately introduced, in association with the Consumers' Association, an experimental unit pricing system into one of its supermarkets at Camden Town. Here the information is printed on the price label on all packs of six commodities in widespread demand. The Government also understand that Sainsburys have introduced unit price marking on their detergents and propose to extend this to a limited range of grocery packs. These voluntary moves have been generally welcomed and we shall certainly continue to watch developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are very sympathetic to the Bill's object—to help consumers. But until the range of inquiries both here and overseas has been completed it is difficult to judge the extent to which the consumer would be likely to benefit from mandatory unit price marking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
	<p>11 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Janet Fookes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say that I am pleased by the rather more sympathetic attitude of the Government to this important matter. I have spent some months peppering the Department with Parliamentary Questions, particularly on prescribed quantities. As far as I can gather from my right hon. Friend's speech, the Government share my view that that is a better way of dealing with the problem than by a universal system of unit pricing. That does not mean that I do not support unit pricing—in that case I should not be standing here now—but I believe that it is appropriate that where goods which can be prepacked, are not prepacked, prescribed quantities are the better method of dealing with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take it that the Government are not to bless the Bill this morning, as I understand the tenor of my hon. Friend's remarks. I am interested in the steering committee to be set up under the Metrication Board. I should be happier if there were some kind of timetable, since this issue should not be allowed to drag on indefinitely. I am disturbed that there is no timetable for the compulsory acceptance of metrication. If we are to move over, we must have a timetable so that everybody can know where he is. I should be happier to go along with the Government if I could have an assurance on a timetable for the studies of consumer protection by unit pricing, especially in connection with metrication.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Bernard Braine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly associate myself with the view expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Merton and Morden (Miss Fookes). It is important when the Government decide not to support a Bill, although they recognise that there is a problem, that they should give some clear indication, not merely as to what they are to do, but as to when they will do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For my sins, I do part of the family shopping at weekends, and I am well aware that making comparisons frustrates and baffles a good many shoppers. I can think of nothing, apart from a general price reduction, that is likely to satisfy the housewife more in her shopping than the clearing away of an arrangement which is manifestly unfair, and in fact deceitful.

I accept what my right hon. Friend has
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
said this morning. The Government clearly believe that the consumer has the right to know whether he or she, is getting value for money. I should be happier if my right hon. Friend were able to say that, after a reasonable period for the experiments which he has mentioned, the study of the problem, committees and so forth, the Government intend to do something about it, and at an early stage.

In view of our imminent entry into Europe, with all the impact that that may have on prices—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Grievous impact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Bernard Braine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not happen to share that view; I happen to think that it will prove a great opportunity, but I readily recognise that it involves considerable adjustments and changes, and it seems sensible that an anomaly such as that which my hon. Friend seeks to remedy should be put right as soon as possible. I hope that my right hon. Friend will be able to say something a little more definite about the timetable for action that he has in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to thank my hon. Friends for their support. I appreciated the enormous trouble to which my right hon. Friend has obviously gone, and the helpful and sympathetic answers that he has given, but I feel that there is substance in what my hon. Friends suggest. Although the Bill, we hope, will see its Committee stage through successfully this morning, we all know that it cannot get further this Session. The pressure on the timetable is such that we cannot get the Bill back to the Floor of the House. The Bill must fall when the Session comes to an end, and we all know and accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I sincerely hope that my right hon. Friend, impressed by the weight of argument this morning, will impress upon his colleagues in the Department the absolute need for a timetable. That is the fundamental consideration on which we all agree. Next Session a similar Private Member's Bill could get through, or the Government could make sure that a code of practice was introduced, or they could brine in a shopper's charter, more embracing than this, to include such things as unit pricing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I completely accept what a right hon. Friend said about the small shop. Just as we have created the sensible situation
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0447">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
with VAT, that where the turnover is below £5,000, a business will not come into the net, we might have a situation whereby the small shops were specifically exempt from a price marking system because of the problems that would arise. We have to be flexible. We must tackle the problem as best we can, but in a way which does not increase costs to the housewife and which does not create more problems than it solves. The problem is there, and it must be tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those words I ask my right hon. Friend for some indication of the timetable, fully accepting that we cannot have a complete and detailed assurance this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do my best to reassure my hon. Friends, but I cannot go much further than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that we are holding the discussions to which I referred. We have already visited a number of countries where unit pricing is working, and I hope that by the end of the year we shall have all the information that we are likely to get in order to make up our minds which method of trying to help the consumer is best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one factor which I should like to draw to the attention of the Committee. The best is often the enemy of the good. There are a number of possible extensions of standard quantities, which is what everybody wants, and we already have the power to take action on them. We do not need any special legislation to do that. We should look seriously at the various problems and try to iron out with the manufacturers the best and fairest way of moving in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coming on to the problems of metrication and the difficulties of comparative costs between grams and ounces; unit pricing will be, if not essential, most useful. Inevitably, that will not be for a year or two. We have asked the Metrication Board to set up special groups to study the problem so that as metrication develops, the Board will be able to advise us what to do about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the Committee that the problem of making things easier for the consumer is very much in the mind of my
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, and there will be no unreasonable delay in trying to get cracking with proposals. However, it would be difficult to say that by 1st January, 1973, or 1974, we can deal with the problem. I would rather say that we shall look at the different bits and deal with them as fast as we can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I should like to thank, too, my right hon. Friend for being so helpful, and we are all agreed that he has been very helpful indeed. My thanks go to the Clerk, too, and to all who have helped in the production of the Bill, and to my hon. Friends, including my friend the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks), without whom we might have been in some difficulty this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extremely difficult at the end of a long and gruelling Session to assemble a quorum for what is, I think, the last Bill in Committee this Session. We were able to do it, and I thank all my hon. Friends for making it possible. That we have conducted our proceedings in just over half an hour and got the Bill through Committee gives me great encouragement for the future, and I trust that consumers throughout the United Kingdom will realise that a small blow has been struck for them today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
