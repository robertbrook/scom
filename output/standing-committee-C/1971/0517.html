	<div class='title'>AMENDMENT OF SECTION 1 OF TRADING REPRESENTATIONS (DISABLED PERSONS) ACT 1958</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Reed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 19, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>cc</i>) after the words "or by post" there were inserted the words "or by telephone";.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the information of the Committee, my selections are available. Amendment No. 1, and Amendment No. 4, relating to the Schedule, in page 3, line 13, after "post", insert "or by telephone", can be discussed together, but Amendment No. 4 will have to be put in its due place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Reed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 1 rectifies an omission in the original Bill as first drafted. It concerns the ways in which firms which exploit disabled people carry out their trade. The Bill originally said that in house-to-house trading or trading by post firms would be unable to claim that they were selling on behalf of disabled people. Since the Bill was published, many firms have been looking for ways of circumventing it. One of these methods is the use of the telephone, since this was not then dealt with. A mafia seems to exist amongst firms exploiting disabled people. They get together quite frequently to discuss their own activities and to find ways of avoiding the law. The Amendment is an attempt to plug another loophole. But although the Amendment, if accepted, will help to do that, no piece of legislation, in itself, will ever prevent
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
these people from seeking other ways of exploiting the public to line their own pockets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two distinct practices in using telephones for sales of this kind. The first is quite simple: a girl is paid to sit in an office with a local telephone directory and work through areas where the directors of the firm think there will be major sales opportunities. The object is to give the salesman a psychological advantage. The tale told over the telephone is, "If you would like to help disabled people, we will arrange for one of our salesmen to call upon you and show you a series of articles made by disabled people. You might like to consider which you want to buy when the salesman arrives."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The telephonic technique gives an extra air of officialdom; the impression given is that it is quite above board and is a genuine attempt to help disabled people. In fact, the firm is trying to give its salesman a foot in the door before he actually comes to the door. He is given a distinct psychological advantage over a potential customer. It is the same technique as that of selling by post or by house-to-house visits. The same shoddy goods are being pushed at the same inflated prices with the object of lining the pockets of the salesmen and of the directors of the firms involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That practice is bad enough, but there is a worse practice which also uses telephone sales. It is the use of the telephone actually to solicit orders for goods. Somebody sits in an office, telephoning people and claiming perhaps to represent "the office of the disabled", some meaningless but official-sounding title. In this case, the salesman describes the goods, and then asks for an order to be placed by the householder or person concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What makes this practice really despicable is that quite often a request is made for cash to be sent before the goods are delivered. The rogues in this business, by not delivering the goods, completely destroy all the good work of the reputable organisations which try to help disabled people. People, having sent off a cheque or postal order for goods which they think will provide money to help disabled people, receive nothing. Not only is this obviously a disgusting sales technique practice, but it spreads a great deal of public disquiet about the whole business of helping disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0304">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
I am very grateful to the Town Clerk of Sheffield who, through his official organisation, raised this question. He has said that his office has been beleaguered by people in Sheffield who have been conned by this type of sales method. They have rung up the local authority thinking that an official sales technique was being used and that they would have some redress through the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the Amendment, therefore, is to deal, together with house-to-house sales and sales by post, with yet another loophole and technique which these firms are using. I do not think, whatever we do, that we shall eventually be able completely to stop the absolute rogues exploiting the public, but the Amendment and the extension of the Bill's provisions would make it just a little more difficult for them to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Weitzman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate my hon. Friend's reason for the Amendment, but I suggest to him that it might have been much simpler to have left out
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the course of visits from house to house, or by post"</p></blockquote>
—in other words, the representations to be made, which really implies "to be made in any way whatever". That would cover any possible loophole. Perhaps my hon. Friend will consider it at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Dudley Smith)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without taking legal advice, I hesitate to answer in detail the point raised by the hon. and learned Member for Stoke Newington and Hackney, North (Mr. Weitzman). It is important that this provision should be as precise as possible, and there is probably something to be gained by the definitions which will be inserted if the Amendment is carried. I will look at the point, and so, I am sure, will the hon. Member the sponsor of the Bill in case this improves the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member the sponsor of the Bill that, however hard we try, we shall probably not be able to circumvent the activities of all those rogues who wish to exploit disabled people, but it behoves us to make this legislation as watertight as possible. He is right to propose the inclusion of the use of the telephone as an illegal way of soliciting business, and certainly the Government support the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in the end bound by the legal interpretation of the Measure, and I should like to know how the telephone procedure can be made illegal. Surely, there would be some difficulty in producing the necessary evidence when a conversation takes place on a telephone and there is no independent witness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dudley Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that; it is an important point and I shall deal with it. As the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. David Reed) said, traders who tout for business by this method were outside the scope of the 1958 Act, which applied only to representations which were made in the course of house-to-house visits or by post. The Amendment was suggested by the Sheffield local authority after it received many protests from the public that a firm which was registered under the 1958 Act was, by means of unsolicited telephone calls, causing a great deal of trouble among the residents in the Sheffield area. One of the most alarming things about it was that in the course of these calls they said that they represented the "office of disabled persons" which, presumably, referred either to the local authority or, more likely, to the Department of Employment which made this register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As was said on Second Reading, a large number of people who have been involved in this activity take unto themselves a spurious identity with a Government Department in implying that because they are registered, their activities are officially recognised in what they are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By attempting to eliminate canvassing of this sort by telephone, we can at least help to reduce the excesses which occur. The Amendment has the support of the Association of Municipal Corporations, but, as the hon. Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. Leadbitter) said, it will be difficult to enforce; the provisions will be even more difficult to enforce than those relating to canvassing or by post. In the end, the onus really comes back on the individual householder, the person who is canvassed, to make complaints about it. My hope—and I am sure it is also the hope of the sponsor—is that it will act as a further deterrent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, we cannot go to extremes and have a great policing force to stamp out this abuse which, although serious and unpleasant, is reasonably narrowly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0305">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
defined. Therefore, we have to rely on the good sense of the public. The essence of the matter is that people should know that it will no longer be permissible for anybody, other than the well-defined charitable organisations, to canvass on behalf of disabled people, even though they may be quite genuine and the goods supplied have been made by disabled people. As we have said all along, it is wrong that there should be trading on the sympathies of the public on behalf of disabled people, which can so easily lead to exploitation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot assure the hon. Member for The Hartlepools that this measure will be anything like 100 per cent. effective; it will not. I am certain that telephonic communication will still be tried by the rogues, but at least if this provision is written into the Bill we shall have a better chance of getting it across to the public that this sort of activity is not permitted, of getting representations made where it occurs, and of taking action against those who are involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this Bill becomes an Act, I hope that one of the things which will stem from it will be more prosecutions. Since the initiation of the 1958 Act, as I said on Second Reading, only two prosecutions have taken place—a pitifully small number, showing that the Act has not worked properly. If only we could get a few more, perhaps they would act as a deterrent to those people who seek to abuse the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is taken for granted on both sides of the Committee, I think, that the objectives of my hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield (Mr. David Reed) are clear, distinct and desirable. However, a hard fact of life is that the original Act has been a complete failure in dealing with the problem. Considering that there have been only two prosecutions, against the background of the growth of these practices, the original Act clearly has not done its work. Although my hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield is doing a remarkable public service in proposing this and the following Amendments, nevertheless it is right and proper that we should be realistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said "If this becomes an Act of Parliament", and, of
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
course, time is running desperately short. But that does not minimise the problem brought to the attention of the House by my hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield. We are going through these procedures and recognising, as practical men in a realistic situation, the immensity of the problem, but it is not sufficient in the end to place the onus upon the sufferer to bring evidence to the authorities in order that action shall be taken. It is imperative that the Government realise that it is high time they brought in their own legislation to deal effectively with the situation. Meanwhile, my hon. Friend is doing his level best to deal with the problem by calling upon public opinion as well as calling the attention of the House to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter should be considered in three parts. First, it is wrong to assert that a Bill of this kind, amended, can be successful. The evidence of the earlier legislation shows this not to be the case against the background of the grow-up of the practices. Second, the likelihood of the Bill becoming an Act is not a certainty, because time is running short.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Third, therefore, if the timetable is such that the Bill cannot be enacted, ineffective as it might be to deal with the unscrupulous practices of people in the trade, the Government should indicate their willingness to use their powers in another way. In other words, rather than relying on evidence which might be difficult to obtain by means of a Bill like this, the Government should find ways and means of enforcing a different kind of law to compel traders of any kind to register with the authorities; in some cases to seek a licence from the local authority or in other cases to register with the Department in order that they may be seen to be legitimate tradespeople.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will take note of that important point. Whilst the addition of the words "or by telephone" is an improvement, in hard practical experience it is unlikely to be as successful as would be the case if the Government indicated that they would take upon themselves powers should the Bill not be enacted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weitzman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend's fears are unfounded. I understand from the Minister that the Government are making every effort to assist in seeing that the Bill becomes an Act of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0306">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Parliament as soon as possible. Personally, I see no danger in that respect. However, I am anxious that the wording should be made as watertight as possible and I suggested the omission of words, further consideration might be given to applying this provision to representations made "in any case whatever".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those words would cover any possible case where evidence could be shown that such representations had been made. For example, representation might possibly be made by a course of conduct without any words actually being stated. Those words would cover any case where evidence could be brought that representations were made by post, telephone, course of conduct, in writing, or otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Reed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I briefly try to answer some of the points raised by my hon. Friends. I accept immediately that there will be difficulty of enforcement whatever legislation is passed. When people are in business simply to make as much money as they can as quickly as they can by exploiting as many people as they can, enforcement will be difficult. Nevertheless, even by debating the matter, irrespective of whether the Bill becomes an Act, we are doing our duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the Second Reading debate, I have received many hundreds of letters from different parts of the country from people who have, over the years, bought goods from salesmen of this sort and who were not aware that the profits from these sales would not help disabled people but go into the pockets of the sharks. So from this point of view, our debates have been valuable and of service to the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty about achieving a form of words that would tie the whole thing up is that there is no wish on the part of any member of the Committee to make life difficult for the worth while organisations which may at some stage want to sell door-to-door. There are few—I know of only one—reputable organisations working on behalf of disabled people which use sales techniques other than those which call upon the public voluntarily to go into a different room or building and actually purchase something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, one of the difficulties in tightening the form of words is that to do so might make life difficult for those organisations which we would all want to help. But certainly it is well worth while looking at it again, because there
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
are opportunities at each stage to change things round in order to enable the Bill to achieve its purpose. For that reason I will see whether at a later stage it is possible to take account of this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dudley Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One point I did not make is that for the call to be effective the telephone caller must give his address. This immediately pinpoints him if a complaint is made. There is still the difficulty of getting the original complaint from the affected person, but I am sure that it will be agreed that if an address has to be given, it is well worth while including telephones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we are to add the words "or by telephone" I hope that the definition of "telephone" will be wide enough, because there are now so many new gadgets associated with the electronic system. An example is the Telex. The sort of rascals from whom the Bill is trying to protect the public probably would not have a Telex, but it is possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many business houses use a Telex. Although on the one hand we are trying to protect housewives and disabled people, the Telex could be a way by which a sophisticated rogue could get at big business and make a real killing. I do not want to make a big thing of it, but it is worth bearing in mind that the use of the word "telephone" is narrow. Perhaps before Report the hon. Member could think of some omnibus phrase which would include Telex and other gadgets. I understand that one such gadget enables one to pop one's telephone in a little black box, the chap the other end pops his telephone in a little black box and documents can then be pushed down the line by some extraordinary means. I am hazy about this gadget but it is widely used in business houses. I know that my right hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Mr. du Cann) has a number of these gadgets in his commercial office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such gadgets or instruments exist. Will the hon. Member note their existence, and perhaps put down an Amendment on Report. One does not wish to jeopardise this important Bill in any way, but I should be most grateful if he could look at this point again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dudley Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to burden the Committee again, but in view of the comments of the hon. and learned
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0307">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Member for Stoke Newington and Hackney, North (Mr. Weitzman), I thought it wise to take some legal advice. I am told that it is important to keep the words "house to house" in the Bill; otherwise selling from a shop would be stopped. "House to house" should remain and the extra definitions are, therefore, necessary. I take the hon. and learned Member's point; it is an attractive one, but for the sake of clarity and to get it exactly right, it is important to include these words. We could, with ingenuity, think of other forms of communication, but 99.9 per cent. of all possible eventualities are covered. In these circumstances, I hope that the Committee will support the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lewis Carter-Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that there are various forms of communication by telephone. The phrase "telephonic communication" would cover them all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Sedge-field (Mr. David Reed) and the Under-Secretary can take heart from the fact that usually action is brought not in the isolated case but after a multiplication of instances. For this reason the phrase "house to house" must be retained. In the end people start asking, "Is this reputable?" and then they have redress with the local authority. I ask my hon. Friend not to worry unduly about the isolated case. It is the large number of cases with which we are concerned, and they will filter through from individuals to the local authority, which can then take the appropriate action. My hon. Friend's Bill provides this protection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Reed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 2, in page 2, line 6, leave out paragraph (	<i>a</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this Amendment we shall take Amendment No. 5, in Schedule, page 3, line 24, leave out "is
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
registered under the Charities Act 1960, or".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Reed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment is an attempt to tighten further the provisions of the original Measure. In line 18 onwards of the Schedule there is a list of organisations and legislation under which the organisations are registered, such organisations being exempt from the new provisions of the amended legislation. It is an attempt to enable any worth while organisation which wanted to conduct sales on a door-to-door basis, or by whatever means, to continue to do so and not be subject to the penalties in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amongst the legislation listed there, including the War Charities Act, the National Assistance Act and the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act, there are many means of registration and checking by central Government and by local authorities to make sure that the organisations concerned are worth while.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the 1958 Act, there has been further legislation of that nature, the Charities Act, 1960. It was originally thought that including exemptions for organisations registered under that Act would be a further means of enabling any worthwhile organisation to continue whatever sales activity it might want, at the same time making life difficult for the rogues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, that turned out not to be the case, and the Amendment is at the request of the Charity Commissioners who have looked at the Bill and have seen that, rather than making life easier for the reputable organisation, just the opposite is happening—that including a reference to the Charities Act would make life easier for the rogues whom we are all trying to put out of business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a misapprehension that I, and I think many other people, suffered from, that registration under the 1960 Act somehow guaranteed respectability, that the Charity Commissioners would be able to vet thoroughly and check any organisation on its register to make absolutely certain that it was reputable, worth while, and that its directors were not gaining too large a remuneration. That is not so. I believe the only criterion that the Charity Commissioners can use is to find out whether the objects of any particular organisation seeking to register with them
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0308">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
are charitable at law. Provided that an organisation can meet that requirement, there is little that the Commissioners can do to make sure that their objectives are being met and that the organisation is not diverting money that comes in to different uses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one realises that already more than 78,000 organisations are registered with the Commission, it is possible to see how difficult it would be for them to police even further registrations which might result from the Bill. So, simply by including the Charities Act, as in the original Bill, rather than providing a further check, we would be creating a loophole in the Bill. All sorts of organisations might be able somehow to adopt a constitution which would satisfy the criteria which the Charity Commissioners are forced to use, then continue to conduct the type of sales practice which the Bill is designed to stamp out. If their constitution was charitable in form, that is as far as the Charity Commissioners themselves are allowed to check.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know perfectly well, because of the mafia of traders to which I referred earlier, that this is one of the means of circumventing the Bill. One of the largest firms operating in this field has already let it be known—for what reason I do not know—that it was looking at ways of registering itself as a charity in order to continue the practice. In that case, less than one-third of the sale price of any goods concerned ever reaches disabled people, and if it is possible for them to continue that sort of practice after the Bill becomes an Act, it will be rather pointless to continue the exercise. This is designed to block one other loophole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may be worried that, by taking out this reference to the Charity Commission, other legislation might not adequately cover the question of worth while organisations and allow them to continue. Any organisation which employs disabled people, if it is a charity, is obliged to register not only with the Charity Commission under the Charities Act, but also, under the National Assistance Act, 1948, with a local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at the National Assistance Act, 1948 in detail, it seems that under that legislation the local authority has far more control over charitable organisations registered with it than the Charity Commissioners have under the 1960 Act.
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
So there would be quite strong powers which local authorities could use, if they wished, to vet any organisation claiming to employ disabled people to make sure that it was completely worth while. The 1948 Act would not be affected in any way by this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was looking at previous debates, including one in the House of Lords last year on this subject, and was quite pleased to find that a large number of local authorities were already instituting an inquiry into charities registered with them under the terms of the 1948 Act, to make sure that they were worth while.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to mention one organisation which has written to all the sponsors of the Bill, and perhaps to other hon. Members as well, and that is Mr. Peter Spencer of Mouth and Foot Painting Artists Limited. This is an ideal case in point. It is, as far as I understand it, an entirely worth while organisation employing disabled people, and it is concerned that the legislation that we are debating today may alter its constitution and perhaps force it out of business. It could, if it wished, register under different legislation and continue its business because, as a firm composed of disabled people producing goods by their own labour, it would be exempt from the penalties in the Bill. Therefore, Peter Spencer's organisation would be able to continue its activities, as would many similar organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am satisfied that by deleting this reference to the Charities Act, no worth while organisation of which I am aware would be prevented from continuing a form of sales activity which it continues at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for giving way. I did not want to interrupt, but it would be convenient to do so while he is on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking Mr. Peter's Spencer's organisation merely as an example, the hon. Member quite rightly said that the self-employed disabled are exempt from registration, but he also said that they "could" register under other legislation. Would the hon. Member be kind enough to expand on that and explain what legislation; and, secondly, will he say whether there would be any cost to these people? Would the legislation under which he is suggesting they might register put any financial burden on associations of men and women
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0309">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
working together, such as Mr. Peter Spencer's organisation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Reed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far as I am aware, in answer to the hon. Member for Maidstone (Mr. John Wells), there would be no financial penalty involved. I will check to make absolutely certain, but, so far as I am aware, that is the case. If a firm employs disabled people, it is already obliged to register, under the National Assistance Act, 1948, with a local authority unless that local authority itself decides to exempt it from registration. I should not think that a firm like this, composed of disabled people, would find it difficult to register if it wanted that degree of respectability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not think that even this would matter, because according to the specific words of the Bill, if disabled people are producing goods for sale by their own labour, they will continue to be able to make representations, house to house or by post, provided that they are disabled people making their own goods for sale by their own labour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of the sanctions in the Bill is to make life difficult for the sort of firm where disabled people are employed simply to enable the claim to be made that the profits are going to help the disabled. In this case, the disabled people are usually doing little more than packing shoddy goods in polythene bags. Consequently, I doubt whether, under the terms of other sections of the Bill, Mr. Peter Spencer's organisation would find itself in any sort of difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object is to try to close as many of the loopholes as possible. What we hoped originally would have been an extra sanction upon the real rogues and sharks has turned out to open a loophole. The purpose of the Amendment is to close that up once again and make it difficult for them. One would hope that by doing that we could direct the public's genuine willingness to help disabled people into worth while channels and towards more worth while organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dudley Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a number of notes to explain the position, but the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. David Reed) has done it so well and in such detail that I need not weary the Committee with a long exposition of the situation. On the face of it, it seems desirable
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
that these words should be included, but, as he says, the Charity Commission advised us that this is not so and, as a consequence, the Committee would be well advised to support the hon. Member in his Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If these words were retained, it would enable any spurious body of any description to slip through, provided that it managed to adopt a constitution which was exclusively charitable in form. Such a body need not even include as one of its objectives the relief of the disabled but could include a charity established for public purposes or for the advancement of education or religion. Provided that such a body employed or benefited one or two disabled persons, it could make representations to that effect, although the amount of employment or benefit might well be minimal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member said, rogues are usually plausible people and they will be looking for ways, if they wish to, to circumvent the Measure. We need to draw it as tightly as possible and obviously here, quite innocuously, the hon. Member presented a situation whereby they could quite easily, by a certain amount of machination, get round it. I think he is sensible to take the advice tendered by the Charity Commission and, from the Government's point of view, I recommend that the Committee should accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dudley Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that these are mainly drafting Amendments and were suggested by my Department to put the Bill in order.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>, That Clause 1, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weirzman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little troubled by one point to which I referred during the debate on Second Reading. In Clause 1(2,	<i>c</i>) the words are
	<br><blockquote><p>"… produced … by his own labour."</p></blockquote>
Quite rightly, the sponsor of the Bill has seen that as an exemption in the case of a disabled person who produces the goods himself. Are not those words too limited? Do they mean actually produced by his own working, or may he employ anyone else?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not tried to see whether the words could be extended, and I appreciate that if they were extended it might open the gates to a good deal of abuse. On the other hand, does the hon. Gentleman think that there is any way to extend them? The case might arise of a disabled person, with the assistance of one or two other persons, producing certain goods. It seems a little iniquitous if, as a result, he is to be debarred. Perhaps consideration could be given to that aspect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Reed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In answer to my hon. and learned Friend, perhaps I may ask: debarred from what? The Bill seeks to allow representations to be made in certain ways only by reputable, worth while organisations helping disabled people. It does not in any way affect any group of people setting up their own company to produce any sort of goods in their own way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the form of words might be improved, and I shall certainly see whether that is the case. But the Bill would not prevent, say, two or three disabled people and possibly some able-bodied people getting together to produce goods and selling them however they wanted, provided that the goods were produced by disabled people using their own labour or using other sales methods. For
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
example, many people produce goods in their own homes and sell to friends and relatives. There is nothing whatever in the Bill to prevent them from doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I will certainly have a look at the form of words. I understood that this form of words was necessary in order to tighten up the 1958 legislation which allowed almost anyone to drive a coach and horses through it. Simply by having one disabled person anywhere around their organisation they were able to make these representations. I understand that the form of words is not as seems to be feared, and that there would be nothing to prevent all those worth while organisations. But, to be absolutely certain, I will undertake to look at this point again very closely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

how business should progress through the House and I should be wrong to do so, but there appears to be every reason to hope that the Bill is making satisfactory progress towards the Statute Book.
