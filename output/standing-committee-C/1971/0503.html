<p><i>Resolved:</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That if the proceedings on the Matrimonial Proceedings (Polygamous Marriages) Bill are not completed at this day's Sitting the Committee do meet on Wednesday next at half-past Ten o'clock.—[<i>Mr. Sandelson.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
MATRIMONIAL RELIEF AND DECLARATIONS OF VALIDITY IN RESPECT OF POLYGAMOUS MARRIAGES: ENGLAND AND WALES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neville Sandelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 20, after "1970", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"or the Divorce Reform Act 1969".</p></blockquote>
I shall deal first with the paragraph as at present drafted, briefly explaining its scope, and the reason for the proposed Amendment.<br><br>
The paragraph deals with ancillary relief. Since the rule in Hyde v. Hyde precludes parties to polygamous marriages from the principal forms of matrimonial relief, the question of ancillary relief has not hitherto arisen. In most cases, the right to ancillary relief depends upon a decree being granted, but this is not necessarily so.<br><br>
Paragraph (<i>e</i>) makes clear that in future parties to polygamous marriages will be entitled to apply for all forms of ancillary relief available in matrimonial proceedings under the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1965 or the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act, 1970. These forms of relief include orders under the 1970 Act for financial provision on a decree of divorce, nullity, or judicial separation for the parties to the marriage and the children of the family, and orders for the variation, discharge and enforcements of orders under Sections 1, 4, 6 and 14 of the same Act. They also include orders under Section 18 of the same Act for the custody of and access to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
children, and orders under the 1965 Act for maintenance from the estate of a former spouse.<br><br>
Paragraph (e) refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"… a power exercisable in connection with, or in connection with proceedings for, any such decree of order …"</p></blockquote>
thereby ensuring that it covers not only ancillary orders made after a decree but also orders that can be made before the decree is granted. Orders that can be made before the decree is granted are of the nature of maintenance pending suit, under Section 1 of the 1970 Act, or an interim order made on an application under Section 6 of that Act. The matter is, of course, dealt with to some extent in the Law Commission Report.<br><br>
Having explained the scope of the paragraph, I shall now explain my reasons for inserting this reference to the additional Act, the Divorce Reform Act, 1969. This is a technical Amendment, designed to ensure that paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>e</i>) of subsection (2) cover matrimonial relief of all kinds. The particular matter that I have drawn to the attention of hon. Members arises from Section 5 of the Divorce Reform Act, 1969 which provides for the rescission of a decree of divorce, granted on the basis of two years' separation and the respondent's consent to the decree—this being a ground for divorce under that recent Act—if the respondent was misled on any matter material to the giving of consent for the purposes of obtaining that decree in the first place. To remove any doubt, this provision should be specifically included in the interpretation of "matrimonial relief". The Amendment so provides by adding a reference to the 1969 Act in paragraph (<i>e</i>) of the subsection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General (Sir Geoffrey Howe)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to detain the Committee. However, since the Second Reading of the Bill lasted for three minutes, perhaps I may take the opportunity of extending to the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Sandelson) the congratulations of the Committee on his wisdom in adopting this Bill. I also thank the Law Commission and those who assisted in undertaking the work of making this legislation possible in this form.<br><br>
The Committee might also wish me to extend congratulations and a word of

thanks to the noble mother of the hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) whom we are pleased to see here, exercising a filial duty in respect of legislation which was discussed in another place as a result of the noble Lady's initiative. I commend the Amendment to the Committee.</span></p>

Clause 3</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
AMENDMENT OF S. 1 OF NULLITY OF MARRIAGE ACT, 1971</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sandelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 2, in page 3, line 14, after "a", insert "polygamous".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be for the convenience of the Committee if the following Amendments are also taken:</span></p>
<p>Amendment No. 3, in page 3, line 15, leave out:
<br><blockquote><p>"under a law which permits polygamy".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>Amendment No. 4, in line 17, after "Wales", inseryt:
<br><blockquote><p>For the purposes of paragraph (<i>d</i>) of this section a marriage may be polygamous although at its inception neither party has any spouse additional to the other.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sandelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to you, Mr. Brewis, and to the right hon. Gentleman for his kind remarks and reference to those who have played a major role in the production and presentation of this Measure.<br><br>
These Amendments are designed to remove doubts which have been expressed as to the possible effect of Clause as drafted. It has been suggested that the new paragraph (<i>d</i>) to be inserted in Section 1 of the Nullity of Marriage Act, 1971 might, as drafted, invalidate a Christian marriage celebrated between persons of English domicile in a country whose legal system recognises polygamy. Those who make the suggestion concede that although doubt might arise the courts would be unlikely to put so wide a construction on the phrase "entered into under a law which permits polygamy". However, the matter is too important to be left to chance and the possibility of misconstruction in the courts.<br><br>
Therefore, the first two Amendments re-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
move any possibility of doubt by ensuring that the new paragraph (<i>d</i>) relates specifically to a polygamous marriage and cannot refer to any other type of marriage which may have been entered into in another country.<br><br>
The third Amendment explains that the expression "polygamous marriage" covers both actual and potential polygamy, so there should be no doubt on that score either.<br><br>
These Amendments remove any fear that the courts might be driven to regard a marriage as potentially polygamous by the words "a law which permits polygamy" in circumstances where they would not now do so. It is impossible to define a potentially polygamous marriage, because the circumstances in which one party is permitted to take another spouse vary widely under different systems of law. Up to now the English courts have successfully dealt with each case on its own facts and decided whether the marriage was monogamous or polygamous.<br><br>
I cite the case of Mehtar <i>v</i>. Mehtar as an example of what I wish to draw to the Committee's attention in this respect. This marriage was celebrated in accordance with the rights of a particular sect of Hindu religion which practised monogamy. The majority of Hindu sects permit polygamy. Expert evidence showed that if the parties changed their religion subsequent to the marriage the marriage might have become polygamous. For example, if, as in this case, the husband, having entered into a monogamous marriage with his wife according to the practices of that particular Hindu sect, had then changed his faith to a different Hindu sect which permitted polygamy, the marriage might become polygamous. In fact, the court held that the marriage was monogamous and the point was taken by the judge, Mr. Justice Barnard, that what he had to concern himself with was the status of the marriage at its inception, and not what might happen <i>in future</i>—in the remote event of a change of faith which might convert a person from a member of a faith practising monogamy into one permitting polygamy.<br><br>
It would be unfortunate if the courts were to be influenced by the remote possibility that a marriage might be converted into a polygamous one.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
The effect of the Amendment therefore
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0287">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
is to make it clear beyond doubt that the Clause relates only to polygamous marriages, actual or potential, and to leave the courts free, as at present, to determine on the facts whether a marriage is polygamous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee is grateful to the hon. Member for his lucid explanation of the Amendments. They are certainly necessary to avoid the risk of the provision as drafted being incorrectly construed.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Further Amendments made:</i></p>
<p>No. 3, in page 3, line 15, leave out "under a law which permits polygamy".</p>
<p>No. 4, in line 17, after "Wales", insert:
<br><blockquote><p>For the purposes of paragraph (<i>d</i>) of this section a marriage may be polygamous although at its inception neither party has any spouse additional to the other.—[<i>Mr. Sandelson.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Question proposed</i>, That Clause 3, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. E. S. Bishop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be unworthy of me if I did not say a few words, but not worthy if I said more.<br><br>
Comments have already been made by my hon. Friend and the Solicitor-General, and reference has been made to the course of this Measure through another place. As a sponsor of the Measure I am pleased to support my hon. Friend. After Baroness Summerskill introduced her Bill last year I was concerned that the Measure might have no future. Consequently, I wrote to the Lord Chancellor asking whether more could be done to reinstate it. I felt that it was a Measure that should have been introduced by the Government, and not left to a private Member. The Lord Chancellor, however, thought it more appropriate to a private Member, and hoped that I might find someone to pursue it. My hon. Friend has done so on his own initiative.<br><br>
Some of us were concerned to read, in my hon. Friend's article in <i>The Times</i> of 19th January, of the rather bizarre comments that by the introduction of the Measure it was intended to encourage polygamy. What we are seeking to do is to regularise the situation, especially in view of the number of immigrants in the country at present.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
Paragraph 38 of the Law Commission Report No. 42 adequately summarises the position. I should not like it to be thought that as members of the Committee, speeding the Bill through to its conclusion, we are in favour of some of the irregularities that prevail in other countries. Paragraph 38 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Finally, it is rightly argued that immigrants to England are not in a privileged position and are expected to conform to English standards of behaviour. However, it seems to us that parties to polygamous marriages are more likely to conform to English standards if English law imposes on them, so far as is practicable, the same family rights and obligations as are imposed on other married people. The denial of all relief cannot achieve any change in the standards of behaviour of people who have made their home in England. On the contrary, denial of relief not only permits parties to escape from their obligations, lawfully entered into under another legal system, but tends to perpetuate the polygamous situation because the marriage cannot be ended".</p></blockquote>
That sums up the feelings of my hon. Friend and those of us who are associated with him in this endeavour. We feel that the immigrant woman in this country should be entitled to the same rights as other women, and not necessarily be made to share a husband with another woman. It is also extremely welcome that the Divorce Reform Act and the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act, with other forms of relief, should apply in this situation.<br><br>
With those few comments of welcome for the Bill, I again pay tribute to the Law Commission for its work, under Mr. Justice Scarman, and to the Government for their co-operation, without whose benign support such Measures could not go through. The Bill is a move in the right direction. It is another step in tidying up some of the irregularities which exist in the present matrimonial law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a sense, this is an occasion when we are all extending thanks and courtesies to one another, but I should like to add one word to what the hon. Member for Newark (Mr. Bishop) said. He has played a notable part in modernising and tidying up this aspect of the law. However, it is important to understand, as the hon. Gentleman said, that we are not doing anything to encourage, multiply or foster polygamy. The point was put with characteristic clarity by my noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor on 9th July, 1971,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0288">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
when he said in justification of another Bill:
<br><blockquote><p>"It certainly would be an odd thing if only polygamous marriages remained indissoluble in English law, however cruelly or badly the wife was treated. It would be an odd thing if the only 'wife' who could not get her so-called freedom was the wife who by Christian standards had never been a wife at all".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>House of Lords</i>, 9th July, 1971; Vol. 321, <i>c.</i> 1223.]</p></blockquote>
It is in that direction that the Bill seeks to go. Once again, the Bill has the good fortune to be sponsored by my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Dame Joan Vickers). I am also glad to see that she has the support of my hon. Friend the Member for Rochester and Chatham (Mrs. Fenner), who is an extremely useful recruit to this kind of activity. I would not wish, therefore, to leave out my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Wimbledon (Mr. Havers)—learning and femininity go well together in support of a Measure of this kind.</span></p>

SHORT TITLE, INTERPRETATION AND EXTENT</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed</i>, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we take leave of Clause 4, I should like to ask the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Sandelson) and also my right hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General a question regarding subsection (3). I do so in no desire to raise difficulties at this stage or to delay the passage of the Bill.<br><br>
I want, first, to congratulate the hon. Gentleman on legislating so constructively so early in his career in this House.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newark (Mr. Bishop) spoke of bizarre comments about the Bill, and I notice that the Lord Bishop of Lichfield was a little anxious in another place lest it appeared in the Press that he welcomed polygamy. I am also anxious that no one should say in the Press, or anywhere else, that RCMP welcomes polygamy. However, the Bill does nothing to undermine what the Lord Bishop called marriage as it is understood in Christendom. I should like to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
amend that in respect of the hon. Gentleman and his community and say that the Bill does nothing to undermine the Judaic-Christian concept of marriage. The Bill seeks to bring relief to individuals and also to the taxpayer.<br><br>
I hope that that digression has given the hon. Gentleman and the Solicitor-General time to address themselves to my question, which is this: why should not the Bill extend to Northern Ireland? This Imperial Parliament is now the only effective legislature for the Six Counties. I consider it a constitutional outrage that we should be expected to pass in this House complex and controversial Measures of deep concern to the people of Northern Ireland by Statutory Instrument, without the possibility of amendment. Surely it is better to make laws for the United Kingdom, or any part of it, by proper Act of Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sandelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Member for Chigwell (Mr. Biggs-Davison) for having raised a point of obvious contemporary importance and relevance. As I understand it, we have never been concerned with Northern Ireland legislation. Northern Ireland has its own Director of Law Reform and until recently had its own powers to enact its own Measures of family law. However, the hon. Gentleman has brought to the attention of the Committee a matter of considerable current importance, and I have no hesitation in taking advantage of the presence here today of the Solicitor-General, who can speak with obvious authority on the point raised by the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept with as much enthusiasm as I am able the baton that has been passed to me by the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Sandelson), having started its career round the Committee with my hon. Friend the Member for Chigwell (Mr. Biggs-Davison).<br><br>
As has already been stated, family law is part of the law of Northern Ireland. It has normally been regarded as a transferred matter, subject to the control of the Parliament of Northern Ireland. Without pretending any detailed knowledge of the family law of Northern Ireland, I am confident that it is significantly different from the law of England, Wales and Scotland. It might be difficult
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0289">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
to graft the concept embodied in the Bill upon the existing Northern Ireland law. It is, of course, being done with regard to Scottish law, but only after consultation with the Scottish Law Commission. As the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington said, Northern Ireland has its own Director of Law Reform, who is in a position to consider this matter in the context of the Northern Ireland scene and to put forward proposals.<br><br>
The Bill is a Private Member's Bill. There must have been other Private Members' Bills passing through Parliament since the Northern Ireland legislation enacted before Easter, but I do not think that any of those other Bills purported to deal with Northern Irish domestic law by virtue of a Private Member's Bill going through the House. The Committee may feel that that is the right way in which to approach the matter at this time, especially on a subject of this sort.<br><br>
It would not be right for me to comment on the wider points raised by my hon. Friend. I know his view about the consequences of the recent changes in Northern Ireland and he knows the alternatives open to this Parliament to legislate for Northern Ireland. He referred to the order in council procedure as the one he has in mind. He might feel that it would be difficult to draft a Private Member's Bill into that kind of procedure.<br><br>
At this stage I cannot go beyond explaining the difference between the Bill before us and the kind of Measure my hon. Friend has in mind. I shall refer his point to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland so that he may consider, not so much this specific point, but the general implications of the mattter.</span></p>

but for having done their homework. Having studied the subject and done their homework, I know that hon. Members have appreciated the social significance of the Measure. Their co-operation has assisted the smooth passage of the Bill through Committee and I thank them for their help.<br><br>
Foremost in my mind at this stage is Lady Summerskill, to whom tribute has already been paid. Well-merited tribute was paid to Lady Summerskill by her colleagues in the other place last July, after she had made a brilliant contribution to the understanding of all concerned on the subject which we have been considering today. I think it proper to say that should this Measure reach the Statute Book, it will be Lady Summerskill's name, and her work as initiator and prime mover of the Measure, that will be remembered in connection with it.<br><br>
I should like to express a particular debt of gratitude to the Law Commission, but more personally and directly to those in the Lord Chancellor's Department who have shown me great courtesy and extended to me all the assistance for which a new and still raw Member could possibly have hoped, in presenting the Measure. I am grateful to all the staff of that Department, headed in this instance by Mr. Widdows. I am equally grateful to the Clerk of the Committee, Mr. Ryle, for the great assistance he too has given to me in explaining the procedural matters that might have to be dealt with today. I refer also to the draftsmen of the Bill. I feel sure that all hon. Members are aware of the debt owed to them by all of us for the services they render.<br><br>
Having done a certain amount of homework on the Measure, I now somewhat regret the absence of any fireworks. The Committee might perhaps have been more memorable if there had been one or two "bangers" and a few squibs let off, of the damp variety or otherwise. However, I make no serious complaint about their absence and the smooth passage of the Bill to Report.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Bill, as amended, to be reported.</i></p>
<p><i>Committee rose at four minutes past Eleven o'clock.</i></p>
