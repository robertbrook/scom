	<br><q><p>"That during the proceedings on the Night Assemblies Bill the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock."—[	<i>Mr. Wiggin.</i>]</p></q></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are accepting the principle of Sitting on Wednesday mornings at this stage, but I think we ought to make it clear, because of the activity now going on the Floor of the House on Tuesdays and Wednesdays of each week in respect of the European Communities Bill and the possibility of late night Sittings on Tuesdays that it may be necessary to move a further Sittings Motion if we find this in any way impeding our ability to apply ourselves constructively to this Bill at 10.30 on Wednesday mornings. With that slight warning note we would not wish to prolong the debate on the Sittings Motion on this occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><q><p>"That during the proceedings on the Night Assemblies Bill the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock."</p></q></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we proceed I would like to give the usual formal notice and call attention to the fact that adequate notice should be given of Amendments. As a general rule I do not propose to call manuscript Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the convenience of the Committee I have circulated a full list of the provisional selection of Amendments. I think all hon. Members have copies. This will give Members an opportunity to discuss amongst themselves various Amendments which have been selected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->

	<div class='title'>RESTRICTIONS ON LARGE NIGHT ASSEMBLIES IN OPEN AIR</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the first selected Amendment, No. 1, I propose that we take Amendments No. 2 in page 1, line 5, after "event", insert:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
	<br><q><p>"conducted for commercial purposes and for intended profit";</p></q>
No. 46, in line 9, at end insert:
	<br><q><p>"Provided that if any number of persons gather in the open air for a purpose which is authorised by paragraphs 4, 5 or 6 of Schedule 1 to the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960 it shall not be deemed to be a night assembly."</p></q>
—this is a reprint of the previous Amendment No. 6;
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No. 25 in Clause 2, page 2, line 36, leave out subsection (5);
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Clause 1—(	<i>Exemptions</i>):
	<br><q><p>"(1) Where an organisation whose activities are carried on otherwise than for profit and are not confined to any part of England and Wales satisfies the Secretary of State—
	<ol>
	<li>that its objects include the encouragement or promotion of recreational activities; and</li>
	<li>that night assemblies in pursuance of arrangements made by it have been held over a substantial period; and</li>
	<li>that those night assemblies have been conducted in a proper and considerate manner and have not resulted in any danger to public health or public safety;</li></ol>
the Secretary of State may grant to the organisation a certificate of exemption.
	<ol>
	<li>Where such a certificate of exemption has been granted to an organisation and is in force sections 1 to 3 of this Act shall not apply in relation to a night assembly which is held in pursuance of arrangements made by that organisation for a meeting for its members and which does not last more than five days.</li>
	<li>The Secretary of State may at any time withdraw a certificate granted by him under this section."</li></ol></p></q>
Incidentally, among the Amendments on the Paper there is a starred Amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes), No. 40, in page 1, line 5, leave out "an" and insert "a musical", which we can discuss with this group of Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that we will be able to have separate Divisions on Amendment No. 46 and the new Clause 1 if required?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will be in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 1 in page 1, line 5, after "event", insert "conducted for commercial profit".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These I believe are very important Amendments because they give us an opportunity of clarifying the purpose of this Bill. For some of us here today this is in the nature of a reunion. We were associated with the debate on the Isle of Wight
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0119">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
Bill which went through the House last Session. I spoke on that occasion and expressed sympathy with the problems of the Isle of Wight authorities over the pop festival, and my complaint at that time was that, probably through an excessive anxiety to economise, a lot of extraneous material had been thrown into the Bill. On this occasion we have a Bill which is rather wider in scope than was originally intended and I hope through these Amendments to draw attention to this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think we are all conscious that this Bill has had a good deal of publicity. Talking to a young man this morning whom I regard as my own "litmus paper" as he is a pretty representative chap, I asked, "What do you know about the Night Assemblies Bill?" He said, "It is a Bill to stop pop festivals". I asked, "Do you really feel that?" He said, "Well, it is to make them so difficult that in fact they will not take place". He said he regarded this Bill as an appalling infringement of the liberty of young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that all hon. Members of the Committee will have had representations and criticisms of this Bill by means of private letters and through the Press. I draw attention to the letter in the 	<i>The Times</i>, 21st February, 1972, from Terence Griffin, who wrote:
	<br><q><p>"Because of ambiguous phrasing what has started as an enlightened attempt to enforce public hygiene has become a dangerous attack on civil liberty."</p></q>
It is to try to improve this point that I have submitted my Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the last day or two hon. Members will have received a submisison from the National Council for Civil Liberties in which it draws attention to its genuine fears about this Bill. I do not propose to go through the objections in detail. I am sure that in discussion with critics of this Bill it has become recognised by hon. Members that there is a need for proper facilities for large assemblies such as pop festivals. This has been recognised and accepted. We also recognise Mr. Griffin's comment that this is to some extent an enlightened attempt to enforce public hygiene. The criticisms of the National Council for Civil Liberties are not easily dsposed of hon. Members will remember that in its submission it itemised a number of things which would fall within the scope of this Bill. Talking about assem-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
blies, it gave examples of a trade union rally, all night vigil, charity walk, protest demonstration or march.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of the restriction of the right of assembly and its relation to traditional civil liberties was raised on Second Reading of the Isle of Wight Bill by the hon. Member for Barking (Mr. Driberg) who gave a number of examples, many now hallowed in traditional history, of the right of assembly which would be impeded by legislation like this; and during the Second Reading of this Bill the hon. Member for West Ham, North (Mr. Arthur Lewis) voiced the same sort of fears. Although the Second Reading debate was not too long these fears were raised at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering the right of assembly which I am seeking to protect through this Amendment I have done a little research, and I believe that there are narrow legal definitions of the right of assembly which are quite unsatisfactory. I quote from S. A. de Smith's "Constitutional and Administrative Law", page 485:
	<br><q><p>"The general rule that meetings on highways are trespasses is derived from private law. It gives no weight to the public interest in freedom of expression and the time is ripe for reconsideration by the courts."</p></q>
I believe that this very narrow legal definition of the right of assembly is one which is kept in the cupboard and trotted out from time to time to suit a particular occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend not agree that that is only concerned with the right of assembly on highways? This Bill takes it much further and to the right to assemble on private land?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. Friend. He is a legally trained Member and I look forward to hearing from him at greater length on this point. I believe that this is a very narrow point concerned, as my hon. Friend says, only with highways, and we have in this country developed over a long period of time a right of assembly which is a very precious thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Going further into researches in preparation for this Committee, Mr. Wallace, I came across a former Home Secretary, Sir John Gilmour, talking about the right of holding peaceful meetings and processions as one of the most cherished rights, and he said:
	<br><q><p>"If this right were abused in such a way as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0120">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
to lead to grave disorder and public disturbance, the Government would have to ask Parliament for further powers."</p></q>
My submission is that no such conditions have developed in relation to civil liberty expressions, and that, therefore, we should not attempt to curb them in any way in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we look at the general context of legislation regarding the right of assembly and civil rghts over the international field we find that something which we have taken for granted in this country for many years is now being underwritten by various international bodies. The same authority I have already quoted mentions the United Nations Charter and Article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights saying,
	<br><q><p>"Everyone has a right to the freedom of peaceful assembly and association."</p></q>
This dates back to 10th December, 1948. Since 1953 the United Kingdom has been a party to the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Here again this lays down that
	<br><q><p>"Everyone has the right to freedom of assembly and freedom of association".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Maddan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman read paragraph 2 of Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights? Or perhaps it would be convenient if I read it quickly:
	<br><q><p>"No restrictions shall be placed on the exercise of the rights except such as are described and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedom of others."</p></q>
A very good statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Maddan). He is anticipating that I am going to speak for a long time and he has saved me the trouble of dealing with the second part of this. I fully take the point he has made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to the right which we have expressed we are often told now, in the current political climate, that our European friends would be aghast if we rejected the opportunity to enter the European Community which is now offered to us. I think they would be aghast if we wrote into legislation anything which could be seen as impinging on this traditional right of assembly.

A more recent example from the international field—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is getting very close to a Second Reading speech.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate your remarks from the Chair, Mr. Wallace, and I will now address myself specifically to the substance of the Amendment. I will not transgress along the path of the hon. Member for Deptford because if he has the opportunity to catch your eye, Mr. Wallace, he will speak to the Committee himself—I apologise for the slip of the tongue—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member probably thinks he is in another Committee at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most obliged for your sympathy and understanding, Mr. Wallace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ithink my hon. Friend is accustomed to sitting behind my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) and inadvertently confused the two of us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for these explanations. May we now get on with the Amendments, please?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Wallace. The point of restricting night assemblies for commercial profit is to rule out from the Clause all those items which come under the traditional rights of assembly. The whole point of the demonstrations and protests which may fall into this category is their spontaneity. It is not possible, as pointed out by the National Council, to plan months in advance against spontaneous demonstrations against something which has aroused
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0121">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
public feeling and indignation. This is the answer to the hon. Member for Hove who brought up the question of paragraph 2. It is not possible to plan months in advance for the sort of crisis we had at the time of Suez, the sort of demonstration which may occur when a large section of the community feels that the Government have acted in an outrageous and unjustified manner. This Amendment, to restrict the Clause to assemblies for commercial profit, is to try to clear away these objections from the point of view of civil liberties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our existing right of assembly, although it may not be very much used, is an important safety valve in our society, and it would be most unfortunate if, in trying to deal with another and acknowledged problem, we do something which is unjustified. So I would ask the promoter of the Bill to consider this Amendment and to accept, if not the wording of it, then at least the spirit of it. I am quite prepared to accept that, in my clumsy way, I may not have drafted the Amendment to the complete satisfaction of those who want to produce a good piece of legislation, but I cannot believe that it is in the real interests of our country if we are seen to be eroding a substantial part of our traditional civil rights because we are afraid that we cannot draft a Bill sufficiently closely to catch the people who may wish to promote these festivals for profit. So I ask the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) to accept the spirit of the Amendment even if he is not happy with the wording of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An article appeared in the 	<i>Daily Mirror</i> which Members, I am sure, will have read, which referred to what is known as the generation gap. It is true that there is a feeling abroad that older people are somewhat out of touch with younger people. It would be a great pity if we did anything which would be seen as possibly exacerbating this feeling that we do not understand the younger generation. So I ask the hon. Gentleman to be seized with the purpose of this Amendment to restrict the Clause to assemblies for commercial profit. I believe that this would remove at a stroke—a rather overworked phrase—the civil liberties objections, and we could get down to the task of producing a Measure aimed at protecting younger people from exploitation by unscrupulous promoters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want first of all to say that there are in the United Kingdom a large number of bodies which have for a considerable period of time availed themselves of recreational facilities in the open air, have conducted themselves in an entirely satisfactory manner, and have as a result been awarded a certificate of exemption under the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960, by the Secretary of State. The Clause as drafted will bring all those bodies within the provisions of this Bill, and will inflct grave injustice upon responsible, sensible law-abiding bodies which have shown by their behaviour that they are worthy of the confidence which has been placed in them by the issue of the certificate of exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it would be right for the promoters of the Bill, and indeed for the Committee itself, to be fully aware of the nature and size of those bodies which at present enjoy exemption, and which will be caught in the net of this Clause as drafted. There is the Caravan Club, a highly popular body which organises facilities for those who wish to avail themselves of caravanning. There is the Camping Club of Great Britain and Ireland, a body which has been in operation for well over seventy years, which was the forerunner of organised outside camping activities, which has shown itself to be a body of immense responsibility, which has given full co-operation to the Department and has participated in the Department of the Environment's working party on camping and outdoor enjoyment, and which is very much respected in the whole field of outdoor recreational facilities. It tells me that, if the Clause as at present drafted were to be enacted, it would set the club back not ninety years but to the Dark Ages, because, despite the fact that it is a responsible body, it would be completely without any protection from a local authority, which decided that it did not want to have tenters in its area, and it could be banned and prohibited. I am sure the Committee will agree that that would be an outrage, and that my Amendment ought to be accepted to safeguard the club.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the Boy Scouts Association and the Girl Guides Association, both bodies which hold a certificate of exemption from the Secretary of State. They, too, are entitled to continue to receive that exemption from any provisions which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0122">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
might be imposed by a further Act. There is also the Motor Caravanners Club, the Caravan Mission to Village Children and the Caravan Tourist Association. Those bodies are exempt from paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of Schedule 1 to the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be right, in discussing my Amendment, that the Committee should be fully aware of the precise terms of those paragraphs, because it is upon our understanding of the paragraphs that hon. Members will make up their minds on how they vote for the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 1 to the 1960 Act deals with cases where licences shall not be required under that Act, and paragraph 4 states that
	<br><q><p>"… a site licence shall not be required for the use as a caravan site of land which is occupied by an organisation which holds for the time being a certificate of exemption granted under paragraph 12 of this Schedule (hereinafter referred to as an exempted organisation) if the use is for purposes of recreation and is under the supervision of the organisation."</p></q>
All those bodies which I have mentioned comply with that paragraph.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not weary the Committee with all the sub-paragraphs in paragraph 5, except to say that they go on to specify the types and requirements of exemption. There is a further body of people who are exempt by paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 to the 1960 Act. It states:
	<br><q><p>"Subject to the provisions of paragraph 13 of this Schedule, a site licence shall not be required for the use of land as a caravan site if the use is under the supervision of an exempted organisation and is in pursuance of arrangements made by that organisation for a meeting for its members lasting not more than five days."</p></q>
Under that paragraph, there is a large number of bodies with a certificate of exemption from the Secretary of State, and they will not be caught within the ambit of Clause 1 as at present drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I shall not go into details of each organisation, the Committee should know the breadth of the organisations involved. There is the Cheltenham Owners Club, the Safari Caravan Club, the Rover Owners Club, the Sprite Club, the Tompson Owners Club, the Stirling Owners Club, the Auto Camping Club, the Castle-ton Owners Club, the Carlight Owners Club, the Services Caravan Club, the Bessacarr Owners Club, the Civil Service Motoring Association, Rotary Inter-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
national Caravanning Fellowship, the Knowles Owners Club, the Carmel Caravanners Club, the Vauxhall Motors Caravan Camping Club, the Ace Owners Club, the Eccles Caravan Owners Club, the Viking Fibreline Caravan Club, the Trailer Caravan Club, the Buccaneer Owners Club, the Fairford Caravan Owners Club and the Baptist Caravan Fellowship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will be pleased to know, Mr. Wallace, that that has exhausted my list of exemptions under the Act. I read it out because I believe it is absolutely necessary that we should all be aware of how wide, how loose and how sloppy this Bill really is, and what an attack it could be upon our civil liberties if it were allowed to go through unamended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have listened with interest to that list of organisations which the hon. Gentleman has read out, but perhaps he could enlighten the Committee as to how many of them, and how frequently, hold night assemblies which would fall within the ambit of this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be delighted to tell the hon. Gentleman that the Camping Club of Great Britain and Ireland and the Caravan Club hold very frequent assemblies which, particularly in the view of the Camping Club of Great Britain and Ireland, would fall within the provisions of the Clause. With regard to those organisations in the list which I read out, of course I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman how many of them hold regular assemblies which would fall within the provisions of the Clause. All I know is that if they wished to hold just one overnight assembly at one weekend they would fall within the provisions of this Clause. Therefore, they would be suffering the disadvantage of having removed from them an exemption which has been conferred upon them by the Secretary of State under powers voted by Parliament. That is a serious issue and one of which the Committee must take very careful note.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.00 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would also refer to the fact that, on the Second Reading of this Bill, the Minister for the Local Government and Development said that he would be in favour of relieving organisations of that sort from the burden of this Bill. If they are to be relieved from that burden, then
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0123">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
it is my submission that that can best be done by accepting Amendment No. 46, which puts them all back precisely into the position which they now enjoy and completely relieves them from any other liabilities which may be put upon them by this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman the Member for Weston-Super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) has a new Clause on exemptions. The trouble with that new Clause, first of all, is that subsection (1) states:
	<br><q><p>"Where an organisation whose activities are carried on otherwise than for profit and are not confined to any part of England and Wales satisfies the Secretary of State"</p></q>
and then goes on to the criteria. Those organisations whose names I have read out to the Committee, and which at this moment enjoy exemption, are not necessarily all organisations which are not confined to any part of England or Wales. Indeed, I am advised that some of those organisations which are exempt are localised organisations and, under the wording of the new Clause, we should not be removing the burden of this Bill as was promised by the Secretary of State. So on that ground alone the hon. Gentleman's new Clause is inferior to the Amendment which stands in my name, and in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, subsection (1) (	<i>b</i>) of the new Clause states
	<br><q><p>"that night assemblies in pursuance of arrangements made by it have been held over a substantial period".</p></q>
That would mean that the Secretary of State would have to determine what is a substantial period. Would it include a body which has had the benefit of exemption since the 1960 Act came into operation, but has met only rarely? I dare say that the Baptist Caravan Fellowship would not be able to hold regular weekend meets, because of the religious worship in which their members regularly indulge at weekends. It might be confined to one caravan meet in the year. It is incumbent upon the hon. Gentleman the Member for Weston-super-Mare to tell us whether an organisation holding only one meet a year would qualify under paragraph (	<i>b</i>), whch uses the words "over a substantial period."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the criterion? Is it two years, five years or ten years? The Committee really must know. I am also concerned that, because of the wording of the new
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
Clause, it would be very difficult indeed for new bodies to obtain the exemption which he offers them. I believe that the new Clause is far too restrictive and does not relieve the existing exempt organisations from the burden of the Bill, as was promised by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, when the Committee has fully discussed these matters, I hope that it will choose Amendment No. 46 in preference to New Clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is all I wish to say at this stage on my own Amendment, but I should like to offer a few words to my hon. Friend who moved Amendment No. 1, which seeks to insert the words "conducted for commercial profit." One of the gravest apprehensions which we have about this Bill, and about this Clause in particular, is that it would be a grave threat to the civil liberties of this country. The Bill has vast implications and goes far beyond the control of other night assemblies, some of which have caused difficulty in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one—certainly not the Press—is under any misapprehension that this Bill, and this Clause, are directed at a small group of young people who have found a new form of entertainment. You will recall in your youth, Mr. Wallace, and I certainly recall in my youth, doing many things of which our elders disapproved. I can remember wearing 22-inch bottoms to my trousers, and wearing a slouch hat after the Cagney style. I can remember the disapproval which was showered upon me by those set in authority over me, by my own parents—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Member confine his remarks to his own sordid past and not bring the Chair into it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I would not trespass upon your good offices, Mr. Wallace, in discussing your past, for reasons which both you and I fully understand. We have known each other—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Gentleman kindly keep to the Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, Mr. Wallace. As I was saying, my own past—and I am sure the past of most of us—involved entering into activities and pastimes, modes of dress, appearance and language which received the disapproval
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0124">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
of our elders. Young people today, who are involving themselves in this new phenomenon of pop festivals, are doing nothing different from that which we ourselves in our various manners have done in our own time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference, which I am sure somebody will point out to the Committee, is that it is claimed that our odd activities did not impose an unfair burden upon other people, and did not infringe the rights of others. That may be so, but the hon. Gentleman the Member for Weston-super-Mare will recall that, in the area which he has the honour to represent in the House, on 26th March, 1882, a body which is now a highly respectable body, the Salvation Army, was engaged in some difficulties with the local population in establishing its right to proceed through the streets and to hold open-air religious meetings in order that they might encourage the population of Weston-super-Mare to enter upon more godly occupations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend would not wish to mislead the Committee in any way. When he said that the Salvation Army is now a respectable body, he was surely not suggesting that it was not a responsible body then? The position then was that people did not think it a respectable body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am indebted to my hon. Friend for bringing me back to tighter language and avoiding casting an unnecessary imputation upon the Salvation Army. All bodies which follow the Christian faith are respectable bodies. Of course the Salvation Army is and was and will continue to be a highly respectable body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I am trying to make is that 90 years ago almost to the day the people of Weston-super-Mare decided that the Salvation Army was a body which was indulging in practices which were unacceptable to them. It was daring to carry the message of Christianity and salvation into the streets and to preach the Gospel of God to the people of Weston-super-Mare. The result was that two justices of the peace signed a notice prohibiting their assembly and there was a famous court case. From that has been established certain rights in respect of the passage to and from and along the Queen's highway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not without significance that 90
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
years later it should be the hon. Member representing that area who should be presenting this Bill which is again designed to inflict restrictions upon people indulging in a new form of enterprise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In order to defend my constituents, even of 90 years ago, could I ask the hon. Member to complete the story? The reason that the justices requested the Salvation Army not to meet was that the "bovver boys" of those days, known as the "skeleton army," proceeded to cause a riot every time the Salvation Army appeared. It could well be that the case he refers to is relevant in the light of what we are discussing, and it is perhaps possible to draw the reverse conclusion from that case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have the volume here with the details of Beatty v. Gill-bank case in it. The hon. Member is correct in saying the skeleton army tried to stop the Salvation Army from marching, but the analogy I would draw is that he is the skeleton army of 1972. He is endeavouring to stop young people from enjoying themselves in a new way, a way which, perhaps, we do not necessarily wish to participate in or approve of. For me the sound of loud music with incomprehensible words is wholly alien. I like to hear not only sweet music but the words as well. If I were to attend a pop festival I would not find it to my satisfaction any more than my parents found 22-inch bottoms to my trousers to their satisfaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 	<i>Daily Telegraph</i> yesterday, in an editorial, put into words the real thoughts and motives behind the Bill. I know the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare to be quite sincere in what he is setting out to do, and I do not necessarily accuse him personally of being motivated precisely along these lines, but certainly the irrational, unthinking support in the country is based upon the criteria set out in the 	<i>Daily Telegraph.</i> It says:
	<br><q><p>"What do these pop festivals mean? They mean that a horde of strangers, usually of alien and uncouth and sometimes of terrifying appearance and habits, descends on some small village outnumbering its inhabitants perhaps some 500 times over. They mean a stentorian noise, to many vulgar and hateful, spreading night and day over a wide area. They mean serious risks of fire, disease and pollution."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is reading a quotation at length and embarking upon a Second Reading

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
speech. He must return to the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendments are to remove from the Bill not only those organisations exempt under the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act but those assemblies not conducted for commercial profit. If we succeed in getting Amendment No. 1 accepted we will remove many of the infringements of our civil liberties which we fear may come as a result of the Bill. It is for that reason that I am deploying the argument that this is a serious attack upon our civil liberties and that it is an irrational attack based upon an irrational thought process by some members of the public and perhaps some hon. Members of the Committee. If the commercial profit Amendment is accepted it means we would exempt organisations which are not out to exploit those attending the festivals or to give trouble to the local authorities. We will be dealing with the people who participate in a new development in our life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reading from that editorial I am suggesting that the allegations upon which the Bill is founded are based upon a complete misunderstanding and a sense of hysteria against the new generation which is among us and which will one day inherit this nation from us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Isle of Wight three festivals were held over a period of two or three years. Only one, the second one, created serious difficulties in as much as the promoters failed to provide sufficient facilities and to co-operate adequately with the local authority. I cannot find evidence that festival activities, conducted for profit or not, have on the whole degenerated into disorder. There has been the odd one. I have found, whether they have been for profit or not, that the local people have naturally had reservations and apprehensions, but those apprehensions are based on a misunderstanding of young people. They really believe and are fanned into believing that young people are the alien and uncouth people referred to in the 	<i>Daily Telegraph.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Woodnutt) will be aware of the papers submitted to the Royal Society of Health in 1971 in which Mr. L. H. Baines, Clerk to the County Council, set out very clearly that the im-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
pact upon the people there was not as severe as the Press made out and that many of the incidents occurred well away from the site and that on the whole it was a problem of trying to get with the promoters an agreement which would be satisfactory in dealing with these matters. It is our submission that if Amendment No. 1 were accepted it would go a long way to removing many of the fears we have in respect of civil liberties. It is necessary for Parliament to make it quite clear that we repudiate this irrational fear of youth which seems to motivate so much of the thinking associated with the Bill. I believe, and the evidence supports me, that young people can go into the countryside, behave themselves, enjoy themselves, and confer benefits upon the local community. If we do not amend this Bill we will be inflicting a terrible injury on civil liberties, and therefore I hope my hon. Friends, and hon. Members opposite, will join us in supporting this Amendment to try to ensure that that does not happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Crouch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved) rather spoilt his argument when he moved away from the Amendments and began to talk about possible legislation against young people and the things they like to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
His amendment is to do with specifics. In Amendment No. 46 he is asking the Committee to tighten the Bill in some respects. I think that Amendment has the effect of producing what I would call less good legislation within the Bill. To tighten it in a specific way and to make specific reference to detailed organisations in the camping and caravanning world would be wrong. We all know that well-established caravanning and camping club organisations are often those which are not categorised and could not be categorised and by and large are well conducted assemblies. It is true that they are not often very large assemblies. It would be wrong to separate this section of community activity for particular exemption in this case because the Bill is clearly not designed to restrict the activities of campers and caravanners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is to do with the new phenomenon in our lives known as the pop festival and one which I think the majority of this Committee is not against. I am not against pop festivals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would agree that the Bill is designed to deal with the new phenomenon of the pop festival, but the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) does not agree, because there is not in the Bill one word about pop festivals. We accept that there are difficulties and that there is a need for sensible co-operation between local authorities and the festival promoters, but this Bill is out to ban pop festivals, and in so doing would inflict grave damage on civil liberties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crouch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all respect the hon. Member's concern that we should not restrict civil liberties and human rights, no one more so than myself, but one of the difficulties is to define what a pop festival is. All we talk about is what arises out of pop festivals. We are not concerned with the style of music. It could be Beethoven's Ninth Symphony or the latest form of modern music categorised as pop. It is not the duty of this Committee to argue for or against the type of music. All we are concerned with is that that music, amplified in a certain way, should not constitute a nuisance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Member saying seriously to the Committee that he and his hon. Friends and the Department of the Environment and the civil servants who are used to drafting Bills are between them incapable of putting forward a reasonable definition of a pop festival when the whole Bill is aimed at pop festivals? What a disgraceful state of affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crouch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not able to comment on the activities of the Government and civil servants. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have endeavoured to do that with a starred Amendment. That Amendment would insert the word "musical," whether Beethoven or pop. If the promoters of the Bill have designs only on pop festivals and not other assemblies, that would be a perfectly acceptable Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crouch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the hon. Member is seeking to protect other assemblies which may be conducted for religious or political purposes. No one in this Committee is seeking to put restrictions on civil liberties. All we are saying is that society has a right to protect itself against unwanted nuisance. The unwanted nuisance we are talking about is that which arises inevitably when large numbers of people get together for a long period of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one joins a crowd of 100,000 people at Wembley one is only there for two or three hours. One stands under proper conditions and in safety and there are proper exists and entrances. Such places are designed for large numbers of people. Parliament, the public and the Press are continually on the watch to see that this sort of assembly is conducted in a safe manner, and the rights and civil liberties of all persons are properly protected. When we see a disaster such as happened at Ibrox Park in Glasgow, and even the potential disaster as nearly occurred at Highbury, when a barrier broke, there is an immediate public outcry.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is getting involved with Clause 2.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crouch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Wallace, and of course will observe that Ruling. I sought only to make a short observation because I thought the hon. Member for Erith and Crayford was wrong. He knows from the consultations he has had with my colleagues and me that we have every sympathy with his concern for campers and caravanners and that we would like to see the Bill tightened in this respect so that it did not limit these people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to some of the general criticism of the hon. Member for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson) about the drafting, I would say that new Clause 1 is more effective and more generous in its protection of our civil liberties because it does not separate and specify particular caravanners and campers but rather it allows a great many more organisations to be exempt.

(Mr. Michael Cocks) made a very constructive contribution. He did not suggest that the Committee was trying to produce legislation which was in any way directed against the new phenomenon of pop festivals and the way in which young people, and not always so young people, but many people who are not necessarily young, enjoy pop festivals. I have been to one pop festival and enjoyed it. It was admittedly a small one, but I took my wife and two children who liked it. My son has been to three major pop festivals and has always enjoyed the music, but has not recently enjoyed the conditions under which he has to listen to that music.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a copy of the 	<i>New Musical Express</i> of 26th February with a number of comments by leading figures in the pop musical world. Some are directed against this Bill, but even those strongly critical of the Bill, without having necessarily studied it, show some understanding. This is relevant to this group of Amendments. Tony Ashton says:
	<br><q><p>"If I lived in a small village I'd not suppose I'd fancy a large Festival in my back garden. I sympathise with that. But if a Festival is run properly it's up to the organisers as responsible people to find a suitable site away from the rest of the public and have sufficient facilities to keep music fans within the Festival grounds."</p></q>
I go along with that. It is a responsible comment. Then there is Mr. Keith Emerson, although I do not suppose he is always used to that formal title. Keith Emerson says:
	<br><q><p>"Reasonable legislation to control Festival conditions is O.K."</p></q>
Rod Argent says:
	<br><q><p>"The right effect could have been achieved by making promoters submit detailed plans to conform with specified standards for each Festival."</p></q>
I commend these quotations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We agree a great deal with the hon. Gentleman that reasonable conditions are required, and we hope later to be suggesting what are the reasonable conditions, but we believe that those conditions can be obtained by the normal process of voluntary co-operation and that they do not require legislation as restrictive as this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crouch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not consider the legislation is so restrictive, and there has been more understanding of the Bill since the Second Reading. It may be that later
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
we shall still further improve it. The House has never failed to listen to fair comment and criticism and all the comment and criticism put to it from members of the public, constituents and the Press with a view to improving legislation, and that is what my hon. Friend has done in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 1 would not strengthen the Bill. It would weaken it. It would produce a remarkably large and easy loophole for promoters of a large assembly to conduct their affairs without restraint and restriction. At once they could claim that the organisation and festival they were running was not run for a profit. Anyone could cook the books.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many festivals have not made a profit, and that has been one of the problems. Someone else has been left to pick up the bill at the end. To make such a wide exemption would greatly weaken this Bill. So I strongly recommend the Committee to reject it, and other Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Woodnutt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept at once the spirit in which the Amendment has been moved and agree that we must do something to exclude specific organisations such as those the hon. Gentlemen opposite have mentioned. A lot has been said about the intention of this Bill being to ban pop festivals and not just to control them. I have denied that so often that I am fed up with denying it. Clearly, the Bill is to impose some sort of conditions which decent people would accept and expect. There is no question here of generation gaps and no question of not wanting people to meet for what they want, within the law. We must agree that there must be some sort of regulation, especially for standards of hygiene and sanitation, and I would have thought pop fans would expect it. I know that most do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a question of sorting out the Amendments to see which clearly exempt the sort of organisations which we wish to exempt and to make certain that unscrupulous promoters do not use any of the Amendments to get through the net. Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 do not achieve what their sponsors want to achieve. If they did I would support them. This is a question of definition. What is commercial profit? What are commercial purposes? And there are those words, "intended profit."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be some commercial motive

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
somewhere. There is always a catering establishment and there are barrow boys selling hot dogs. They are not doing it for fun and they are making a profit, like the recording companies making records and the film units. Who is to say that any pop festival can be for other than commercial purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think the hon. Members are achieving what they want, and even if they are, they are providing for the utterly unscrupulous people who organise these things to take advantage and make as much as they can out of them, and put in as few facilities as possible so as to increase private gain. These people announce that they are not doing this for commercial profit and that they will give the profits to charity. Who is to make certain that they do what they say? I do not like the first two Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then here is Amendment No. 46 with which I find myself much more in sympathy because it is more specific and sets out the organisations such as the Boy Scouts, the Caravan Club, the Campers Club and the Showmen's Guild and excludes those whom we wish to exclude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately the hon. Member is not correct on the Showmen's Guild. It comes under paragraph 10 of Schedule 1 to the Act. By an oversight I omitted it. I shall be returning to that later in order to include the Showmen's Guild.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodnott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for putting me clear because I wish to support him in excluding travelling showmen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have obviously given thought to the problems of the Showmen's Guild, but it is extremely unlikely that any fairground would want to operate late at night or with the number of people which would bring it within the Bill. If the hon. Member has evidence of difficulty I should like to look at it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodnutt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem for travelling showmen is that when they arrive at a show ground they stay more than 24 hours, and, as I understand it, this is not a question of operating, of people performing or of music being played, but just a question of gathering. Whatever the conditions, they certainly need full sanitary facilities, and travelling showmen,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
when there are more than 1,000 people, should be excluded, but we have to make certain the Amendment excludes them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Nottingham Goose Fair nearly always has more than 1,000 people and, in the view of the Showmen's Guild of Great Britain, would fall within the provisions of the Bill as drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodnutt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am entirely with the hon. Gentleman. We all want this and it would be easy to get the position clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I like Amendment No. 46 subject to one point on which the Minister could possibly help us. I would like to be sure that this would not make a loophole for the promoters to arrange, by use of those covered by paras 4, 5, 6 of the Schedule, to organise a festival for a vast number and getting through the net in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the new Clause, I appreciate all the work my hon. Friend put in to try to cover these points, but I do not think he covers them, and I feel disinclined to support him for the reason that the hon. Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved) has given, that it is too restrictive. Subsection (1) (	<i>b</i>),
	<br><q><p>"that night assemblies in pursuance of arrangements made by it have been held over a substantial period"</p></q>
rules out new people coming along.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. My hon. Friend must accept that a new organisation would have to comply with the terms of the Bill till it has been conducting night assemblies for a substantial period. It merely means they will have to comply with the terms of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodnutt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be so, but it is a more cumbersome way of achieving this than the Amendment by the hon. Member for Erith and Crayford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is little between us here, and we all want to achieve the same thing. If we cannot resolve the problem satisfactorily today, the hon. Member could look at this with a view to putting another Amendment down on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Crouch) say that he had attended a pop festival. I am sure he has, unlike, as I understand it, the sponsor of the Bill. All in the House respect him very much and will find it a little odd that he, on the

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think they saw the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Crouch).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crouch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would point out to the Committee, particularly to the hon. Member for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson), that since I was reported in the Press as having said that I was not against pop festivals I have had one constituent who says he is regularly praying for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: His constituent may be praying for the hon. Member but not for the people of "alien and uncouth and terrifying appearance."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right to mention that particularly deplorable leader because it indicates the prejudicial terms in which the youngsters who attend pop festivals are dealt with. It should be said here and now—I am not straying out of order, Mr. Wallace—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am watching very carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can see that from the corner of my eye. An overwhelming majority of youngsters who go to pop festivals are normal youngsters from normal, decent homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodnutt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Member suggesting that any of us are disputing that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am suggesting that many people would dispute it because of the terms in which pop festivals are spoken of. The inevitable impression given about pop festivals is that they are—and I will not use the 	<i>Daily Telegraph</i> language—attended by long-haired, bearded freaks with 22-inch trousers, drug addicts, and the like. I am bound to make this a passing observation because I do not want to stray out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is. We are dealing with exemptions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, and it is exactly what I intend to get on to now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would first have liked to have heard the sponsor of the Bill say whether or
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
not he will accept the moderate and sensible Amendment moved by my hon. Friend on the equally moderate and sensible Amendment No. 2 in my name, because I understand the object of this Bill—the sponsors have said this over and over again—is to protect those who attend pop festivals and those local residents who would be affected by such events organised by unscrupulous fly-by-night operators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over and over again in debates in the House and on television the sponsors and supporters of the Bill have said that the object is to deal with fly-by-night operaters. In other words, the Bill is aimed against exploitation by commercial interests. I have never heard any attack made on the way other assemblies have been conducted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that this appallingly drafted Bill will affect every legal assembly held for more than three hours after midnight with more than 1,000 people attending, whether in connection with music, entertainment, or pop music, or whether for commercial motives or purposes. I am astonished and appalled at the cavalier way the sponsor is prepared to bring into the ambit of the Bill all sorts of innocent, decent, and well-conducted assemblies, and he has not gone any way towards meeting the objections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Member suggest the large numbers of assemblies he refers to, caught by my Bill, which have been held in the last 10 years? I find it difficult to think of any.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I will deal with that, but the hon. Member will have to wait a little longer for me to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every organisation which wants to hold a political rally during the hours mentioned in the Bill would be affected. People who go on political rallies or demonstrations do not need to be protected from unscrupulous fly-by-night operators. The people promoting their assemblies are not fly-by-night people. They are responsible trade unionists or responsible people with serious political purposes, but they would be affected by a Bill whose limited object is to deal with the new phenonomen of pop festivals. For instance, workers coming out after a night shift at a factory might want to raise a sudden grievance and call a meeting attended by 1,000 people. We cannot say,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0130">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
"No, you are not to have 1,000; 999 can come, but not 1,000." If their meeting lasted for more than three hours they would be caught by the provisions of this Bill. In answer to the hon. Gentleman's request, I might mention that night shift meetings of that size have been held frequently in recent years, yet they will be caught by the provisions of this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new Clause would go no way to dealing with that occurrence. It says:
	<br><q><p>"Where an organisation whose activities are carried on otherwise than for profit and are not confined to any part of England and Wales satisfies the Secretary of State—(a) that its objects include the encouragement or promotion of recreational activities …"</p></q>
A meeting called by shop stewards could not be deemed to be called by a body whose objects include the encouragement or promotion of recreational activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if my hon. Friend would be interested in this. I have received correspondence from a constituent who participates in all-night praper vigils of more than 1,000 people in the open. They believe that they would be caught by this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is significant that Mr. Alan Booth, director of Christian Aid— and I quote from 	<i>The Guardian</i>—claims that
	<br><q><p>"some charity-sponsored walks, vigils, and weekend feasts could be in jeopardy if the Night Assemblies Bill now in Committee stage comes into law."</p></q>
He has his fears, and no one, I am sure, would make any imputation against the way in which Christian Aid has organised any rallies or meetings or demonstrations. Christian Aid is not alone. All sorts of charitable organisations hold all-night walks, vigils and sit-outs. Does the hon. Gentleman want to intervene?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crouch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not intending to interrupt. I was nodding in some agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman. There are all sorts of other activities which could be caught by the Bill as it is at present drafted, and any subsequent Bill which would include the new Clause. What about New Year's Eve gatherings—coming outside at one o'clock in the morning, coming out from
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
a dance hall and assembling for jollifications? They would be caught if they went on for more than three hours. That could not come under the hon. Gentleman's new Clause. Suppose that after the next election, as most of us on this side will have occasion to do, we feel like celebrating and that that went on for more than three hours—we could be caught by the provisions of the Bill. There is nothing in the hon. Gentleman's new clause to exempt that. All I can say is that the hon. Gentleman's supporters are very lucky that this Bill was not enacted before June last year, as many of them would have been caught by its provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we are celebrating that great and inevitable occasion it will not be just 1,000 people; there will be millions of people in the open celebrating our return to power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentlemen have seen a copy of today's 	<i>Spectator.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crouch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never read it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the trouble with you enlightened people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hugh MacPherson in his political commentary refers to the fears which Vic Feather has expressed, and, with your permission, Mr. Wallace, I could read out a paragraph. Referring to the Secretary of State it says:
	<br><q><p>"His troubles do not end there. Through his letter box recently came a polite little note from Vic Feather expressing concern about the Bill. Readers may be assured that despite the cares of office Mr. Feather has not donned a kaftan and set off clutching his worry beads to the nearest freakout. What concerns Mr. Feather is the possible effect of the proposed legislation on trade union activities. He cited examples of night shift workers holding mass meetings or a Jarrow-style unemployment march which by its nature has to spend nights in the open air."</p></q>
He wants an assurance that the Bill would not be used against trade unions. I hope he gets that assurance. The only way he could get that assurance would be by having in the Bill a Clause which exempts trade unions, a Clause along the lines of the Amendment suggested by my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crouch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On this question of trade unions and any possible restriction on

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
their assembly, surely he would agree that Clause 1 does take account of this, particularly in regard to existing trade union celebrations. I was talking to one of his colleagues on his side of the House last night, who was saying how well the Durham miners' gala is organised, with due regard to the comfort and convenience of everyone taking part. This could well be covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if a march by the U.C.S. shop stewards, for instance, would come under Subsection (	<i>l)(b</i>) of the new Clause,
	<br><q><p>"that night assemblies in pursuance of arrangements made by it have been held over a substantial period".</p></q>
Before this Government, workers had never had occasion to march in this way. Doubtless they and other similar organisations will have occasion to march in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the hon. Gentleman is in honour and duty bound to accept an Amendment along these lines and if he does not do so he has no appreciation of the basic civil liberties and right of freedom of assembly and to get together of the people of this country, liberties and rights which we have all taken for granted. If we had not taken them for granted, why does he bring forward this Bill at all?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have by no means exhausted the examples of the sorts of people who would be caught by the provisions of this Bill, and I intend to refer to one or two more. For instance, there was a peaceable all-night vigil conducted on behalf of the Angela Davis Committee. Before the hon. Gentleman opposite bristles, the purpose of that all-night vigil was to apply some pressure on the authorities to allow bail for Angela Davis. Angela Davis got bail, and one of the reasons was the peaceable way in which many people assembled all night for this very laudable objective. That would be caught by the hon. Gentleman's Bill. So the hon. Gentleman must realise that a number of events peaceably held and attended by decent law-abiddng people, events whch offend nobody and constitute no offence, would be caught by his Bill which, in his own words, has a very narrow object indeed.

12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the hon. Gentleman will say that he is prepared to accept one or another
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
of these Amendments. Whatever the hon. Gentleman and his supporters may say, there is no doubt that young people in this country attend pop gatherings because they enjoy them, and for no other reason and many, incidentally, prefer going because they are idealistic youngsters and go to festivals which have no commercial profit. The best-conducted festival, and the one most young people talk about in very idealistic terms, and which has become something of an unique event, was the Glastonbury Festival—a "beautiful" festival is the word they use. It is a word which we do not often use in the House, a word which has become almost the exclusive property of young people. So much that we have to discuss is not very beautiful at all, unfortunately. That festival was free, and the people who attended it went because it was free. Festivals of that sort—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned the recent festival in my constituency. I ask him—it was free to whom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Free to the people who went, as I understand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was it free to the people who live in the area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may not have been free to people who live in the area, but I know it was a very well-conducted festival which youngsters enjoyed and about which the police have received no complaints. The enjoyment was added to by the fact that it was free to a great number of people. I do no see the purpose of the hon. Gentleman's intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All sorts of other gatherings could be affected by the Bill—for instance, Guy Fawkes parties and May Balls, which both the hon. Gentleman and I, because we went to the same college, must have attended, though probably with a different type of partner. Those May Balls, presumably, would be caught by the provisions of the Bill. Boy Scouts' jamborees have been mentioned, and there is a letter which appears in 	<i>Motorcycle News</i> expressing fears that motorcycle rallies would be affected by the Bill. The hon. Gentleman I am sure has seen the letter. All in all, because there is no definition of pop festivals, or of the sort of assembly they have in mind, the provisions of Clause 1 are intolerable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that the 	<i>New Law Journal</i>, the issue of 2nd March, 1972, deals with the Bill and is critical of it? It says:

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is slightly more important than Lady Caroline's party, but Lady Caroline should have her party if she wishes, and it would be difficult under the provisions of this Bill.

The Government are always talking about the need for having properly drawn up legislation. Sloppy legislation is bad legislation, as we all agree, yet here the Government are happily supporting a Bill in which though it is aimed at dealing with pop festivals, the words "pop festival" do not appear from start to finish. That must be unique for any legislation. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will show me a Bill which has a certain objective and yet does not define the objective. If people in this country realised that the Bill did not contain the words "pop festivals," and yet was intended to deal with pop festivals, the credibility of Parliament would be further diminished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

He sponsored this Bill and said, "Here is this Bill; get along with it and try and deal with the civil liberties side." Those responsible for the Bill have a responsibility to bring for-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodnutt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If this Bill is aimed at the people who are specifically mentioned—pop festivals are the problem at the moment—who knows what the successors to pop festivals will be?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is what we are getting at. It is nothing to do with pop festivals apparently.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course not. No one who wants to stop anything ever says anything about stopping it, but brings in regulations which make it impossible for the thing to go on. That is what happened with this Bill. It is a typical piece of underhand legislation. Perhaps the hon.

Considering that this Bill has Government approval, its drafting is an absolute disgrace. It is appallingly drafted. There has been no attempt to meet any of the objections and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will say that he will at least accept these Amendments.

With the exception of the 	<i>Daily Telegraph</i> leader, every newspaper comment has been critical of it. If the hon. Gentleman is happy to bask in the approval of the 	<i>Daily Telegraph</i> leader, considering the terms in which it was written, then he is welcome to do so, but if he is going to escape the criticism that he is totally unconcerned about civil liberties and about the peaceful assemblies which take place, he really must be prepared to accept these very moderate Amendments. If he does not accept them, then I am afraid that I and my hon. Friends will feel more suspicious about his motives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Maddan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee very long, but this debate has revealed some fundamental points. I want to address myself, first of all, to the major part of the argument of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Bill appears to me to seek to control night assemblies for the good of both those attending them and the neighbourhoods in which they take place. It does not matter very much whether it is a Guy Fawkes' party, Lady Caroline's ball, or a pop festival. The noise can be excruciating and can keep neighbours awake all night. I remember a case in Bayswater not very long ago, when there were very substantial complaints from neighbours about a coming-out ball. In an age when we are against pollution, and when noise is perhaps one of the most insidious forms of pollution, I do not think it is at all wrong for Parliament to have a Bill in these terms. I think there is a great deal of cant in listing organisations, and in supposing that something is going to be done which will suppress their freedom. To my mind, it is not the essence of freedom to be able to make a noise and to demonstrate for three hours between midnight and six o'clock in the morning. I do not regard that as an essential freedom at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to return to the European Declaration of Human Rights, which makes the situation very clear. All this Bill does is to give some chance of underpinning the exceptions in paragraph 2 of Article 11, to which we have previously referred; for example, those which are in the interests of a democratic society, in the

interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, and for the protection of the rights and freedom of others. That is exactly what this Bill aims to do.

The hon. Gentleman the Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks) asked whether our neighbours in Europe across the Channel would think we were striking a terrible blow at our traditional freedoms. I can tell him about France. If he would look at the 	<i>Code of Administration Communale</i>, 1884—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member go back to the Amendment? We are getting on to a wide-ranging Second Reading debate again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maddan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I accept what you say, Mr. Wallace. I was answering the point which the hon. Gentleman made about whether we were undermining civil liberties if we did not restrict the application of this Bill. I just wanted to say that in that law of 1884, Articles 97 and subsequent Articles, give both the mayor and the prefect very full powers to deal with exactly the sort of case we are talking about, and those powers have been exercised in recent times. So we are not doing anything novel in the European context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we should do this morning is to accept the new Clause 1, because that at least makes general progress in the direction which many hon. Members have indicated, but we should ask my hon. Friend for an undertaking that he will consult with hon. Members who have expressed opinions in this debate, and consult with other advisers, in order to improve that Clause between now and Report. It would be a pity if we left this debate without having taken any step forward to limit the application of the Bill, as many hon. Members have suggested. That is the best way of going ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it was the hon. Gentleman the Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Well-beloved) who said that promoters of such assemblies can be left to come to arrangements on a voluntary basis. The fact is that on many occasions they have not accepted reasonable conditions on a vol-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0134">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
untary basis. So that something along the lines—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman not aware that, while it may be true that some promoters have been unreasonable, it is equally true that many local residents have been totally unreasonable in their objections to a festival? Will the hon. Gentleman deal with that point also?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maddan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with it if you will allow me to do so, Mr. Wallace. Local residents may have had exaggerated feelings, but I doubt whether those feelings would be translated into action by local authorities under the terms of this Bill. We are not going to have a referendum in the area where a festival or some other assembly is to take place. The proposal is that the local authorities should lay down conditions. So I do not think the hon. Gentleman's point is at all relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some substantial points have been raised about civil liberties, about traditional activities, and so on, and, clearly, some exceptions should be made. I believe that the new Clause points the way. I do not believe it is a perfect way. That is why I suggest that the best course this morning is for my hon. Friend to undertake to consider it further between now and Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First of all I should like to apologise to the Committee for my comings and goings but, like many other hon. Members this morning, I am sitting on two Committees at the same time. The state of organisation of our procedure in the House of Commons at the moment is something which would make any pop festival look like a paragon or order and regimentation. Indeed, when my hon. Friend quoted from the 	<i>Daily Telegraph</i>, and mentioned people of alien, uncouth and terrifying appearance who assemble by night, I did not know whether it was yesterday's editorial or the Lobby Correspondent who was describing hon. Members of the House last Wednesday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With a Bill of this kind, every hon. Member must always be vigilant about the liberties of the subject, because it is always under the guise, sometimes deliberately, often accidentally, of dealing with a particular group who should be protected against themselves, or from whom the community should be protected on grounds
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
of public order or public health—particularly if that group is not especially popular with the majority of people in the country—that the liberty of the subject is eroded. There is a strong possibility that, unless the Amendments are substantially accepted by the hon. Member who is promoting it, this Bill will be a serious incursion into that liberty to assemble which people have held for many centuries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendments seek, in one way or another, to narrow down the Bill to its intended application. If the hon. Member is seriously concerned with the effect of pop festivals and a lot of hon. Members in this Committee have some support for him, particularly with regard to preventing the exploitation of those who attend pop festivals—he must narrow down the Bill to the specific wrong which he wishes to remedy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member and other hon. Gentlemen who continually refer to pop festivals and to their definition will look at my starred Amendment, and which can be discussed, they will see that at a stroke—and I have to use a very hackneyed phrase—that gives them their answer so far as limitations on the liberty of the subject are concerned, by the inclusion of the word "musical". It may well be that it would prohibit the playing of Beethoven's Fifth as well as modern pop, but it would cut out all the difficulties about religious organisations, trade union organisations, political organisations and other people, such as caravanners and cyclists, who might assemble by night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another Amendment deals with the very important point of commercial gain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many hon. Members say that they do not want to imperil meetings of people at other than pop festivals. They do not want to stop an open air meeting of trade unionists coming off the night shift. They do not want to stop a Jarrow-type march. They say that that is not the intention of the Bill. If that is so, then the hon. Member who is promoting the Bill must give a little, and must look at these Amendments. Whether he accepts them in their present form or in some other form, he will be in very great difficulty, both in this Committee and in the House, unless he changes from his inflexible approach which embraces all assemblies, whether pop festivals, musical assemblies or any other kind of assemblies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his Amendment No. 46, my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Cray-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0135">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
ford (Mr. Wellbeloved) deals with caravans. I do not think that Amendment or the 1960 act deals with tents. They deal only with caravans and not with tents. I wonder whether my hon. Friend has realised the significance of his words "in the open air," in the case of an organised event such as a caravan rally. I am a caravanner. I enjoy going off in a caravan in the Summer Recess—if we get any Recess this year. When I sleep at night, I sleep in my caravan, not in the open air. One is not in the open air if one is in a caravan. One is not in the open air if one is in a tent. One is not in the open air if one is in a marquee. One is in the open air if one goes out of the tent, the marquee or the caravan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether the hon. Member who is promoting this loosely drafted Bill has seen the possibilities in this. The Bill would not apply to people who are housed in tents, marquees or caravans, and a coach and horses could be driven through it. We have a duty to the House which has sent us this Bill, either to make a proper Bill of it or to throw it out, and it is the duty of the promoter to look at points like that. So far as I know, the words "in the open air" have never been judicially defined. Perhaps the promoter will look the matter up. But I would contend in any court, that if I was in my caravan I was not in the open air, and the same would apply to a tent. I should be in the open air when I left it and went out through the flap of the tent or through the door of the caravan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very interested in my hon. Friends argument, because with his legal experience he has great knowledge of judicial interpretation. If people at an assembly were in the toilet, would they be in the open air or not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would say that it would depend upon the construction of the toilet. If it were a toilet with a roof on and with proper walls, then they would not be in the open air. If, on the other hand, it were a ramshackle affair, such as one often finds, then they would be in the open air. It would depend upon the comfort of the toilet whether one was in the open air, and a person would certainly know whether he was in the open air.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to new Clause 1, which is worse drafted than the Bill itself, and this at a time when the promoter has had the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
opportunity of hearing the objections of hon. Members. If he had sought to remedy the problems which we have seen in the Bill he could have put them right in this new Clause, but this he has manifestly and significantly failed to do. The hon. Gentleman the Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Woodnutt) put his finger on one of the greatest difficulties of the Clause when he addressed the Committee earlier; that is, that it fossilises existing organisations. It really means that no new organisation can ever get into being, no matter what its purpose may be, whether musical or otherwise. An existing organisation can prove that it holds assemblies, but a new organisation cannot hold assemblies under the Bill, and therefore can never prove that it should get an exemption certificate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crouch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is in danger of misleading the Committee, because the new Clause does not state that no new promoter can ever hold an assembly. All that it seeks to do is to state that a promoter should observe certain conditions for the public safety and convenience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With due respect, what it states is that no new promoter can obtain a certificate of exemption till he can prove that he has over a period of time, without endangering public health in the course of his arrangements, held assemblies by night "over a substantial period," which is the peculiar phrase used. How long is a substantial period, when a new promoter has to keep applying for licenses before he can get a certificate of exemption? Indeed, will he ever apply for a certificate of exemption in these circumstances? As the hon. Gentleman said, this new Clause tends to fossilise existing organisations, and at least gives them considerable preference and precedence over new organisations which may come into being.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point about the new Clause, which my hon. Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson) made very clearly, is in regard to subsection (1) (	<i>a</i>). That states that the objects of the organisation must
	<br><q><p>"include the encouragement or promotion of recreational activities".</p></q>
The promoter of the Bill knew full well that some of us were worried not only about recreational activities but about political, religious, and devotional activi-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0136">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
ties and possibly even educational activities. One can envisage the Bill having effect if one were observing a comet or an eclipse. These are not recreational activities. Why did he not widen the new Clause to take care of the many factors to which hon Members have been addressing their minds?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection 1(	<i>b</i>) of the new Clause says:
	<br><q><p>"that night assemblies in pursuance of arrange" ments made by it have been held over a substantial period".</p></q>
By the very nature of it, a demonstration, protest or Christian witness against an atrocity in this country or the world at large, is not held, one hopes, over a substantial period of time. Otherwise they would become hackneyed and unsignificant. One wants to have a political protest or Christian witness when events suddenly happen and when feelings are high. One might want to demonstrate all night, perhaps to show sympathy with people in South Africa, South America, the United States of America, or this country. One could never anticipate this four months in advance. This is the sort of point hon. Members on this side are concerned with. The new Clause takes us further back. It does nothing to alleviate the doubts and fears. The people of this country of all political parties have traditionally been entitled to demonstrate, and I hope they always will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right that any protest may take place and frequently does take place suddenly. An example with which I am sure hon. Members opposite will agree would be a protest at the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia. That could not take place under this Bill because one could not give four months' notice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very good example, and one can envisage in future events at home and abroad causing not only political and trade union protest but religious and Christian protests which could take the form of an all-night vigil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not like the Bill at all, even the attack it makes on pop festivals. In so far as it assists those who attend pop festivals and prevents them from being exploited financially, or from a public health point of view, the promoter has my blessing and support, but in so far as it takes away the right to assemble, even at a pop festival, I am opposed to it. Whether we as M.P.s
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
like pop festivals or not, young people are entitled to hold them if they want to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless the hon. Members who are sponsoring the Bill give way, far more than they have done in the new Clause, to the sort of objections hon. Members have raised, they will not get very far with their Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dissent from some of the things the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) has just said. Particularly I support the right of young people to hold pop festivals if they so wish, but it comes to the point that other people have rights in this matter. One of the things about the discussion this morning has been the omission of mention of the civil rights of those people who live in the neighbourhood where, through no cause of their own, there are large gatherings such as the kind we have seen in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am as much on the side of defending civil liberties as anyone in the Committee, but Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 do not go to the root of the problem. They suggest that the only harmful gatherings are those conducted for commercial profit. I do not believe this to be the case. Anybody who promotes any type of assembly must have some responsibility to the people who live in the area where such an assembly is promoted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson) mentioned Glastonbury. It was actually the Pilton Fair which was in my constituency. He showed his ignorance by saying that it was free. It was free to those who attended, but not free to those who lived in the area. It was not free to the residents of the County of Somerset who had to foot a very large bill. The promoter of that festival came to see me many months before it took place. It was privately sponsored, and the promoter came to see me in good faith. He told me the sort of numbers he expected, the amount of money he intended to spend on the event, and he gave me a lot of facts and figures. Events of this sort cost a very great deal of money and this event must have cost the promoter and his backers a considerable amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a minimum amount which has to be spent by the promoters of this sort of night assembly, whether they are called pop festivals or musical festivals. The Bill sets out to ensure that a reasonable amount is spent on the facilities. Two
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0137">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
festivals have taken place in my constituency, one enormous, and one reasonably small. At one there were between 150,000 and 200,000 people present. The district council has taken a very balanced view about them. I would agree with practically everything the hon. Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved) said about protecting the civil liberties of those who want to assemble, but in the course of these festivals the inhabitants of the area, a quite small village, suffered major inconvenience, noise, and some damage, from which they should be protected. The county faced considerable cost for the police protection. The police had to mount a large operation because they had no idea how many people were going to attend. It was costly, and the cost fell on the ratepayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not possible to say that these festivals can be promoted for nothing. They take a lot of preparation if they are to be done properly, and a substantial amount of finance. Even if they are properly sponsored they must be properly managed and financed and the preparations must be properly made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept that Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are the right way to go about this. We have to take into account all types of gatherings of this size at night, be they musical or be they other sorts of gatherings. Even religious gatherings must have reasonable facilities for those who attend them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I talked to large numbers of people who came to Glastonbury. It was called a religious fair, and I am not going to dispute whether it was or not. Almost without exception the people to whom I talked said they would like to have seen better facilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why is such emphasis placed on what happens between midnight and 6 a.m. when the same kind of thing could go on between 6 p.m. and midnight? I accept the importance of the point the hon. Member is making, but why does it suddenly start after midnight when the same kind of thing could happen in the previous six hours?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difficulty that the drafters of the Bill had was in trying to limit it to those events at which a large number of people stay overnight in a small area. One could have a political meeting before midnight, but one would be un-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
likely to have a large political gathering or meeting for three hours after midnight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maddan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Huddersfield, West (Mr. Lomax) made an important point. Perhaps my hon. Friend would comment on this. Is it not a fact that—unless an assembly goes on between midnight and 6 a.m.—not only is the risk of people's sleep being interrupted far less, but the sanitation problem is far less? We all know that first thing in the morning there are certain functions which we perform which are not normally performed at other times of the day. I have very close experience of three pop festivals and I have every sympathy with those who attend them. Those who stay overnight are faced with a quite different problem from those who go merely for a day time event.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that if large numbers of people go to an area overnight they require a substantial number of latrines. Otherwise they will only go to places outside the area. This causes all the troubles and complaints and increases the feelings locally against the younger generation and exacerbates the generation gap. Much of what has been said this morning has been said with a desire that we should try to maintain the enjoyment of young people as far as possible, but let us remember that other people are involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was one of the sponsors of new Clause 1. There is room for including in that new Clause the Amendment the hon. Member for Erith and Crayford introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see why that should not be included almost as it is in new Clause 1 without including specific clubs and other 	<i>bona fide</i> bodies which the hon. Gentleman has mentioned. It would save those bodies having to go through the procedure in new Clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon.

Gentlemen in the next few days to see whether we can get an agreement on this for Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome that, and I hope my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) will accept it, because we do not want to have to put barriers against 	<i>bona fide</i> clubs in

any way. We want to make it simple for them to be able to proceed with their activities in as fair a way as possible. We are anxious that some balanced measure of control should be introduced in the case of the fly-by-night and long-prepared festivals of the kind we have seen recently, particularly in my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Member give us a little more information about the festival at Pilton which he described? How much did it cost to organise? He displays a certain knowledge about its organisation. I am interested that someone should spend so much money to organise a festival on that scale without wishing to obtain a return or a profit, and would like to know whether the organisers recovered their expenses or made a profit by the sale of exclusive rights for refreshments and other franchises. Since the hon. Member tells us that the organisers displayed some responsibility and approached him seven months before the festival was held and organised in good faith I should like to know why they were not so responsible if they presumably took his advice that the site was not suitable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say the site was not suitable. It was on a private farm. The results of the preparations did not match up to the promises, and I think the promoters found it was more expensive than they expected. When they came to see me the figure talked about was £20,000 to be spent on the promotion, and I do not think it turned out that anything like that became available; £800 was to have been spent on dustbins, but I did not see any, just piles of waste in a small barbed wire enclosure. There were to be 1,000 seats of latrine accommodation, but they were not there at all, and there were merely pits which had been dug. I could willingly pass the hon. Member the balanced report by the Somerset Medical Officer of Health which shows the facilities provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the promoters acted in good faith initially, but did not realise what they were taking on. The owner of the farm lost a considerable amount of money. He is considering another festival this year, perhaps slightly different, and this time has invited criticism, and has invited a vote from people in the village as to whether they want to see another festival. Far from them all being against another festival, out of the people who
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
voted—201 as a result of 500 letters—101 welcomed the idea, 89 were against and 11 said that they did not care either way, which shows that there is not the feeling against, provided the facilities are there and that it is well organised. What they are against is a total lack of organisation at these events, including the one the year before attended by over 150,000 people, who had a complete lack of facilities for that sort of event.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little confused, because I thought the Pilton festival was the one he described as the large one but it seems that the other was the big festival.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member means the larger one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The one in 1970 was at the Bath and West's show ground, and there again the facilities were totally inadequate for the number who turned up. The promoters were certainly out for commercial profit. We will never know exactly what they made. The promoters seemed to disappear quickly afterwards. On that site there was only one telephone for those large numbers of people, which gives just one indication of how people who came there were exploited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ray Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest to the debate, particularly to the arguments deployed by my hon. Friends about the new Clause and the two Amendments which seek to limit the scope of the Bill and reduce it primarily to those organisations which might organise night assemblies in pursuit of profit. While I sympathise with the motives behind their arguments I nevertheless feel that we should not be exclusive on a matter as fundamental as the right freely to associate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pop festivals lie at the heart of our deliberations, and we have to remember that music and entertainment is a business. I would wish that it were organised in some other way, and that it were a nonprofit-making source of entertainment and recreation, not just for young people to enjoy, but for the whole community. The fact remains that it is a part of the commercial activity, and, therefore, if we tend to make pop festivals exclusive in this way and deal with them as profit-making bodies we are deliberately isolating the pop festivals. I cannot see why that should be done. Perhaps some other
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0139">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
argument will be brought forward which will sway me, but at present I am in grave doubt about supporting either the new Clause or the two Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a thoroughly bad Bill. The motives behind it are vindictive, for reasons which I will explain later, but I accept that it is obviously necessary to see that crowds of people of 25,000, 50,000 and 100,000 are properly organised. As this is a new phenomenon and an important one, I cannot see, as has already been pointed out, why the Government could not have had the courage of their convictions and dealt specifically with health organisation and other problems associated with these current large gatherings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope my hon. Friend will understand that it is not certain that this Bill can be defeated. We are trying to amend it so that we may protect the basic civil liberties of the people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate what my hon. Friend has said, but he can appreciate that at the heart of this Bill lies an attack on pop festivals, and the Bill is seeking to isolate the group against which it is directed. I feel that civil liberties are as precious to someone who wishes to attend a mass musical event as they are to someone who wishes to attend an all-night vigil, a trade union meeting, a Remembrance event or Lady Caroline's ball on Daddy's lawn or at the back of the Marlborough Downs or somewhere else in Berkshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The Bill is a very bad Bill as such. The purposes of the Amendment are purely, if the Bill cannot be defeated, to protect as many people as possible from its provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept entirely what my hon. Friend has said, but there remains at the back of my mind the one doubt—civil liberties for whom? For every one, or for the majority? Perhaps my hon. and learned Friend can elaborate later on that point in this debate, which will obviously be carried over to a later occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have much sympathy for young people today living in a mass society where habits are changing and life among the young is changing at a rapid pace. I imagine that in the future the pop festival which has emerged over the past five or six years will become much more a part of the life of young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not be stretching my arguments too far if, arising from the points I have developed, I raise something else which is fundamental to the rights and liberties of the individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are predominantly an urban community and will become more and more urban in future. One factor which has been ignored so far, because all the other points are extremely important, is the constant tussle and struggle between those who live in an urban community and those who live in the countryside.
