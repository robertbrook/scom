	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 91, in page 3, line 16, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or receiving any payment for any right to make records, films or sound or television broadcasts of the assembly or any part of it, or for the right to supply goods or services to persons attending the assembly".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this Amendment we can take Amendment No. 85, in page 3, leave out lines 23 to 31 and insert:
	<ol>
	<li>"If at a night assembly section (Control of night assemblies by local authorities) (6) of this Act is not complied with, any person promoting the assembly or being concerned in its management shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £400.</li>
	<li>Where a person is charged with an offence under subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>)above as being such a person as is mentioned in subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>), (	<i>c</i>) or (	<i>d</i>), or is charged with an offence under subsection (3), it shall be a defence for him to prove either—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>that he had no responsibility to the managers or promoters of the night assembly for seeing to the matters to which the charge relates; or</li>
	<li>that, having such responsibility, he used all reasonable diligence in discharging it.</li>
</ol>
	<li>Proceedings for an offence under this section shall not be brought except by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions, or by the local authority."</li>
</ol></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 4 deals with the offences that might be committed, in terms of fines and also the persons who might be liable for prosecution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right to point out that if the local authority or whoever presses the prosecution under the Bill takes the matter to a magistrates' court and a person is found guilty on summary conviction, the limit to the fine would be £400. One imagines that it would be for the minor offence—the smaller crime, if one could use that word—but it would deal with a smaller
	<span class='label label-info column'>262</span>
movement away from the purpose of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, however, promoters are determined to try every possible means to get round the Bill's provisions and avoid great expense as a result of their activities, they can be fined on indictment, in which case there is no limit on the amount of the fine. I believe that that is the right way of dealing with penalties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the Amendments, and the way in which we have re-grouped them. We are concerned that semi-innocent parties who—although perhaps being liable in the first instance under the original Bill—have taken reasonable precautions to defend themselves by finding out what is going on shall not find themselves liable to conviction under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those people covered in subsection 2(	<i>e</i>) and (	<i>f</i>) in the original Clause 4 have been moved up to come in with persons under subsection 2(	<i>a</i>). The persons whom we are after are not the members of the camera crew, or persons selling hot dogs—a casual reader might come to that view—but the promoters or the persons employed by or contracted with the promoters to sell the festival rights to film or catering companies, or whatever it might be. It is clear that such persons are likely to have a deep financial interest in the organisation of the assembly, and it is right and proper that they should be coupled with the persons promoting the assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the request of the Opposition, we have added the necessary defences, and I think that the new subsection (4)(	<i>a</i>)—
	<br><blockquote><p>"that he had no responsibility to the managers or promoters of the night assembly for seeing to the matters to which the charge relates: or (	<i>b</i>) that, having such responsibility, he used all reasonable diligence in discharging it."</p></blockquote>
covers extremely well those people in subsection 2(	<i>b</i>), (	<i>c</i>) and (	<i>d</i>) who might, quite innocently, be prosecuted for something for which they should not have been prosecuted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the debate at our last Sitting the question of the occupier of the land was referred to. I am cognisant of the criticism made by the Opposition, in particular the hon. Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved). However, it seems to me that, irrespective of anything in the Bill, an occupier has some responsibility for ensuring that his land is not used for unlawful purposes. I speak as a tenant farmer who has a substantial
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0262">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>263</span>
responsibility for what goes on on my land, and a responsibility to my landlord. Therefore, there is nothing new about placing on the occupier the responsibility in terms of occupation of land. That is a well-established point in law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause makes the occupier liable in respect of any failure to make sure that his land is not used for unlawful purposes. It could be argued that an occupier may be in legitimate doubt about the lengths to which he is required to go. For that reason he might be reluctant to agree with the promoter in the first instance. That argument carries things a very long way. Having accepted that there is responsibility on the occupier of land, it does not seem to me that the responsibility laid on the land occupier in the Bill is any worse than that laid on an occupier of land in many other instances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am open to listen to the arguments on the point, but for the moment I should like to leave my Amendments Nos. 91 and 85, as shown, on the Order Paper. I have not, however, closed my mind to the possibility of making some concessions, if the arguments for doing so are good ones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with great interest to what the hon. Gentleman said. His Amendments go some way towards meeting the strenuous objections that we raised to the Clause as originally drafted, which, in our view, might well involve many innocent people who play no part in the staging or promotion of an assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two specific offences are involved. The first is the putting on of an assembly in contravention of the Bill, as when a promoter completely ignores the necessary procedure and deliberately puts on an assembly for which permission has not been obtained. We all agree that that would constitute a serious offence, and should be treated as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second offence is a totally different one. It arises not from putting on an illegal assembly but from non-compliance with a requirement that a local authority may have imposed. In this connection, I am not satisfied that anyone other than the promoter or a close associate should be caught by the provisions of the Clause. I therefore give notice of my intention—I am sure that I will have the support of my hon. Friends in this matter—to table an appropriate Amendment on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>264</span>
I am aware of the seriousness of the contravention specified in subsection (1) (	<i>a</i>), but I am not sure whether there should not be at least some form of statutory defence for such a promoter, based on the degree of his awareness whether he was acting in contravention of the Bill. At present there is no such provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that there may well be a common law defence and that if a promoter were brought before the court the fact that he had no knowledge that he had acted in contravention of the Bill would weigh with any reasonable court in reaching a decision. Nevertheless, as at present drafted—and even as amended—the Clause mentions several categories of person other than the promoter, such as a person giving notice of the assembly, the occupier of the land, or a person receiving payment for the right to attend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The drafting is extremely confusing. Several lawyers to whom I have shown the Bill have assumed, as was my first impression, that the word "receiving" was a mistake for "making". I am assured that that is not the case, however, and that people such as musicians, comperes, and ice cream or hot dog vendors will not be caught by the Bill. I should be happy to receive the hon. Gentleman's assurance that no person who innocently attends an assembly—certainly no one who has paid admission money in order to attend—could be caught by the terms of the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would explain more fully what is meant by:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any person receiving any payment for the right to attend the assembly;"</p></blockquote>
which I still find confusing, despite the hon. Gentleman's explanation. However, I now understand the phrase.
	<br><blockquote><p>"any person receiving any payment for any right to make records, films"</p></blockquote>
I understand that the desire is to involve the person who, for example, lets out the right to make television films, and who is part and parcel of the promoters. I understand that provision, since a promoter might well be a company with television interests. I presume that the reference to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any person receiving any payment for the right to supply goods"</p></blockquote>
comes under the same category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends and I would like the situation to be carefully examined, in order to ensure that those who play or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0263">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>265</span>
sing at a pop festival, or sell necessary services—and certainly those who attend the festival, who cannot be expected to know whether necessary provisions have been contravened—should not be caught by the Bill. After all, heavy penalties are involved. It would be outrageous if innocent people were involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that I need say any more at this stage. As I have said, I give notice to the hon. Gentleman of my intention to pursue this matter on Report, with a view to tabling an appropriate Amendment to Clause 4. I am satisfied with the defence provided in subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>), but I consider that the provisions of subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>) are too arbitrary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has discussed this matter and, as I pointed out in my earlier remarks, we have done everything in our power to meet him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am certainly at one with the hon. Gentleman on the underlying intention of the Amendments. I think there is no disagreement on either side that under the terms of the original Clause certain innocent people might have been penalised. I shall look forward with interest to the hon. Gentleman's Amendments on Report, simply because my hon. Friends and I have done our best to meet him on this question. We shall be interested to see his proposed improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of giving an assurance regarding those who attend an assembly, I can only reaffirm my earlier remarks. It must be stressed that persons who purchase either the right to supply goods or services or the right to make records, films, and so on, are nowhere covered in subsection (2) and are not subject to any penalty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same is true of persons who attend the assembly as listeners or performers. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take that as spelling it out abundantly clearly. He has said—and he is completely right—that those who sell the rights to attend are, to all intents and purposes, promoters or partly promoters. If one individual promoted these things—an individual person or an individual company—the whole problem would be much easier. The hon. Gentleman knows full well that the groups involved are often somewhat diverse. The purpose of spreading the Clause widely is to make sure that the people who receive
	<span class='label label-info column'>266</span>
the money are the people who are liable to see that the terms of the Bill are carried out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>APPEALS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 86, in page 3, line 33, leave out from "may" to end of line 41 and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"appeal to the Secretary of State.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(2) An appeal under this section shall be by notice to the local authority and to the Secretary of State which must be given within fourteen days of the date on which the notice under section 2 was given.
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>(2A) Before determining an appeal under this section the Secretary of State shall, if either the applicant or the local authority so desires, afford to each of them an opportunity of appearing before, and being heard by, a person appointed by the Secretary of State for the purpose.</li>
	<li>(2B) On an appeal under this section the Secretary of State, having considered the report of any person appointed under subsection (2A) above, and any expression of opinion by that person as to the suitability of the site proposed for the night assembly or, as the case may be, as to the requirements which ought to be imposed in connection with the assembly, shall either—
	<ol>
	<li>dismiss the appeal, or</li>
	<li>quash the notice appealed against and substitute for it any other notice which he thinks the authority ought to have given;</li>
</ol>
and where he acts under paragraph (	<i>b</i>) above the substituted notice shall be deemed to have been given by the authority under section
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0264">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>267</span>
(Control of night assemblies by local authorities) of this Act".</li></div> <!-- ul --></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In many respects I look upon this as one of the most important Clauses, if not the most important Clause, since it provides the appeals procedure that has disturbed many people outside the House. They have been afraid that the provisions of the Bill could be unjustly used against an innocent promoter to prevent the holding of a pop festival. The reasons could be blind prejudice, dislike of noise or of large numbers of people, or any other reason, none of which would stand up in a court of law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen know that under the original appeals procedure proposed in the Bill, an appeal would be heard by a nominee of the Secretary of State. The Amendment alters this, so that the appeals procedure will resemble that of a planning appeal. An inspector will be dispatched within 14 days of the date of the requirement for the appeal to listen to evidence from both sides. He will then report to the Secretary of State, who will issue his ruling. He will be enabled to dismiss the appeal altogether or to quash the notice and rewrite it. This removes the possibility that an eccentric inspector might be appointed. The sieve that will now be applied to an appeal under the Bill will ensure that no major injustice can arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many who feel that a court of law, for example, the Crown Court, might be a more suitable place for this type of appeal. The Crown Court will be both slow and, more important, expensive, for hearing appeals against unreasonable requirements, or against requirements made by local authorities under the Bill. The procedure proposed is quick and cheap. It has been proven in other areas, and I believe that it is ideally suited for this purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of magistrates' courts has been raised. I mentioned it in the Second Reading debate. In the light of present thinking about pop festivals I doubt whether the local magistrates' court would be the right place to hear an appeal. I am in no way casting aspersions on magistrates, who would do their best to adjudicate fairly, but there would inevitably be enormous pressures upon them. Therefore, I reject the idea of the magistrates' court as the place for an appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>268</span>
Hon. Gentlemen opposite have asked for an assurance about the grounds for appeal against the adjudication of the local authority. As I read the Bill, whether there be a refusal to hold the festival in the first instance on the ground that the site is unsuitable; whether the conditions that the local authority lays down are too onerous, or whether the security to be deposited is too high, the inspector and, subsequently, the Secretary of State, may rule. All the criticisms that an unreasonable condition can be imposed are, therefore, completely removed. After a few appeals have been heard it is to be hoped that these matters will be resolved without having to go to appeal. The Clause is a protecion for both parties—certainly for the promoters—and I believe that we have reached a satisfactory conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to hon. Gentlemen opposite for their help, because they may have felt that this arrangement was more onerous than that which was first introduced in the Bill. It is better, fairer and more likely to lead to correct decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I need not speak at any great length on the Amendment because the Committee is basically in agreement. As originally drafted we regarded the Bill as a menacing attack upon civil liberties. I was of the view, as were all my hon. Friends, that because the Bill was dealing basically with civil liberties—with the right of assembly—the proper authority to deal with an appeal was the Crown Court, which has always been the arbiter of matters concerning right of assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as the hon. Gentleman has given way on so many points, I think that my hon. Friends now concede—I certainly do—that in the circumstances an appeal to the Secretary of State would probably be the cheapest and most effective way of dealing with the matter. I should like to hear from the Minister—either now or on Report—exactly how his inspectors will be instructed to deal with appeals because the way in which the inspector reports and the Secretary of State uses his discretion is most important. Indeed, the success or failure of the Bill depends upon the way in which the appeal procedure is carried out. One cannot underestimate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like an assurance from the Minister that his inspectors—and certainly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0265">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>269</span>
the Secretary of State—will reject any capricious use of power by a local authority; will turn down measures which have been imposed by local authorities which are in contravention of the code, which are unnecessary, and are the product of a bigoted or intolerant council, or a council under pressure from bigoted and intolerant biased local people—and there are such people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The success or failure of the Bill depends not only upon the way the Secretary of State uses his discretion; it also depends how binding the code of conduct is on local authorities, the inspector and the Minister. The code of conduct should not be something to be casually referred to by a local authority, which may say: "Yes, we will have a look at it," with no intention of abiding by it. We should apply much more stringent measures in the code of conduct. It should be binding on a local authority to consult. It should be equally binding upon the inspectors and the Secretary of State. If the Secretary of State does not use his discretion to reject onerous conditions, if they became precedents, local councils will be encouraged to turn down applications and effectively stop pop festivals or other assemblies being put on. The object of the Bill will have been defeated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am satisfied with the procedure laid down, but I should like an assurance from the Minister as to the way in which the inspectors and the Secretary of State are to carry out their duties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two points about the procedure on appeal. First, there is the machinery. Obviously, one must set up a form of appeal that will be expeditious. The whole process of appeal would be defeated if the parties wishing a hearing were delayed for any length of time. The Secretary of State will allot this duty to inspectors, who will be ready to undertake inquiries at short notice. Normally our inspectors are booked up many months ahead for planning inquiries and so on, but there will be a deliberate arrangement that the inspectors to whom this duty is allotted will be available for hearings to be fixed quickly, so that decisions may be made as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is the consideration of
	<span class='label label-info column'>270</span>
the cases that come before the inspectors. The inspector and, eventually, the Secretary of State, will decide each case on its merits. At this stage I do not intend to lay down rules about it. We shall be drawing up a code of practice and, as the hon. Member for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson) said, it is the code to which the local authority, the inspector, and the Secretary of State will refer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consideration will be along these lines: first, the inspector will look at the Bill, which in new Clause No. 8—which will become Clause 2—lays down certain statutory requirements, such as that the site is suitable. A local authority should look at an application from that point of view, and not from some capricious point of view, such as the colour of the eyes of the applicant. Its consideration must relate to the things that are set out in new Clause No. 8. Obviously, as in any other case of this kind, the inspector and the Secretary of State would reject any capricious use of the powers, because that would not be in accordance with the statutory duties placed upon local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to reference to the code, the hon. Gentleman used the word "binding" several times. I am reluctant to use that word when we are not making conformity with the code a statutory obligation. We wish the code to be flexible and suited to the occasion. To begin with, it will to some extent be experimental, and we shall learn to modify it by experience.

But there is no point in having a code unless it is a code. It is a document that goes further than guidance. We could have chosen to ask the Committee to accept the idea of a departmental circular setting out the way in which the Secretary of State would wish assemblies to be organised. I look on a code as something one step further than merely guiding a person to reach a decision. It is something to which that person must give serious attention. Only if there were some exceptional reason, which would be disclosed in announcing the decision, would there be any suggestion that the decision ran contrary to any item in the code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that that is as far as I can go without prejudicing the procedure under which both sides make their representations to the inspector, and the Secretary of State eventually decides on the recom-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0266">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>271</span>
mendations that he receives from the inspector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main need is for the appeals to be dealt with expeditiously, not only by the inspector in fixing a hearing but by the Secretary of State in considering the inspector's report. I hope that in practice we shall be able to reduce many of the burdens that we place on inspectors in their extremely thorough recording of evidence, and of how they reach their findings and conclusions in planning decisions. We must balance the need for speed with the need for full examination of the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the procedure as now laid down meets the needs for an appeal procedure. We originally thought that we could deal with appeals without the need for a political decision by the Secretary of State, by appointing an inspector whose own opinion, without any reference to a Minister, would be decisive. However, after consideration with the Opposition we have come to the conclusion that it is right to give the Secretary of State the responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be two stages of the appeal. The inspector will decide the facts, setting out what he finds in his conclusions and recommendations, and the Secretary of State will then apply his mind to those recommendations, using the code as a background. We will learn by experience how that works out. We have set out the framework on which to build up a reasonable set of precedents. After about 12 months both sides will know the way in which an inspector will apply his mind to these inquiries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman say which type of people will be appointed inspectors?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no special qualification for an inspector of this kind. We recruit inspectors to the panel from all professions. Obviously, one looks more to the personality of the man than to his profession. The Department has ideas about creating a career structure for inspectors. But inspectors generally come from various professions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who will be allotted this duty will not differ in experience or qualities from those who are at present conducting
	<span class='label label-info column'>272</span>
planning inquiries. Anybody who has appeared before inspectors on planning inquiries will agree that they achieve a high standard in the conduct of those inquiries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are indebted to the Minister for the clear explanation that he has given the Committee. The fact that appeals may be held quickly at short notice affords great advantage and overcomes many of the fears and apprehensions held by hon. Members on this side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the Minister's statement that the inspectors will not be different from those who are already conducting planning appeals on behalf of the Secretary of State, I am not entirely satisfied that that is the right type of person to be appointed as an inspector. I realise the difficulties that must inevitably be associated with a new venture of this nature. I therefore put this point to the Minister. I am not pressing him for an undertaking at this stage, but perhaps he could tell us that he will consider taking the advice of the advisory committee which he has told us will be set up by the Secretary of State in sorting out the job specifications, the qualities required in an inspector to conduct the kind of inquiries which will be held under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not just a matter of suitability of the land or of public health and safety, important though those matters are—and we have given importance to them by agreeing that they should be specified in an earlier new Clause. There are also the factors of civil liberty. An inspector must be alive to the responsibilities that we hope he will have to ensure that he is upholding not just the letter of the Bill but the spirit in which it is now being passed so rapidly through the Committee and perhaps through the House at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the rules themselves, under Clause 5(4) the Secretary of State has the responsibility of making and presenting to the House a Statutory Instrument which may be annulled in pursuance of our normal procedures on the Floor of the House. I should like to ask whether in framing the rules he will again have the benefit of the advice of the advisory committee, and secondly, whether he will include in those rules a requirement to have due regard to the code of conduct
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0267">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>273</span>
which he will at some stage be promulgating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also said that alter 12 months we shall have some body of experience on appeals with which the matter can be reviewed. I would therefore press him to give an undertaking that after a specific period, perhaps 12 or 24 months, he will give the House an opportunity through its Statutory Instruments procedures to review the operation of the Bill, perhaps by presenting some variation to his rules which would provide an opportunity for a debate. That would ensure the possibility of the House examining with the Minister the operation of the Bill and would go a long way to reassure all of us in the Committee and those outside who are concerned that the Bill should work properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may respond to the hon. Gentleman's queries. First and foremost, the rules envisaged in Clause 5(4) would be drawn up in consultation with the Council on Tribunals, and the Tribunals and Inquiries Act, 1971, will apply to these appeals. They are undoubtedly the type of appeal to which Section 15 of that Act should be applied. It would therefore follow that any regulations would be drawn up in co-operation with the Council on Tribunals. I hesitate to give any firm undertakings at this stage as to what might be included in those rules beyond saying that there are obviously precedents for this type of appeal, and into those precedents we would endeavour to weave the advice which we would receive—certainly I can give an undertaking to take advice from the advisory committee which has been proposed—and the code of conduct recommended by the advisory committee. Without giving any undertaking as to the drafting of the rules or exactly what will be included, since that will be done in conjunction with the Council on Tribunals, I would certainly say that we should take advice in the Department from the advisory committee when drawing the rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of a job specification for the inspector, I am very satisfied with the service which our present inspectors give on planning appeals. I cannot for the moment see that there is any real distinction between what they have to do and what an inspector would have to do on appeals under the Bill. The hon. Gentle-
	<span class='label label-info column'>274</span>
man said that the inspector should pay attention to civil liberties. Of course. Indeed, I am sure that the present inspectors in dealing with planning appeals deal with that sort of thing. It is a question of balancing the civil liberties of those who hold or take part in the festivities and those of the residents in the area. Any inspector must balance them one against the other and try to reach a fair judgment—I do not say the judgment of Solomon, because when I said that before I was told that the judgment of Solomon was never carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of bringing this before the House, I would be optimistic enough to think that we shall be able to produce such satisfactory regulations that the whole matter will go so smoothly that the House will not want to be bothered with debating it. But apart from that optimism, I certainly think that there will be some amendments to come to the regulations. We shall learn by experience and I should not be at all surprised if within 12 months we had amendments to propose to the regulations. The House would then be given an opportunity, if anybody should choose to bring it forward on a negative Resolution, to debate the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister intend to have a specialist panel of inspectors to look into the appeals? There are some factors involved which do not arise in normal planning decisions. In addition to civil liberties, there are factors such as noise and other nuisances which affect people living in the area. Do I take it that there will be a specialist panel out of my hon. Friend's normal panel of inspectors who will be earmarked or allotted for this duty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, it is intended to allot this duty to certain inspectors and to ensure that they are free to take these inquiries at short notice. Whether it should be an individual or a panel is a matter that I must leave to advice from my officials, but I should have thought from the way the number of applications is running at the moment that it would be wise to have two inspectors always ready to take hearings of this kind. Those inspectors will obviously instruct themselves on the sort of things which have to be decided. If an inspector knows that he

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maddan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 34 has been grouped with other Amendments, which I hope does not mean that we are going to have shades of Standing Committee D on local government reform. It is an attempt to determine in the context of the Bill, and not in a doctrinal way, which is the better authority—county or district—to be primarily involved in fulfilling duties laid upon the local authority by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendments deal with the first three subsections of this Clause in the Bill as it was originally printed. The primary authority should be the county, but it should have power to delegate its function, with or without restriction, to a district if it thinks it appropriate. For instance, if there is a suitable open space in the City of Bristol and a pop festival
	<span class='label label-info column'>276</span>
is being promoted there, the district council might be thought to be a suitable authority to exercise these functions, but, on the whole, primary responsibility should be pinned on county authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another reason for that choice is that it lessens the chances of there being a festival on a site overlapping local authority areas. All of us are aware of this; we live on the corner of a map, and pop festival sites by the same mathematical considerations may often be on or near a district boundary. They are less likely to be on or near a county boundary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could well be that a district council subject to the pressures of electors in that district will tend to say "No" to night assemblies, giving too much weight to the civil liberties of those living in the area, rather than to those wanting to enjoy or promote an assembly. A county council, because its members are drawn from a wider area, is more likely to take a detached view of the rights and wrongs of that topic. The chance of local public pressure being exerted to such an extent that there will never be a night assembly in that area will be less if we place responsibility primarily upon the counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Woodnutt) has reminded me that hon. Gentlemen opposite will take that point and will therefore support the Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other, more technical, reasons why county authorities should take responsibility. The duty laid upon the local authority has to be exercised in the context of strategic planning in the county. It is not a planning control decision. It is a departure from the planning purpose established for the land on which a night assembly is to be held. It is also a matter of highways, access, traffic and so on which is also primarily a county responsibility. Safety matters such as fire must not be overlooked, and this is also a county responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Considering what duties have to be fulfilled under the Bill, it is clear that most of them are county responsibilities, hence the Amendments. It will be seen that Amendment No. 94 provides for delegation to the district council on such occasions as the county authority thinks suitable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Maddan) but I cannot recommend my
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0269">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>277</span>
hon. Friends to support his Amendments. However, we take his point that if a district council is the responsible authority for the purposes of the Bill, a district may then fail to the blandishments of people like Mr. Wentworth Day. On the other hand, there is no evidence that county councils are likely to adopt a more moderate or enlightened view. Quite the contrary. Of course, my mind may be overburdened with what took place in the Isle of Wight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulties to which the hon. Gentleman referred, such as pop festivals being held on the edge of land controlled by two district councils, are already covered by subsection (3) of the Clause. Is that not a complete answer to the hon. Gentleman's case? Where a district council feels that the operation of the Bill could be more properly performed by the county council, power is there in subsection (3) for arrangements to be made accordingly. With regard to unreasonable restrictions that a district council, under the influence of someone like Mr. Wentworth Day, may wish to impose, reasonable provision has been made in the preceding Clause to safeguard the public interest against such unreasonable interference by that type of district council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe the Amendments to be unnecessary and, therefore, ask my hon. Friends not to support them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodnutt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved) always seems to be overburdened with problems like the Isle of Wight. I am touched by the interest he shows in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He said there was no evidence to show that county councils would be more favourably disposed than district councils. He quoted the Isle of Wight where the sites chosen for the 1970 Pop Festival were opposed by the district council and county council. To add to what my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Maddan) has said, I hope the Committee will give further consideration to placing responsibility on the county council. There is more chance of the chosen site for a proposed assembly overlapping two districts, than there is of it overlapping two counties. If responsibility is with district councils, there is a greater chance of their having to set up a joint committee to deal with the matter than if it rested solely with the county council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>278</span>
My experience of local authority joint committees—and I have plenty—shows that it slows up proceedings. One usually finds that people representing one district council will have delegated powers to make decisions, while others have to refer back to a main committee, or even the full council. That is what happened in the Isle of Wight in 1970. We set up a joint committee of the county council and the district council concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was another problem. The promoters suggested three or four sites in three different districts. A situation like that will have the opposite effect to the Gentleman's promised speed-up in the whole procedure. The more we remove the possibility of setting up joint committees, the more likely a speedy decision, and I should like to impress that thought on the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that point about delay, the hon. Gentleman is aware that if the local authority—whether a joint committee, a county council or a district committee—has not served notice under the Bill within one month of receiving notice from the promoter, its powers will lapse, and it will have no powers to interfere with the holding of the festival?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodnutt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow that absolutely, but if there is a lot of referring back to different councils, they will have to speed up the decision, and if they find they do not have enough time they will make a wrong decision, or impose the wrong conditions. Anyone having to make a decision should be making the best of the available time, and should not be pressed into a corner so that a decision has to be made hastily—which may then be wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another aspect. Promoters will more likely than not put in a choice of several different sites, asking the local authority which it would prefer, or which would be subject to the least onerous conditions. That is what happened on the Island on each occasion. That being the case, they can submit sites in two or three districts, and it is then far better for the county council, the larger authority, to look at the whole area—something which it would do more dispassionately than the council of any district—and decide on the best site for the county as a whole, and for the residents of each
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0270">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>279</span>
locality, and not just for the promoters and the fans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A site could be on the edge of a district, on a border with another district, and the district in which the event is not to take place could be much more affected perhaps because of the general terrain. If it is lower down on the slope it will have a drainage problem which the other district will not have. The absurd situation of one district authority laying down the rules which are to affect the district authority next door could arise, and in those cases it would be far better to have the larger authority, the county council, look at it objectively and make the decisions. After a decision is made it could become a district council matter and the county council could then delegate its powers to the district authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Committee lightly toss the Amendments aside, they should look closely at what we have said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not wish the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Woodnutt) to think that some hon. Gentlemen are lightly opposing his Amendments. I was glad to hear him pay tribute to our concern for his county, the Isle of Wight. He is correct to pay tribute to my hon. Friends who have supported him in his campaign to preserve the Isle of Wight as a separate county, and I am delighted that he recognises our interests in and concern for his Island.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having always been fated to live on the edge of a district council, I recognise the strength of his argument about the effect of a pop festival or night assembly held near the edge of a district council's area. However, that argument could also apply between counties—a problem not applicable to the Isle of Wight where a pop festival could not overlap into another county. The pop festival in my constituency would have affected the county of Warwickshire as well as the county of Worcestershire. However, the hon. Gentleman's argument is valid, and there will be fewer cases of two counties being affected than of two districts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for the Isle of Wight and for Hove (Mr. Maddan) are not giving enough weight to the forthcoming announcement from the designate Boundary Commission. We shall be told about proposals for new district council boun-
	<span class='label label-info column'>280</span>
daries, and districts will be larger than in the past. The problem will recede, and even in the Isle of Wight it will not be of such importance as in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point is whether one believes in local democracy. It is difficult for those who support the Bill—as I do—to claim that local people living in the area have rights which must be considered, as well as those wishing to attend the pop festival, and yet to argue that the decision must be taken at some distance from those living in the area, as otherwise their representatives will be subjected to the blandishments of local residents and will be persuaded to oppose any pop festival. Decision-making powers should be left as near to the grass roots as is possible. They cannot be given to the parish councils, but district councils are to become larger and more powerful, and I should prefer to retain the decisionmaking power at district council level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) does not accept the Amendments, I shall vote with him in opposing them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A great deal of thought was given to which local authorities should ultimately have the powers under the Bill. I shall not offend anyone by saying that Clause 6 is long and complicated, but it has been drafted to cover many of the points raised by my hon. Friends in their speeches. Problems are caused by the pop festival or the assembly on a border, but if we accept that the Bill is about public health and similar activities, the district authority has the day-to-day responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodnutt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentioned public health. Fire is another point—the stationing of fire engines. Access from major highways is the responsibility of the county. How is the district council to lay down rules about access from main roads, which is the responsibility of the county, when it has no power to do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no question that in the event of a large night assembly being held, the county authority will have to be consulted. The question is whether to give the county authority the prime responsibility, asking it to sub-contract to the second-tier authority, or whether we give the prime responsibility to the second-tier authority and ask it to consult
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0271">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>281</span>
and bring in the top-tier authority. I have no particularly strong views about the matter, but in asking the Committee to resist the Amendments I ask hon. Members to take into account the point that the Rural District Councils Association, the County Councils Association and the Municipal Boroughs Association have given their blessing to the Clause. I understand from people who deal with such matters that to obtain agreement on this type of question is helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me appropriate that we should keep the Clause as it is, for the simple reasons that I have stated. I ask the Committee to resist the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly. First, for my own political future I must add my tribute to that of the hon. Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved), who was the subject of some fulsome praise at the last Sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not happy about the Amendments, because they appear to suggest a further delegation of power from district councils. As hon. Members will be aware, places like Bristol and Norwich are suffering a good deal of indignity from local government reorganisation and I should not, therefore, like to see a further slipping away of control from the cities which have a proud and historic past. I join with the Bill's promoter on this occasion in resisting the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I ought to give the official view, even if it is only sitting on the fence, between the two types of authority. It is true that in the Bill already it is recognised that the county council will have a part to play. It is the proper authority for co-ordinating two or more districts when a site stretches over two or more areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Woodnutt) on joint committees is a powerful one. When there are two authorities combining to make a joint committee to deal with a matter of this sort, it is not as expeditious as one authority dealing with the matter on its own. There is the problem of three or four sites, and I think that we shall see this in more applications in future, because promoters will wish to come within the code and put forward for consideration sites over a wide area so that a choice can be made of the one that fits in best with the code. I believe
	<span class='label label-info column'>282</span>
that we shall receive applications from one promoter covering a number of districts in order that the right site may be chosen. To that extent, it would be right for the county council to deal with the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Maddan), that the counties might deal with such questions more dispassionately than district councils which are so closely concerned, works both ways. Those at a distance would not be so passionately affected by the application for a site within a district area. But it can be argued that the primary responsibility should rightly fall on the local authority whose electors will be most directly affected by the inadequacy of the public health arrangements and so on. The argument, therefore, works both ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a difficulty, because many applications under this Bill will affect services which, in the Local Government Bill now under discussion in Parliament, we have divided between county and district. The county will have highway powers, and, as my hon. Friend said, fire services and other services relevant to such applications. The district councill will have the public health responsibilities which are at the basis of an application for a site. In that respect the district council would appear to be the right authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So long as the two authorities consult with each other over the applications, however, and come to an arrangement about how to deal with them in practice, I do not think that it matters to whom we give the primary responsibility. I echo the old refrain which colleagues serving on the Local Government Bill Committee will know; there is always "Clause 101 which used to be Clause 100."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was shocked by the word "delegate" in Amendment No. 94. We have discarded that word altogether in local government reform. We use the word "agency" in Clause 101 of the Local Government Bill. There will also be provision after April, 1974 for authorities to form joint boards, not just 	<i>ad hoc</i> when an application arises, but a joint board to deal with applications in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Committee would be wise to leave the Bill as it stands. But I give an assurance that my Department will urge county and district authorities to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0272">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>283</span>
be prepared to deal together with such applications, so that the services that must be provided for festivals may be readily decided by the two authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) in resisting the Amendments, because I believe that the Bill is primarily a matter of public health. That is what we must get right in the Bill, and it is the district councils' responsibility. Some councils are likely to have more experience than others, in areas where festivals tend to be held. One district council in my constituency has experienced all the festivals in the area, and has built up an expertise in dealing with them. For those reasons I support my hon. Friend in resisting the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maddan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate. What has come out of it is that it is a finely balanced matter.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is easier for the matter to be arranged from the one to the many rather than the many to the one.

	<p>all the points have been sensible.</p>
	<p>Nevertheless, I think that with the Bill as drafted we have marginally got it wrong. Would my hon.

If we were to do something on the lines suggested in the Amendment, in view of the progress made in the Local Government Bill, the phraseology in this Bill should be changed. I hope that my hon.

However, this is a clear-cut issue whether, on the one hand, the second-tier authority should consult the top-tier authority, or, as my hon. Friend wishes, the top-tier should consult with the second-tier. I feel it right and proper that the Committee should resolve the issue this morning. That is not a dogmatic or doctrinaire view.

I foresee substantial difficulties in holding a pop festival of more than 5,000 people for more than a day in the City of London, but I can also foresee that that

New Clause No. 10 deals with the code of practice. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister will have something to say on the subject, since it will ultimately be the responsibility of the Secretary of State to gather together the appropriate com-</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Brought up, read the First and Second time and added to the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>mittee and subsequently to publish the code.
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>
	<p>There is nothing particularly complex about this concept. I think it is a widely held view that some advice was desirable from those who specialise in such areas as, for example, popular music, the organisation of pop festivals, and other sectors which may not have produced experts in Whitehall. Thus it was felt right and proper that outsiders should be invited to offer advice in drawing up the code of practice.
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>
	<p>The committee will recommend the code to the Secretary of State, who will be enabled to approve and publish it. The Secretary of State, once he has approved the code, will then be required to circulate it to local authorities. I understand that the code, once printed, will be available in the ordinary way through the Stationary Office.
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>
	<p>The only question whch remains in the minds of my critics is whether or not the code should be completely binding. I have maintained from the outset of the Bill that we shall fall into a serious trap if we allow the code to become such a bible that any deviation from any phrase or part of it will constitute an offence. I believe that we have hit upon a very happy medium in this respect. New Clause No. 10 covers the difficulties that people outside have felt might be con-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0275">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>289</span>
tained by the Bill and answers those who would reject a rigid code, as I would.
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>
	<p>My hon. Friend has said that this is to some extent an experimental matter. I agree. There can be no question that experience of these large gatherings is building up all the time. I was delighted to see in an advertisement for one to be held quite shortly an emphasis on the very things with which the Bill is concerned—lavatories, sanitation, car parking, tented accommodation, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>
	<p>I am certain that the pop fans want these facilities. I am equally certain that it is right and proper that they should have a say about standards that should be imposed. Many of them have told me that when they go out into the countryside they wish to have no restrictions, but some also say that they think it reasonable that there should be proper lavatories and safety regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>
	<p>I return to the fundamental approach to the Bill. The code of practice will reflect the detailed requirements—the number of lavatories, the acres of car parks, and so on—and will provide guidelines as to the suitability of the site and the kind of safety arrangements to be imposed. I can well see this producing a satisfactory arrangement, whereby the promoter will have a reference to which he can go, as will the local authority. Let us be frank; only a handful of local authorities, to date, have had any practical experience of these things. A committee constantly reviewing the situation should provide a very happy compromise.
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>
	<p>I know that hon. Gentlemen will have comments to make. I shall therefore sit down now, but I am fully prepared to deal later with any points made.</p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ray Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee for long. I apologise for coming in late—just another example of what the dreaded European Communities Bill does to important matters like the Night Assemblies Bill, by stopping us getting in on time. I am concerned about one or two matters which are covered by the Amendments in the names of my hon. Friends the Members for Erith and Cray-ford (Mr. Wellbeloved) and Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson). There is no intervention from you this morning, Mr. Wallace—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column'>290</span>
must not suffer from an excess of guilty conscience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is something that is forced upon me, Mr. Wallace. Whenever I step through the door into the Committee room I feel your beady eye upon me, although this is probably our last morning. I hope that we shall get through uninterrupted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred last week to the question that concerned me. Subsection (2) of new Clause No. 10 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"but neither the local authority nor the Secretary of State shall in relation to a particular case be held to conformity with any particular provision of the code."</p></blockquote>
I accept, as the sponsor of the Bill has said, that we cannot have a hard and fast, rigid code. Clearly, it must be flexible in order to deal with different conditions, crowd sizes, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, I should like to be reassured by the sponsor—and I warn him that I shall return to this point on Report—that the code will not be so flexible as as to allow local authorities which are bitterly opposed to night assemblies of any kind so to construct a case that it could even get past an appeals machinery. This is an important point. As I said last week, it could undermine all the work that we have done in the Committee in trying to reach what the sponsor has rightly called a suitable compromise. He has not said enough this morning to reassure me. I hope that he can provide some reassurance, but I must warn him that I intend to return to this matter on Report, and I have no doubt that other hon. Members not on the Committee will also wish to say something about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other thing that disturbs me is the word "may". I seem to remember, in relation to another Bill on the Floor of the House, not long after I entered this place, having a considerable discussion early one morning with my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Crayford and others as to precisely what "may" meant. Apparently one cannot say "shall" or "will". For some legal reason, "may" is not merely the appropriate word but the only word that can be used. I should like the position re-stated this morning. I want to be reassured that "may" does not imply the possibility of the Secretary of State's deciding that he may or may not send out the code of practice. From my rather simple lay position, I should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0276">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>291</span>
prefer to substitute "shall" or "will" for "may". Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Accrington can address himself to that point and let me know whether, in legal terms, the definition that I have just given is correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sponsor of the Bill should also reassure the Committee that no attempt is being made to allow the Secretary of State to decide whether or not he should send out the code of practice. If there is any possibility of that situation arising, I for one would not support the new Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek reassurance on those two points, with the concluding note that I intend to return to them on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This discussion on new Clause No. 10 is probably the most important that we have had since the Bill was amended. If the amended Bill is to achieve its object, it stands or falls, first, on the composition of the committee, secondly, on the nature and contents of the code and, thirdly, on the way in which local authorities, the inspector and the Secretary of State apply the code. I should like to deal with those three points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall move an Amendment in due course, asking the Minister to spell out the membership of the committee. I do not mean name by name, but I want a firm assurance from him as to the sort of people that he intends to appoint to the advisory committee. It is no good having an advisory committee composed of stuffy people. I cannot think of any member of the Committee whom I should put into that category for one moment. A reasonable and sensible code of conduct should be drawn up—one that will ensure that pop festivals or other assemblies are put on in decent conditions, but not with provisions so onerous as to guarantee that an assembly cannot take place. If we do not formulate sensible regulations—if they are too onerous—the whole purpose of the Bill will be defeated and a bigoted, biased, stuffy local authority will be able to ensure that its preconceived notions are carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us be honest; the Bill cannot change the nature of local authorities. It cannot change the hearts and minds of those who serve on authorities. Some local authorities will be determined, at whatever cost, to ensure that in no circumstances shall any pop festival or other assembly take
	<span class='label label-info column'>292</span>
place. Authorities will always find a reason for doing that. That is why the Opposition have always felt that the Bill as originally drafted was menacing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with the general argument of the hon. Member for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson). As he pointed out, if one brings large numbers of people with a noisy engagement into an area, some people will oppose it. Does not the hon. Member also accept that if and when the Bill becomes law it will be much harder for unreasonable authorities to find unreasonable reasons for opposing festivals? It could be argued that the Bill will have substantial merits for the honest and good promoters of pop festivals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. Otherwise, we should still be discussing Clause 1, line 1. It is only because the Minister, in his wisdom, and the promoter have conceded that they will operate the provision by a code of practice that we have made the progress we have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the code of practice is to have any meaning—if we are not to get back to the original arguments and are not to play into the hands of intolerant, bigoted councils, it is important that the conditions in the code of practice should be reasonable and sensible, and not too onerous. If an advisory committee is to draw up the code it is important that we know exactly who is on the committee. That is why I have suggested that the committee should be of a reasonable size, say, seven people, of whom at least two should have some experience of staging night assemblies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that those two people would be drawn either from musicians or responsible disc jockeys—people who have had experience of putting on musical, jazz or pop festivals. The Bill is most concerned with the night assembly. If there are no people of that sort on the committee, those who are trying to stage night assemblies will feel aggrieved and say that the committee does not represent their views. I ask the Minister for an assurance on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to see on the committee somebody who belongs to an organisation representing civil liberties. The Bill still concerns civil liberties, in that we are dealing with the free right of people to assemble. Even if it is to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0277">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>293</span>
safeguard public health and safety, their inherent freedom has been threatened in a small way by the Bill. Therefore, there should be on the committee a representative whose main concern is with civil liberties and their protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not happy, because the code is so important, with the phrase "have regard to". That seems to be too vague and I believe it might result in some local authorities which do not in any circumstances want to have an assembly in their districts to disregard the code, to treat it lightly, to have a cursory look at it and then to dismiss it and apply their own conditions. I have therefore inserted in my Amendment the words "act in accordance with". The code must be of some binding nature. A local authority must feel that they have to look at the code and justify their decision to the Minister, on the basis of that code. It is no good their saying, "We did have a look at it. We did not think it very sensible. We did not want to be tied to those conditions." I feel that the words "act in accordance with", because they are more peremptory, will ensure that local authorities will have a greater regard for the code than the mere use of the words "have regard to".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the hon. Member's point that the code must not be too strict. It cannot spell out everything. Equally, I think that there would be circumstances where a local authority feel that they can put on a night assembly and that because of local conditions and circumstances all the conditions set out in the code need not apply. They might be able to dispense with certain conditions. They could put on the assembly and insist upon less rigid regulations than appear in the code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I have put in a let-out provision to enable an authority to
	<br><blockquote><p>"waive any requirements which otherwise they would be required to make in accordance with the code of practice, if, in their opinion, compliance with such requirements is not necessary, in the circumstances of the case, for ensuring public health or public safety."</p></blockquote>
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know what the hon. Gentleman's answer will be to my suggestion, that we should substitute the words "in accordance with" instead of "have regard to". He will say, "There may be some unusual circumstances which are not spelt out in the code which would entitle a local
	<span class='label label-info column'>294</span>
authority to say, 'No you cannot have the assembly'"—because it is to be held in an ancient monument or something of that sort. I accept that there may be odd circumstances where the code of conduct would not be entirely appropriate. But I believe that it is worth taking a risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 99 cases out of 100, if that particular circumstance were pointed out, it is likely that the promoter would not necessarily proceed with putting on the assembly. It is not a case, as is often suggested, of all promoters being totally unreasonable people, ignoring local wishes and proceeding with an assembly willy-nilly. There are many cases of promoters withdrawing their intention to promote an assembly after certain objections have been pointed out. The circumstances in which the code of conduct would not be appropriate, where a more onerous condition would have to be imposed, would be so rare that it would be worth taking the risk. To ensure that the words "have regard to" are not ignored, the words "act in accordance with" should be inserted instead, so that local authorities are aware that it is the code which must cover their objections, and not their prejudices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first deal with the specific drafting of the new Clause, to see whether it covers what has been said in the course of the debate. The first line imposes on the Secretary of State a discretion to approve a code of practice put before him by the advisory committee. This is a deliberate discretion. If, for example, the code put before the Secretary of State is something quite unacceptable, he ought not to be obliged by statute to accept it. The Secretary of State must be left with a discretion in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once having approved the code, the intention is that the Clause should become mandatory, and the Secretary of State must circulate it. I have been advised that that is what the words do. It may be that we ought to enlarge the intention by saying that the Secretary of State may approve and shall, upon approval, circulate the code. I am told that the words do that as it stands. However, if it is necessary to look at it again, there will be an opportunity to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The code will have been submitted to the Secretary of State by the advisory committee. Before the Bill becomes law, the Secretary of State is busying himself
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0278">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>295</span>
in selecting the committee. Perhaps at a later stage of the Bill, we shall be able to make a firm announcement about the committee. We have in mind a committee of 10 or 12 people with experience in youth interests, as promoters, in local authority work and on voluntary organisations concerned with this type of function. There is a difficulty in making it mandatory that certain interests shall be represented on the committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the Amendment to line 4 of the proposed new Clause to insert a subsection setting out certain specific interests. There might be occasions where a deliberate refusal of one of those interests to take part would nullify the advisory committee and the Bill. It would be better for this to be dealt with—and I ask the Committee so to accept it—on an undertaking that the Secretary of State is at present seeking to have on the Committee representatives of at least those four interests which I have already described. That does not exclude others concerned with this from helping on that committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is to be hoped that none of those asked to serve on that committee could possibly be called "stuffy" people. We are seeking those who are live and vital in this type of function. So much for the advisory committee about which more can be said at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now to the effect of the code when it is circulated, so far as the decision of the local authorities is concerned. We have used some mandatory words in the new Clause:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the local authority shall have regard to any code of practice …"</p></blockquote>
It is quite mandatory—" shall", not "may".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Have regard to" is preferable to "act in accordance with". If we use "act in accordance with" we shall be nit-picking over the code to see whether a local authority has abided by every word of that code and is acting in accordance with it. "Have regard to" places on the local authority an obligation to regard the code. The very fact that we call it a code of practice gives it some considerable force—such force that at the end of the Clause we have to relieve both the local authority and the Secretary of State from what might otherwise flow from those words, that they would have to act in
	<span class='label label-info column'>296</span>
conformity with the provisions of the code.

We must leave the flexibility; otherwise the code may never be drafted. I can visualise the conscientious lawyers in my Department trying, week after week, to produce a code which is as water-tight as is required by the Amendments. We shall have great difficulty in amending it when necessary. The advisory committee would feel that it would have to employ professional advice to draft it, because it is the advisory committee—and this is deliberate in the drafting—which will submit this code. It is not a code which I would wish to be drawn up in the Department. It will not be drawn up by professional civil servants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want a practical code from the advisory committee. They will seek assistance in drafting, but not to the extent of drafting a firm legal document. If we were to use some of the firm words in the Amendment, there would be considerable difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give the Committee the firm undertaking that the Secretary of State will appoint an advisory committee, and is at present seeking those who should act upon it. They will represent at least those four interests which I have mentioned, and there will be about 10 or 12 members on that committee with a chairman whom no one could call a "stuffy person".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The stimulation of the code of practice is probably the most important thing that has come out of the pressure for legislation. I think it can go far wider than pop festivals. The onus may well be taken in future as a sort of standard code of practice for the way in which people treat the countryside. It will help take some of the steam out of the growing conflict between those who live in cities and those who live in the countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is to be hoped that the Committee will not make the composition of the advisory committee or the code too rigid. It must be allowed to be as wide as possible in laying down sensible and valuable rules for the way people behave in the countryside, which will make it far more acceptable and far more likely that the steam will be taken out of the opposition that now exists when anyone suggests a large gathering in rural areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson) presses "in accordance with", then however loosely the code is drawn, there will probably never be another pop festival. Anyone with any experience of the problems which promoters have to face when it comes to the practicalities would agree that to insist that the provisions of the code are complied with as if it is a law would put paid to the whole idea. I am surprised at the naive ignorance of hon. Members concerning the practicalities of these affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has mentioned representatives of four sections whom he intends to put on the committee. If he intends to approach it in that way—which is not what I would hope—I hope that he can assure us that he will also have on the committee representatives of the farmers and representatives of those localities where pop festivals have taken place, and residents who understand what actually happens when a pop festival takes place in their locality—because they inevitably overflow into the surrounding districts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I have given any impression that we would appoint people to represent those interests, it is wrong. People with experience in these matters are to serve on the committee. The last thing I should wish to do would be to appoint someone to represent the local authority interest, or a spokesman for the promoters. I want them to bring their full knowledge to the committee, and we want that sort of experience represented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson) wish to move his Amendments? May I add that we shall have separate Divisions if so desired.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's assurance about the composition of the committee, and his intention not to crowd it with what I termed "stuffy people"—perhaps replacing them with "switched-on" people—it would not be right for me to press that point since I am satisfied with his explanation and his good intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not so naive and ignorant as to
	<span class='label label-info column'>298</span>
suppose that the wording of my Amendment is perfect, but nor am I so naive and ignorant as to assume that there will be no local authorities eagerly searching for a way round the code, and that is why I am anxious that the code should have a binding effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, whilst I am not at all satisfied with the Minister's assurances on the effectiveness of "have regard to", he has done his best with it. I do not mean to insult him in that, or to imply that he has not been helpful. I feel that another form of words is necessary and I give notice of my intention to put down another Amendment with perhaps a different form of words, to delete the let-out clause for the councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>POWER OF SECRETARY OF STATE TO EXEMPT ORGANISATIONS FROM THIS ACT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>
	<ol>
	<li>"Where an organisation whose activities are carried on otherwise than for profit satisfies the Secretary of State—
	<ol>
	<li>that night assemblies in pursuance of arrangements made by it have been held in the past; and</li>
	<li>that those night assemblies have been conducted in a proper and considerate manner and have not resulted in any danger to public health or public safety</li>
</ol>
the Secretary of State may grant to the organisation a certificate of exemption.</li>
	<li>Where such a certificate of exemption has been granted to an organisation and is in force, this Act shall not apply in relation to a night assembly which is held in pursuance of arrangements made by that organisation for a meeting for its members and which does not last more than five days.</li>
	<li>The Secretary of State may at any time withdraw a certificate granted by him under this section."—[	<i>Mr. Wiggin.</i>]</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, read the First and Second time, and added to the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>, That the Bill, as amended, be reported to the House.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It must on occasion be a mere formality that at this point the promoter of the Bill should rise to thank you, Mr. Wallace, for your chairmanship of the Committee. On this occasion it is not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0280">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>299</span>
a formality. We have had some protracted sittings and you have shown remarkable patience, forbearance, judgment and kindness in your handling of our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were to say more, I should probably be out of order, but I hope that hon. Gentlemen opposite will agree that there are others who, because of the major changes we have made in the Bill—those in the Department of the Environment, the Parlamentary draftsmen and the Clerk to the Committee—have been exceptionally helpful in handling the extensive amendments, sometimes at short notice, and it would be right and proper to mention that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I sit down, since I have been given formal notice that there will be several substantial Amendments on Report, it will only be right to allow proper time for that debate, and I propose to bring the Bill forward at the earliest opportunity, which will be the coming Friday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Wallace, I cannot let the occasion pass without seconding the tribute which has rightly been paid to you. In the light of our discussions, I can pay you no higher tribute than to say you have been a most groovy Chairman. Perhaps we can all now freak out at the next night assembly—provided that I can have the choice of whichever partner I happen to alight on at the top table.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We thank you, Mr. Wallace, the Clerk and the officials of the Department of the Environment for being so helpful with a difficult Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot finish without adding that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>300</span>
coming Friday is too early. Many hon. Members on both sides regard this as a most important Measure and will want to take part in the debate. It will be impossible for them to have had sufficient time to grasp the nature of the Amendments. We are no longer dealing with the same Bill. It is a totally different Bill, and there are many who cannot yet realise that. The promoter would be pushing his luck and would not be acting entirely fairly if he were to put forward so important a Bill with the substantial Amendments, as early as the coming Friday. It is important that all hon. Members read the Bill and the Amendments. Many hon. Members want to take part. We have been helpful and co-operative, and there is no reason why that co-operation should cease. However, if the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) brings the next stage forward as early as Friday, many hon. Members would think differently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have finished up on rather an awkward note, since both hon. Gentlemen were completely out of order, and I have yet to put the Question.

I should like to thank the Committee. We have certainly had our moments, and I shall have some vivid memories, and probably nightmares.
