<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
MINIMUM ANNUAL HOLIDAY PERIOD</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed</i>, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denis Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 1 deals with annual holiday entitlement. This subject was discussed in only a cursory manner on Second Reading, when attention seemed to be focused mainly on early retirement. Nevertheless, it is a matter of considerable importance.<br><br>
On Second Reading the Minister was good enough to concede that in questions concerning industrial negotiation the movement towards extended holidays was attaining greater significance. That is true. As president of my own union, APEX, I have myself been negotiating this year and in every one of the claims an increase in the amount of holiday entitlement has been insisted upon. There is undoubtedly a desire throughout the country for people to have more leisure. It is also significant that many trade union leaders now pay more and more attention in their speeches to this aspect of the industrial situation. This is due in a large measure to the increasing levels of unemployment, or what on Second Reading I called the increasing technological unemployment.<br><br>
The Minister told us on Second Reading that there was no evidence at that time—February last—that unemployment was due to structural or technological factors: it could be that it was due to a stagnating
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
economy. He went on to outline the steps which the Chancellor had taken and which he told us must be seen through before an effective judgment could be made as to whether the increase in unemployment was due to economic or to technological factors and changes—automation, greater efficiency and all that goes with it. That was four months ago.<br><br>
We have now had the effects in the economy of a whole year of the Chancellor's last Budget but one when he put substantially increased amounts of money into the economy. In this year's Budget he has done the same thing; he has put an additional boost into the economy. Economists estimate that in a period of 12 months covering two Budgets, the economy has had a boost of over £2,000 million. Yet no one would claim that the graph of unemployment shows a downward trend; although the numbers of unemployed this month are reduced, it is a marginal reduction compared with what it ought to be in the middle of the summer, and there cannot be any doubt for much longer that the case for saying that we have a great deal of technological unemployment is well made out.<br><br>
That leads to the question what the Clause poses—whether as a nation, we are now earning the right to more leisure time because we can produce in a shorter working week and a shorter working year the goods that society needs to sustain itself. I have said before that there is no virtue in work for its own sake, although every man should have a worthwhile job, for not to have is a soul-destroying business. Nevertheless, the technological revolution of our society is not being accompanied by any social revolution which enables us to take advantage of the situation we have ourselves created.<br><br>
One of the first ways in which we can do that, and therefore help the unemployment situation, is by increasing the amount of the annual holiday. But I do not rest the case for the Clause on that alone. I emphasise again the modern drudgery of the treadmill society in which so many of our industrial workers have to compete. They are working day after day and week after week in the same factories, pulling the same levers, pushing the same knobs, doing the same menial jobs. That is one of the by-products of automation, and it is clear to me that in those circumstances there is a case for the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0388">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
industrial worker to enjoy the same kind of holidays that many white-collar workers enjoy, particularly in the Civil Service, local government, the teaching profession, and so on.<br><br>
I see no logic in a situation where a man has to go to work early in the morning, at 7.30 to 8 o'clock, and is expected to have only half the holiday taken by people who are employed in rather more pleasant pursuits for a smaller amount of time per day, per week, and per year. Moreover, there can be no doubt that in the provision of holidays this country lags far behind many others.<br><br>
This is not the place to debate the pros and cons of entry into the Common Market, but it is fair to say in passing that one of the tests of the Government's good intentions is comparability of benefits when we go into Europe. We have heard much about comparability of the burdens which the British nation will be called upon to bear. I suggest to the Minister that he should give evidence of his Government's good faith—I am sure I carry all my hon. Friends with me, whatever views we have on the Market—by coming forward at this stage and welcoming proposals which would put us in line with the practice in most Common Market countries.<br><br>
France and Luxembourg already have written into their law provision for four weeks' annual holiday. That was conceded by the Minister on Second Reading. As I said then, a fascinating proposal is already going through the German Parliament to give four weeks' annual holiday and to link that provision with a gradual retirement provision, much more beneficial than anything we have thought about so far in this country.<br><br>
The case for four weeks' annual holiday after one year's service has been more than adequately made out. The only objection I can see to this proposal ought logically to come from the Opposition side of the Committee. If I am right in saying that trades unions are negotiating annual holidays more and more as a normal part of their negotiations, the people who in the end will be left without four weeks' annual holiday would be non-trade unionists for whom no one negotiates.<br><br>
It has always been part of the philosophy and principle of the trade union movement that, much as we resent and regret the failure of people to join the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
union which is negotiating for them, nevertheless it is right to have minimum national rates of pay and minimum national holiday entitlement for all workers, whether they happen to be members of a trade union or not. We are now sufficiently advanced along the road towards the enjoyment of the greater leisure facilities which modern society holds out for us to be able to say that this provision is not a day too late in being put on the Statute Book, and I recommend the Committee to agree to the Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will accept the Clause without much further ado. To be frank, one should say that neither major political party yet has an answer to the unemployment problem. If there were a change of Government tomorrow, we should still be saddled with an unemployment rate which is high by post-war standards but low by the pre-war standards, which I am old enough to remember.<br><br>
We have now concocted euphemisms for unemployment; we call it redundancy; my hon. Friend called it enforced leisure. That is what it is. We have long reached the stage in advanced industrial countries where we can, and do, produce a lot more wealth with a lot fewer workers. We see examples of this in the docks, in containerisation for instance—that is essentially the problem that my hon. Friend was talking about—where one can produce a lot more, turn over a lot more cargo, with many fewer workers. Of course, the dockers are understandably concerned about the problem.<br><br>
We have it in oil refineries. I remember the Secretary of State for Scotland complacently saying in the House a few weeks ago that a lot of the North Sea oil now being produced off Scotland would be refined overseas. When we pointed out to him that this was not satisfactory, he said that an oil refinery did not employ many people. It is true that at Fawley, or some of the other modern oil refineries, there is hardly a man in sight. It is so automated that it is a capital intensive industry. However, although there is spin-off and there is the possibility of the creation of new petro-chemical industries, the trend is in that direction.<br><br>
As our standards of living increase, so there is a corresponding increase in the switch from actually producing the goods to enjoying them and the services that go
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0389">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
with them. The Minister will no doubt produce figures of the growth in the numbers employed in the service industries—hotels catering for holiday-makers, or whatever.<br><br>
Many of the holidays in the EEC countries are religious holidays and perhaps there is a case for having more religious denominations in this country if it means an annual holiday for each denomination.<br><br>
That is undoubtedly one of the explanations for the holidays in Europe. But that cannot be the case so far as Members of Parliament are concerned, for instance. One of the charges repeatedly laid against Members of Parliament is that we sit here for about 32 weeks of the year and for the other 20 we are on holiday.</span></p>
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. R. C. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not this year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There will be less holiday this year. We all know that it is not "holiday" in the sense normally understood by the industrial worker, but it is equally false to claim that we work just as hard during the 20 weeks when we are away from this place as during the weeks when we are here. Ministers, for instance, may well do so. On the other hand, they do not have the chore of coming and listening to twaddle in Committees such as this. They do not have the chore of preparing their "spontaneous" anwers to questions. They do not have a whole lot of chores involving coming to the House and answering for their misdeeds. In fact, the parliamentary holidays are designed primarily for the convenience of Ministers to brief themselves—they are clearly not adequately briefed when they come to the House, and that has been painfully obvious in the last two years particularly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a Minister for six years, I always thought that I was adequately briefed. I am sure that the present Ministers are adequately briefed. It is just that they are incapable of comprehending their briefs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not go into that now. It would be out of order, anyway. I merely emphasise that we should not be here unless we had a good deal of job
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
satisfaction. The hours that we put in here are willingly put in, by and large, although sometimes not. We put them in because we find the job fascinating. We get a good deal of job satisfaction out of it, a satisfaction completely absent from a large number of the treadmill jobs to which my hon. Friend referred.<br><br>
I have only been down coalmines. My father was a coalminer. He had four sons, and he said, "I'd rather bury you than send you down a pit". He kept us all out. Increasingly, the rewards for those jobs will have to be geared in terms of the inconvenience, the filth and the lack of satisfaction in the job, quite apart from the boredom.<br><br>
The boredom of the production line must be seen to be believed. The first time I saw a production line was when I went to the model village of Port Sunlight. I had a holiday in Blackpool when I was a good deal younger and we had a day trip to Port Sunlight. We were taken through the model village and the soap works. There was a girl putting on cartons that had little holes stamped in the ends. There was a revolving wheel, like a bicycle wheel with six spokes. She had an enormous pile of these cartons. As the wheel slowly revolved, she would take a carton and put it on the spoke, and as the next spoke came round she put on the next carton. That was her job for eight hours a day.<br><br>
I was told in elementary economics classes that some people prefer boring jobs—"The girls can do this almost with their eyes closed and meanwhile talk about their boyfriends, prospective and past, and they do not find it boring". But undoubtedly a lot of men and women do find their jobs boring. I believe that one reason for many of the strikes in the car industry is precisely that. If one were to research into the reasons for strikes, one would find this factor. At the slightest excuse, workers say, "For God's sake let's have two or three days off this damned production line". It is a major problem that we must face in modern society.<br><br>
I refer to another extremely unpleasant job that ought to be compensated not simply in money terms but in time off the job. I recall the strike of the local government employees. One would imagine that those fellows had fairly good jobs compared with the job of a dustman, or even worse, the job of the fellows who
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0390">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
go down the London sewers. I remember an interview when one of those fellows spoke about the danger of drowning and about removing blockages—I dare not tell the Committee what the men have to remove to prevent blockages in the London sewers.<br><br>
I see no reason why we should not attach as much importance to the jobs of such men as to the jobs of highly qualified professional people like doctors, dentists and others who find job satisfaction in their work. They are no more important for the smooth running of our society than dustmen or sewer workers or coalminers.<br><br>
Many years ago I visited West Africa, and I make the point to show that where the climate is congenial, a great premium is put on leisure for the workers. I went down a coal mine in Enugu in Eastern Nigeria, where one walked into a hole in the hillside. It was what we would call a drift mine. The humidity in that pit was 100 per cent.; one stood still and the sweat ran down. Those men went in bare-footed, wearing nothing.<br><br>
I asked what the wages were. The manager was a Scotsman and the deputy manager a Welshman, or the other way round—anyway, they were foreigners. He said that the wages were about £6 a month. I said, "That must be the cheapest labour in the world". He said, "On the contrary: it is the most expensive". I asked, "How come?" He said, "You have seen the conditions. In 100 per cent. humidity you stand still and the sweat pours off you. These fellows work two days a week. They come in from the glorious sunshine and they go into the bowels of this pit to dig coal in their bare feet, sweating like pigs, and they make enough in two days to keep them. The rest of the week they enjoy the sun, go into the forest and live off what grows there". So they put a high premium on five days' leisure and two days' work. In our great civilised society we want to produce more and more cars to pollute the atmosphere but we do not build roads. The number of cars that stand in garages for 20 hours a day must be fantastic. We go on producing consumer goods in shocking, boring conditions, and yet do not provide the facilities to enable people to enjoy them, either in terms of leisure time, or of the provision of the services—building the roads, building decent cafés and hotels to service the travelling motorist.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
Many such arguments may be advanced in support of the Clause. I am glad to say that the trade unions are coming round to the view that this is an important part of their negotiating position and that they ought not to attach too much importance to money. Of course money is important—it is no good having extra holidays if there is no money to enjoy them. In the example of the railway men, an argument sometimes put up by hon. Members in the Conservative Party is, "Ah, but the railway men get a lot of 'perks', including free railway travel". A railwayman wrote to me saying, "What the hell is the use of free railway travel if my wage does not enable me to enjoy a holiday when I have travelled down to Truro?"<br><br>
One wants the money to enjoy the leisure, but one wants the leisure, too. The unions are coming round to this view, partly because they know that leisure is important to working men, and partly because it would be a partial solution of the employment problem. I hope, therefore, that the Committee will support the Clause.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Terry Davis—I am sorry; Mr. Ifor Davies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ifor Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have an opportunity of supporting what my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) said so effectively about drudgery at work.<br><br>
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) on introducing the Bill, which produces a new concept for industrial relations. It is remarkable that, despite the advanced state of our industry, we rely on collective bargaining for holiday entitlement. The Bill introduces a statutory requirement, and it is vital to our industrial progress.<br><br>
On Second Reading the Minister said that longer holidays meant higher labour costs. That is one side of the coin. Longer holidays can save costs. My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, West, referred to the drudgery of work and to his visits underground. I have collieries in my constituency—and many other industrial concerns, and so I appreciate his point. It is a fact that emotional disturbances rather than logical grievances lie at the root of many industrial upsets.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0391">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
Working conditions can affect one's emotions.<br><br>
I draw attention to some recent remarkable figures which reveal the effect of the drudgery which can be reflected in costs. We hear much about the loss of time through strikes. In fact the latest figure is about 13 million days. Compared with the number of days lost through certified sickness, which is 342 million days. Included in that remarkable total are 23 million days as the result of industrial injury and 32 million days as the result of mental illness.<br><br>
The drudgery of work and its repetitive nature affect people mentally and has a dire effect also upon their health. Rather than adding to labour costs, increased holiday entitlement, in the long run, would be not only beneficial to employees' health but would mean a saving of money now spent on health benefits. We should have matters in perspective.<br><br>
Although these matters are left to national collective bargaining, it is a tribute to the trade unions and the employers, especially the more enlightened employers, that they have come to realise the importance of holidays and their effect on emotions. My own trade union, the Clerical and Administrative Workers' Union, now renamed APEX, of which my hon. Friend the Member for Small Heath has the honour of being president, and I have the privilege of being a member, has negotiated three weeks' holiday for 85 per cent. of its 120,000 members. Other unions have possibly done even better. We should recognise the success that has already been achieved.<br><br>
Nevertheless, it is necessary to face the facts and to say that this should be a statutory requirement. Comparisons have been made with conditions abroad. We are behind all other European countries in this respect. The drudgery of work affects the health of employees, and an increase in holiday entitlement would go a long way to reducing the costs involved in loss of work. It would also lead to more contented workers, which is an essential basis if we are to go forward in the new technological age.<br><br>
I welcome the Bill; I support it, and I congratulate my hon. Friend on choosing this subject, which is a vital issue in our social and industrial progress.</span></p>

<p>11 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on such an important Bill and to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) on having reached the Committee stage. We are discussing great issues of philosophy. We are really asking what is the purpose of increased productivity.<br><br>
Surely the answer to that is to increase and enhance our standard of living and to provide for more leisure. However, when one looks back over the last 60 years, one finds that in 1913 the average working week was 47·2 hours and in 1970 the working week—that is with overtime—has been reduced by only one hour, to 46·2 hours per week. Thus, in spite of the tremendous increase in productivity over the last 60 years, the working week has been reduced by only one hour. Holidays have increased from one week in 1913 to an average of two or two and a half weeks now.<br><br>
We all know that with the technological improvements taking place day in and day out, the labour force has contracted. The consequence is that we now have to talk seriously about rationing employment. During the war, for example, when products were scarce, they were rationed, to ensure that everyone had the opportunity to purchase them. Now employment is in short supply. We now have unemployment around the million mark and economists are talking of stabilising the figure at around ¾ million. If we are to ration employment, the best possible way is to reduce the working week and to extend holidays. We now have seriously to consider this proposition, because it is most important as to future economic situation.<br><br>
Most people would agree that those who get most satisfaction from their jobs—executives, university teachers, doctors, administrative workers, civil servants and so on—get five, six or even eight weeks' holiday. Those who get least satisfaction from their jobs—people who work on the conveyor belts in the motor car industry, for example—often get only two weeks' holiday per year. We must consider the impact of the lack of holidays on the life style of individuals.<br><br>

I read a few weeks ago some interesting statistics about the incidence of sickness among industrial workers. Over the last 10 years, sickness rates have gone up by approximately 40 per cent. More people are away from work due to sickness, 40 per cent. more, than ten years ago. I am certain that in many instances this is due to the monotonous nature of many jobs.<br><br>
It would be interesting to contrast the incidence of sickness—and many manual workers are not paid during periods of sickness—of people working in monotonous jobs, with no job satisfaction, with the incidence of sickness among people who have job satisfaction. I am a former trade union official. My hon. Friend the Member for Small Heath is the president of our union and he knows that we have good terms and conditions of employment as trade union officials. We can get full pay for three months if we are absent due to sickness, yet I can say, having worked for 15 years as a full-time official, that I did not have one day off due to sickness.<br><br>
Many people in monotonous jobs, without job satisfaction, if in such a situation, would readily avail themselves of any extra sickness payments that were going, because absence through sickness would be a relief from the monotony of their jobs. One finds that when one has job satisfaction, there is no need to use sickness to get a rest from monotony. In this situation two remedies may be applied. One would be to have a shorter working week. The remedy in Clause 1 is to have longer holidays.<br><br>
Another factor in increased production is that most working peope, those fortunate enough to be in jobs, have opportunities to travel. Young people particularly have the opportunity to travel abroad. If they have no leisure to do so, they are unable to avail themselves of the enhanced standard of living that arises from technological improvements. A great contribution would be made if the Bill were passed and opportunities given for increased holidays.<br><br>
Another feature is industrial unrest and how much of it may arise from job monotony. Surely people should have more leisure in order that they may benefit from the sun, and the air to fortify themselves against the monotony of their work.<br><br>
I conclude by congratulating my hon. Friend on having had the opportunity to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
introduce the Bill. I hope that the Clause will be passed. Even though opportunities may not exist in this Parliament to put the Bill on the Statute Book, I am certain that any Government with a rational approach to the problems of the future will have to consider similar legislation at some time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Dudley Smith)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As most Members of the Committee will know, I was not associated with the Second Reading of the Bill, but I have read the OFFICIAL REPORT. That was because the responsibilities of two Government Departments are involved, and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary for Health and Social Security spoke on Second Reading, so it was thought appropriate that I should come today to answer these debates and to put the view of the Government again, though the hon. Member promoting the Bill has heard it before.<br><br>
As the Committee will be aware, the prospects of the Bill reaching the Statute Book are extremely slim. That is not a criticism of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell), because it is out of his hands. Nevertheless, the debate on Second Reading was valuable and the hon. Gentleman made his remarks in a constructive and moderate way, as he has this morning. Although I will say that I cannot accept the Bill, as was made clear on Second Reading, none the less I will not advise my hon. Friend—I was going to say "my hon. Friends"—to vote against it. We see no virtue in dividing the Committee and making something of a farce of our proceedings. In the circumstances, it is sensible to have had another debate this morning, particularly on this Clause, to reiterate some of the arguments on what one hon. Member called a great philosophical question, because this is what it is.<br><br>
Clause 1 raises issues which straddle party viewpoints and cross the bounds of ordinary politics. I do not often agree with the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton), but I agree wholeheartedly with his view that boredom creates strife. We have all seen examples, and I suspect that there are many more that do not meet the light of day.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Small Heath said that many of our fellow human
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0393">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
beings were, in some respects, facing the treadmill society. I must not be too philosophical—it is bad for Government spokesmen for the danger is that one says things that one should not say. But this is a subject in which I have been particularly interested for a long time and on which I have spoken when in opposition. Undoubtedly, one of the big challenges that any Government of the future will have to face, with improved terms and conditions of work, more leisure, better standards of living for individuals, is boredom at work and lack of job satisfaction. There is a wealth of truth in the statement that if one is in a satisfying job, one is not so concerned with the number of hours worked.<br><br>
One <i>caveat</i> I would enter, which I do not make necessarily in justification of people in the professional classes or positions of great responsibility, is that, although one cannot work out averages, there are many people holding responsible jobs who push themselves extremely hard and reach a point of exhaustion, and they certainly need fairly long periods of recuperation. On the other hand, boredom in a job, even though fewer hours are involved, can be rather soul-destroying, and there is a case for reasonable periods of leave for individuals to recharge their batteries—to use a colloquialism—in order to face the problems of everyday life.<br><br>
The hon. Member put forward the case that the proposal before us would go some way towards solving the unemployment problem, and that anyway longer holidays were desirable in themselves. I would not dissent from the second statement. I think that longer holidays are desirable for the individual employee. We differ about whether the suggested method is the right one to achieve the end.<br><br>
I shall comment on unemployment in a moment, but we clearly do not oppose the objective of reducing unemployment. We may differ about the ways of achieving it, but, as the hon. Gentleman knows, great efforts have been made to reduce unemployment, and I felt there was a slightly sour note in his remarks about unemployment when he said that he thought that there had not been much reduction. The trend is now in the right direction, and I hope sincerely that it will be maintained. The last two reductions were considerably better than had been hoped for, and while
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
no one may be complacent—and, again, as is so often said in politics, one must not take one month's figures in isolation—while that trend is maintained, we may hope that the situation will be far more under control than it has been recently.<br><br>
On whether unemployment is structural, or, to use an accepted term, has conventional causes, we still have no evidence, although these matters are constantly under investigation, to show that the present unemployment is anything other than the conventional type caused by economic circumstances, but we should all be unwise if we did not take into account the technological changes which are occurring and the possibilities of structural unemployment being caused in the years ahead.<br><br>
The Government's view, like that of our predecessors, is that the terms and conditions of employment are matters for negotiation between employers and employees in the light of the circumstances of each industry. That applies especially to annual holidays, for detailed provisions as to their timing, length and payment vary considerably from industry to industry. In areas where the Government have stepped in to lay down particular provisions in the contracts of employment, it has normally been in order to ensure that minimum conditions were satisfied, as the Committee will know, in relation to safety and health, for example, or the length of notice required to terminate employment.<br><br>
We submit that there is no evidence that legislation is needed at present to ensure the provision of adequate holidays. Recent years have brought a considerable increase in annual holiday entitlements. All employees covered by national agreements are entitled to at least two weeks, and about three-quarters of them are now entitled to three weeks or more. It is significant that the TUC has not pressed for legislation on annual holidays.<br><br>
I am able to tell the Committee—and when I did this research, I, too, was surprised—that whereas in 1965 three-quarters of manual workers were entitled to two weeks' annual holiday and only 3 per cent. to three weeks or more, by the end of last year the latest time for which figures are available, only one-quarter were on two weeks and two-thirds were on three weeks or more. That is a considerable change over a comparatively short period. I think that hon. Members opposite will agree that the trend is certainly in the right direction.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0394">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
Secondly, there is the question of cost. I am advised that it is not possible to make any accurate estimate of the effect of imposing upon industry a minimum annual holiday entitlement of four weeks, as suggested in Clause 1, but that it might well be about 2 per cent. of the national wage bill. Unless this cost were fully offset by reduced levels of wage increases, it would have an immediate and disastrous effect upon labour costs and consequently upon prices. That is something that no Government could lightly contemplate, particularly at the present time. It is preferable that improvements should be sought through negotiations, so that the cost of extra holidays may be related to other improvements in conditions of employment.<br><br>
Thirdly, we do not believe that an increase in holiday entitlement would have the effect upon unemployment that the sponsors envisage, and which they put forward particularly on Second Reading. The cost of the proposal would inevitably prejudice the prospects for increased growth in the economy, and I believe that it would contribute directly to increased unemployment as firms were forced to economise in the use of labour. There would not necessarily be any increase in overall unemployment, but it remains to be demonstrated that the proposal would have any significant impact on the unemployment problem. I do not believe that the benefits envisaged by the sponsors would flow from it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While what the hon. Gentleman says may be true if taken in isolation, he will appreciate that the argument about unemployment concerns not only Clause 1, but the totality of the Bill, particularly Clause 3, which deals with early retirement. I am sure that he would not wish to isolate the unemployment argument in respect of one Clause rather than the whole Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I appreciate that: the hon. Member has made a fair point. I do not wish to go out of order, but I must tell him that my arguments with regard to the other Clause also lead us to the view that this is not a palliative for unemployment. I do not believe that the Bill in general provides an adequate means of helping to solve the unemployment problem. Certainly I do not think that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
holiday entitlement will have a significantly beneficial effect.<br><br>
I have no doubt that unions and employers will continue to negotiate increases in holiday entitlement for their members in the context of their annual negotiations over pay and conditions. I am sure that improvements which are appropriate to the circumstances of the individual industry and other improvements in the conditions of employment will be taken into account.<br><br>
I accept the sincerity with which the case has been put forward, and I do not detract from the idea that everyone has the right to adequate and worthwhile leave, but I believe the present system is the right one to secure better conditions for those employed in industry and elsewhere. In the circumstances, although I shall not seek to force a Division on the Clause, I must make it clear that its underlying premise could not be accepted by the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eric S. Heffer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's generosity in not calling for a Division will be noted by Opposition Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman so early. I want to make it clear that, although we are slightly outnumbered, this is not a snap decision. For all I knew, there would have been a full attendance of the Committee, and I should have given the same advice whether there was one Member or a full complement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heffer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not suggest that this is a snap decision or that the Minister's motives were determined by the number of Members in the Committee Room. However, I am sorry that the Government have decided not to accept the Bill, not even with their own Amendments. It is an important Bill and we all ought to be grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) for bringing it forward.<br><br>
At one moment I wondered whether I had wandered into a meeting of what used to be the Clerical and Administrative Workers Union, or at least a white collar organisation. I think that I may say that I represent the authentic manual workers, so I find it even more commendable that white-collar workers have come forward with such a Bill, since they already have the sort of holidays proposed.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0395">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
The Bill raises the question of the rôle of legislation. It has often been argued that it is not the duty of Governments to legislate on industrial relations. Some of us argue that it is not right for the Government to legislate in certain directions on industrial relations, but it is a longstanding argument. If my hon. Friends will read Tom Mann's memoirs, they will see that the arguments about the eight-hour day that took place within the Labour movement at that time were about whether there should be legislation, or whether it should be left to the trade union movement.<br><br>
To some extent this argument gets us nowhere. There is a powerful case both for certain types of legislation, and for such things as wages, holidays, fringe benefits and so on to be negotiated in lieu of legislation by Governments. It is interesting that the Bill has been presented by a leader of a trade union, for that indicates that the trade union movement increasingly is coming to the conclusion that we have to have legislation to ensure that workers get a fair deal on certain matters. Holidays are one such matter.<br><br>
The history of the struggle for holiday entitlement is interesting. In my own industry, the building industry, when I was first an apprentice one could take a week's holiday, but one did not get paid. One was told by the employer, "If you want a week's holiday, no one will stand in your way, but if you go, there is no pay".<br><br>
We progressed. We managed to get a week's holiday and then we had stamps fixed to a card. If one changed jobs a couple of times in a year, or fell sick, one did not get a stamp on one's card, and when the holiday period came round, one did not receive a full week's money. These were serious problems for workers. Over the years we have made some progress but it would have been much better if there had been legislation providing that all workers in all industries should have at least one week's paid holiday.<br><br>
I have not had any experience of the motor car industry. The first motor car factory I visited was Fords in Detroit; I remember the great slogan painted on the wall. It read "Smile". That was remarkable. Those lads were there all day long, like those in the Charlie Chaplin film, "Modern Times", and they put up the slogan "Smile". One can imagine
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
why: it was a reaction to the sort of life they led.<br><br>
A few years ago, when riveting was still widely used in shipyards, men worked in the hulk of a ship with riveters on the outside blasting away in their ears all day long. If a man was lucky, he had two weeks' holiday a year. When he went home at night, he was shattered, like a chap who digs holes with a pneumatic drill. Two weeks' holiday is an affront to such workers.<br><br>
A teacher needs refreshing. There is no argument about that—anyone who has seen a teacher at work, being trampled on by the young, knows that. So, too, do industrial workers in the shipyards, on the motor car assembly line, in a biscuit factory, on a building site, or wherever they are. They need at least the four weeks' entitlement proposed in the Bill.<br><br>
It is to some extent a philosophical question and I am sorry that the Minister felt that he could not pursue his philosophical ideas. I once debated with him at the Cambridge Union, and on that occasion he did pursue some of his philosophical ideas. We might have had the benefit of some good thinking had he done so today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: HANSARD was not present then, so I might have got away with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heffer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a pity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. R. C. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Who won?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heffer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He won.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Naturally.</span></p>
<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heffer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He won by a narrow margin: I think that they had packed the room.<br><br>
The case has been well made. Some of my hon. Friends have produced some excellent material. The excellent opening by my hon. Friend the Member for Small Heath, and the contributions of all my hon. Friends brought out information which ought to be widely disseminated. For example, it is a remarkable fact that since 1913 the reduction in real working hours is one hour. The same applies to the question of holiday entitlement.<br><br>
The Minister dismissed far too lightly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0396">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
the powerful argument that the proposal in Clause 1 will have an effect on unemployment. The last time we discussed unemployment in the House, the Prime Minister made the valid point—no one argued with him—that much unemployment today is technological unemployment. We argued, in my opinion rightly, that part of the present unemployment situation was due to Government policies; but no one will deny that within it, as part of our present level of unemployment, is the effect of the technological revolution. My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) brought this out clearly.<br><br>
In shipbuilding and ship repairing, and in other industries, there is a reduction in the labour force because of the technological revolution. We have to face that and do something positive about it. One way is to get growth in the industries, to develop new industries, and to retrain the workers. Another way is a reduction in working hours, longer holidays and, the point made by my hon. Friend, earlier retirement if people wish. We cannot dismiss it as easily as the Minister did this morning.<br><br>
I am certain that the Committee will pass the Clause, and I hope that the Government will have another look at it. They can rearrange their legislative programme even at this late stage. There are one or two Bills which have not been universally popular which could be removed, and then we could have a Bill of this kind, which would be universally popular and would have the support of hon. Members on both sides of the House, although it may not have the full support of the Government. Perhaps they could amend the Bill to bring it into line with their thinking. I ask that they think again about it. This has been an excellent first debate, and I hope that the Committee will continue in the same vein.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to intervene in the debate, but I do so for many reasons, mainly as a result of the Minister's reply to what has been said so far. I am especially interested, because I am the most recently elected Member on the Committee. Although, I am sure, my concern is no greater than the concern expressed by my hon. Friends, my memories of the pressures which they have described is that much fresher because it is only just a year since I was elected to the House of Commons.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
I was fortunate to have a job which gave me a great deal of satisfaction. It did not give me as much satisfaction as being a Member of Parliament, but I was fortunate in the work I was doing. Nevertheless, I agree entirely with everything that my hon. Friends have said about the need for greater holiday entitlement for people working in industry, not only on the shop floor but also in offices.<br><br>
Attention has already been drawn to the fact that several members of the Committee are members of the Clerical and Administrative Workers Union, which has now changed its name to APEX. They will agree that not all clerical workers enjoy the benefits which their union has managed to obtain for its members. Many people working in offices do not have as much as three weeks' holiday a year.<br><br>
I disagree with much of what the Minister said. He said that we have had an interesting debate. I agree that our proceedings have been interesting, but they have not been a debate. We are deprived of the presence of most Conservative members of the Committee, and the Minister has the embarrassment of not receiving much support from his hon. Friends.<br><br>
The Minister argued that the Government are in a similar position to that of their predecessors. During the last 12 months, I have noticed that whenever the Government have a weak case they always claim that they are only adopting the position taken up by their predecessors. I wish that the Government would stand on their own feet for a change.<br><br>
The Minister said that the Government's position, like that of their predecessors, was that this matter should be left to trade unions, and Parliament should intervene only to establish minimum conditions. This is exactly what my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) is trying to do with the Bill. There is nothing here to prevent the trade unions from obtaining greater holiday entitlement for their members, as the teachers' unions have already obtained. There is nothing to prevent trade unions working on behalf of their members. But it would buttress the position of those who, for one reason or another, do not receive such long holiday entitlement.<br><br>
The Minister drew attention to the progress which has been made in the last 10 or 15 years, but on his own figures 25 per cent. of employed people do not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0397">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
receive 3 weeks' holiday. That was the figure he mentioned. That is not good enough, and it is clear that there is need to provide a minimum holiday entitlement of 3 or 4 weeks. If the Government thought that the country's economy could not afford 4 weeks, they should have brought forward an Amendment.<br><br>
The Minister was inconsistent because he suggested that, although there are so few people who are not now getting longer holidays, through the efforts of their trade unions, nevertheless it would be a crippling burden for the country's economy to give to that minority the benefits which my hon. Friend's Bill would provide.<br><br>
The Minister cannot have it both ways. The Government cannot, on the one hand, maintain that the Bill is not necessary because so few people need it, and then, on the other, maintain that to accept the Bill would retard our growth, would prevent or hinder the reduction in unemployment, and all the other scares that the Minister put forward. I thought he was being unfair there, particularly in view of what he described as the moderate way in which my hon. Friend had presented the Bill.<br><br>
The arguments that the Minister put forward today have been used against every action taken by Parliament to improve working conditions. I should certainly not suggest that the Minister would defend the use of child labour, but it is fair to say that that sort of argument, that the country's economy could not afford it, was used 100 years ago when Members of Parliament were asking for greater protection of children. The same sort of thing happened with the Factories Acts. We have heard these arguments so often, and I am rather disappointed that the Government should have brought them up again this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before formally putting the Question, I should like to tender my personal apologies to the hon. Members for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis), for Gower (Mr. Ifor Davies), and for Darlington (Mr. Ted Fletcher) for confusing their names earlier. I must confess that, having fumbled for the name of the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton), I had a map drawn so that I should not again be in that dilemma, but, having a poor bump of locality, I then proceeded to misread it.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed</i>, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. R. C. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I make one brief comment on the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis)? In the teaching profession, the holidays are primarily for the benefit and convenience of the children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about the parents?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the Clause is to extend to eight the number of statutory holidays in a year. As the Committee may have seen, I attempted to amend "eight" to "ten", but, through my own inefficiency, that Amendment has had to be ruled out of order. But it will be seen that, although I regard the Clause as a step in the right direction—I am sure that my hon. Friend would regard it as a very first step—there are other steps which could and should be taken.<br><br>
Clause 1 refers to holidays in one period, whether two fortnights or one month, when someone may get right away from work and relax, go to the seaside and the beautiful sunshine—not this year, perhaps, but normally. The purpose of individual day holidays spread throughout the year is to enable one to get away from the boredom and routine and have a day off. It is as simple as that.<br><br>
I remember much criticism, a few years age, when a number of workers, off their own bat, took New Year's Day as an extra holiday. The Press, and the Conservative Party, too, made great play about the lazy workers of this country having taken the day off, and so on. We were compared to our friends in Germany and Japan, who were held up as the hard-working people, and we as the lazy ones.<br><br>
I have done a little research into what happens in other countries with annual statutory holidays and I have found some interesting figures. We are, presumably,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0398">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
shortly to enter the Common Market. Whether we are to rush in joyously or be dragged in kicking and screaming depends on one's viewpoint, but it makes no difference to my argument. It has often been said by the Government—I have heard the Prime Minister say it—that we are going into Europe to give a lead. Before we can give a lead, we must catch up, and on annual holidays we are a long way behind.<br><br>
Let me give some examples. Belgium already has, by the law of 2nd April, 1947–25 years ago—10 public holidays a year. In France at present there are nine, covered by several Acts and decrees. In Germany, depending on the province, as holidays are fixed by Länder, they vary between 10 and 13 a year. The Italians, with their large number of saints, have 16 holidays a year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think it is 17.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it? I have missed one out in my list. These date back to 1949 and 1954: there are St. Peter, St. Paul, St. Joseph, Corpus Christi, the Immaculate Conception—masses of them. I accept the Minister's suggestion that there are 17.<br><br>
Luxembourg has 10. The Netherlands are rather behind on this, and I think we should give them a good example. As far as I can see, they have no statutory holidays, but there are about seven which are generally recognised as public holidays. I see my figures are being checked very carefully.<br><br>
Those are the Common Market countries. Let us go outside them, to Japan. Here is a nation where everyone is supposed to work 24 hours a day. They have 12, including some very interesting ones, if I may read one or two. The 15th January is Adults Day. Then, of course, they celebrate the Emperor's birth. On 5th May they have Children Day. On 15th September, Respect for the Aged Day. On 10th October, Health-sports Day. On 3rd November, Culture Day.<br><br>
Let us pass from Japan to the United States. It varies, again, between State and State. There are certain Federal legal public holidays. I understand that they can be legally designated only for the District of Columbia and for federal employees, but they are taken up normally by most States. There are nine at least, and probably more in some States.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
Behind, as in most things, are most of the Communist countries. As far as I can find out, the only legal public holidays in the Soviet Union are eight. There are two days for the anniversary of the Socialist revolution. Perhaps, one day, we shall be able to add a couple of days to celebrate the anniversary of the Socialist revolution in this country, whenever it comes. You, Miss Quennell, will be interested to know that in at least one respect the USSR is ahead of us, celebrating 8th March as International Women's Day. That is an excellent example for this country to follow.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
Those figures show clearly that we lag badly behind most other industrialised countries. There seems to be no difficulty in finding reasons for having public holidays. The Bill already makes New Year's Day a statutory holiday. That, I think, we can all agree about. But nearly all European countries celebrate, as a statutory holiday, 1st May as Labour Day. I see no reason why we should not have 1st May as Labour Day. I suggest it to the Government as something they could take up and introduce early next year even if the Bill does not go through.<br><br>
If we do go into the Common Market, should we not have a Europe Day? According to one's views, it could be a day of mourning or a day of celebration. But, in either case, it could be a day's holiday. I put that seriously to the Minister and hope that he will pass it to the Prime Minister, who is anxious to celebrate our entry into Europe. How better to celebrate it than to have a Europe Day? It might have its advantages, too, because if a future Government wanted to take Britain out of the Common Market, they might meet some resistance, as it would lose a day's holiday.<br><br>
We could have the Prime Minister's birthday; that would be a variable or moving feast day, I suppose. It might be a little awkward, because we should be reluctant to chose a Prime Minister whose birthday feel on one of the existing statutory holidays—and even more so if it fell on 29th February.<br><br>
I believe strongly that we should catch up with the rest of Europe and most industrialised nations in this matter of statutory day holidays. The Clause proposes eight, which I fully support. But, if my hon. Friend has to reintroduce
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0399">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
the Bill, because it falls now through lack of parliamentary time, I hope that he will substitute 10 for eight. We ought to be at least level with the rest of Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. R. C. Mitchell) for speaking first on the Clause in such a comprehensive manner. I congratulate him on the formidable amount of research he has done.<br><br>
I hope that this Clause receives a little more sympathy from the Minister than did Clause 1. Although he asked the Committee to reject Clause 1, and was not able to find merit in it as regards assistance on the unemployment problem, it is fair to say that he found some merit in it in the justification for holidays for their own sake and because of the pressures of life.<br><br>
I hope, however, that on this occasion the Minister will not resort to the argument he used on the Clause 1, the effect that it is happening anyway—leave it to the unions, but, if it is passed into law, it will add 2 per cent. to the wage bill. That seemed to be a contradictory argument, which one does not expect to find in Ministerial thinking—certainly not in the same speech. We are used in this Parliament to Ministers contradicting themselves on successive days, but we have hardly become accustomed to their doing so in the same speech in the course of half an hour.<br><br>
If it is happening anyway, and is a desirable thing for the trade unions to allow to occur, the question of the amount on the wage bill is not a valid argument for the Government to make, especially having regard to the impositions on the cost of living which they are creating in many other ways, which it would be out of order for me to talk about now.<br><br>
The Minister relied to a certain extent on the fact that two-thirds of the population now have three weeks' holiday. But the one-third—this is relevant to the point—and Clause 2—who still do not have three weeks are the very people who should be at the top of our list of priorities for increased holidays. It is for those people that the Bill is designed.<br><br>
During my researches on the question of statutory bank holidays, my legal advisers drew my attention to the great complexity of the law in respect of statutory holidays. It differs as between
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
Scotland and England, for example, and it seems to be dominated more by banking and financial dealings than by other considerations. One, therefore, encounters a certain amount of difficulty. However, I think that in Clause 2 we have managed to sort it out in a reasonably intelligent way. If the Government only approve of this Clause, we shall have achieved something. If I have not drafted it quite correctly, or if they prefer some other form of words, I am sure that the Committee will be happy to accommodate them in that respect.<br><br>
On Second Reading—this is column 856 of HANSARD of 18th February—the Minister then in charge told us that activities were afoot in respect of this matter. We were told that on 11th February a meeting took place between the Department of Employment and the TUC to discuss the number of bank holidays that we should have. The Government undertook to examine sympathetically what the TUC suggested, which was this very proposal of mine, for two additional bank holidays. That was four months ago.<br><br>
I hope that today the Minister will tell us the result of the Government's examination of the TUC proposal. If it has been sympathetically received, and there is general agreement that the number of statutory bank holidays should be increased, it is not unreasonable to expect the Minister to tell us that that point is conceded and that, if the Government cannot accept the Clause in this Bill, they will introduce another Bill or an Amendment to existing legislation to implement the proposal.<br><br>
I am sorry that the Amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Itchen to increase the number of bank holidays to 10 is not in order. From the powerful case that he made this morning, it is clear that his proposal could not be more modest, and that in this situation it would have been better to accept such an Amendment. As he rightly said, it is hardly excessive when compared with the position in Japan—probably one of our greatest competitors now—or in some of the Common Market countries with which we shall have to work in the future in conditions of reasonable competition.<br><br>
I do not think that it is an exaggeration to say that, if we go into Europe, the EEC countries will undoubtedly require us to have longer holidays, more bank
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0400">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
holidays, and possibly a shorter working week, so that we may defend ourselves against the charge that we are competing unfairly with them by relying upon sweated labour and not giving our workers the benefits which their counterparts in Europe receive. And that, to any trade union, is a very powerful argument indeed.<br><br>
To take up my hon. Friend's point about New Year's Day, when I came to draft the Bill I was staggered to find, first, that Christmas Day is not a bank holiday in Scotland, and, second, the increasing incidence of absenteeism on New Year's Day in England and Wales. When one has a festive occasion, as celebrating the new year always is, full of hope and joy and new opportunity, it is natural that there should be an aftermath to such national festivities. If we are to increase the number of bank holidays, that would be a sensible choice. It is clearly what the nation wants. People want to lie in on New Year's Day to recover from the festivities of the night before. In return, we should suggest to our Scottish friends, who are no less religious or Christian than we are in England and Wales, that the celebration of Christ's birth should be an annual holiday for them. I do not think that the choice of Christmas Day in Scotland and New Year's Day in England and Wales would cause controversy.<br><br>
We should have more holidays, but it is difficult to say when they should be. I, personally, favour the autumn. There is a long haul between midsummer and Christmas when a holiday entitlement would make sense. It is interesting to note that, every time one reduces the hours of work or increases holidays in this country, productivity goes up in industry. There is a lesson to be learned from that. This is not only a Bill for extended holidays and early retirement; it is a Bill for greater productivity, too, because the two are closely linked.<br><br>
Personally, I would favour an extra holiday between the annual works holiday, which in my part of the world is in July, and Christmas. If there is any difficulty about it, I modestly suggest to the Minister that I was born on 4th September. A "St. Denis" Day to commemorate the author of the Act might not be out of place, although, of course, the Minister or the Committee may have even better alternatives to suggest.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Guy Fawkes Day.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not quite understand what my hon. Friends are suggesting over there. This is the one Clause of the Bill that received a sympathetic response from the Minister on Second Reading. I, therefore, hope that we shall be given something constructive, and that the Under-Secretary may accept the Clause or at any rate tell us that the principle is acceptable and legislation will follow rapidly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the drawbacks of appearing in Committees such as this, where the atmosphere is so cordial and the speeches friendly as well as constructive, is that one may almost be seduced into giving way, wishing to respond to hon. Members. As the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) probably suspects, I have a disappointment for him. I made clear at the outset that I could not on behalf of the Government accept the Bill in its totality, although that is not to say that there is no validity in some of the arguments put forward.<br><br>
I am a little sad that the hon. Member thinks that I was inconsistent in my reply to Clause 1, because in some respects the same arguments apply to Clause 2. I said that the question of holidays—I think that this includes the question of public holidays—is best left to negotiations between the two sides in industry, which vary from industry to industry, rather than be the subject of statutory obligation. I pointed out also that if the Bill were implemented, so I am told on the best advice, it would involve up to 2 per cent. increase immediately. That is a very large sum to absorb at once, and the effect would be most inflationary. It is fair to make that point. That is why I stick to what I said originally.<br><br>
The Government's attitude towards the increase in the number of holidays provided under Clause 2 is the same as their attitude to Clause 1. At the risk of irritating the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis), I must say that it has been the policy of successive Administrations, including that of the last Labour Government, that holidays, which form an important part of the package of pay and conditions of employment—a fact recognised by all hon. Members—should where possible be negotiated by the normal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0401">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
procedure of collective bargaining by the employers and trade unions directly concerned, without the intervention of the Government. It is better that they should be regulated in that way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But that cannot be true, because bank holidays are determined by Statute. They are determined by the Banking and Financial Dealings Act, 1971. How can it be argued that this should be left to collective bargaining when it is the one aspect of our public holidays which is determined by statute?</span></p>
<p>12 noon.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that. Bank holidays are a separate issue. We are talking now on the theme of public holidays generally, in addition to the agreed amount of leave which workers are able to negotiate with their employers.<br><br>
The cost of additional holidays and their contribution to wage inflation must be considered. Fixed one-day holidays may cost disproportionately more than holidays taken on a rota system, because they may involve extra expenditure on shutting down and starting up a manufacturing process. The cost of any improvements in holidays should be taken into account and negotiated within the context of the general settlement of pay and conditions.<br><br>
The second effect of Clause 2, as the hon. Member told us, would be to change the present bank holidays into statutory holidays. The present bank holidays are nothing more than their name implies, and such days are recognised as holidays by industry and commerce generally only by custom and practice, reinforced by numerous collective agreements and individual contracts and, in some industries, by wages council negotiations. In Scotland, the position is different from that in England and Wales.<br><br>
This matter was debated during the passage of the Banking and Financial Dealings Bill through the House as recently as November last, as some hon. Members will remember. My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, who was then Minister of State at the Treasury, told the House on that occasion that the Government had given serious consideration to the question of legislating for public holidays rather than bank holidays and that they had come to the conclusion that it was best to leave the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
institution of bank holidays as it was. The House agreed on that occasion, subject to the changes introduced by that Bill.<br><br>
The reasons were, first, that serious difficulties would arise in Scotland if the various traditional local holidays all had to be taken on the same days; second, there was the complicated question of providing for exceptions for those who had to work anyway on the statutory holidays; and, finally—this is perhaps the most significant factor—the institution of statutory holidays in place of bank holidays would be an exceedingly inflexible arrangement. Unless such extensive exceptions were provided then the effect of the legislation would be largely nullified, there would be a great increase in traffic congestion and over-crowding of holiday resorts which are the inevitable accompaniment of fixed holidays.<br><br>
The hon. Member mentioned what was said by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security, on Second Reading, when he referred to the consideration which my Department was giving to this question. I reiterate what my hon. Friend said on that occasion. This matter is being looked at by the Department, carefully and without commitment. The hon. Member may chide me and say that this was said four months ago. Sometimes, it is not easy to reach decisions with great rapidity. Not so very long has passed in parliamentary time since that debate took place, and I assure the hon. Member that the matter is still being examined. It has not just been cast out of the window. I ask him to accept that in good faith.<br><br>
I acknowledge what was said by the hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. R. C. Mitchell) about Common Market countries having rather more holidays than we have. The time may come when there will be some regularisation. As he said, in presenting his interesting figures, there is no uniformity among the Common Market countries. There is a wide disparity, from Italy with an abnormally large number of religious festivals, down to—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Netherlands. They all do better than we do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Netherlands do better by about one day. But if one looks at the situation overall there is no exclusive pattern in this respect.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0402">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
At the moment, the arguments that I put forward fall into line with the arguments which are put on Clause 1. In the circumstances, although, again, I shall not vote against the Clause, I feel that it would be wiser not to accept its premises.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very disappointed by the Minister's reply. I thought that he would have taken this opportunity to report to the Committee on the discussions which had taken place between the Ministry and the TUC on the question of statutory holidays. Three or four months have elapsed, and this would have been an ideal opportunity for him to state the Government's view on the representations made to him by the TUC. But all we had was a scraping of the barrel to produce arguments as to why it is impossible to make any concession on the very modest proposal—eight is too modest—put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell).<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. R. C. Mitchell) has outlined the situation on the Continent of Europe and in the world generally. The Minister cannot pretend that the competitive edge of our exporters would be lost if an extra two statutory days' holiday were granted. We are competing in many cases with countries which grant 25 or even 50 per cent. more statutory holidays than we do, and in many cases have longer annual holidays than we do.<br><br>
The question of cost does not enter into it. It is well known that if people have shorter working hours, if their labour is compressed into a shorter period, they work harder. A graphic illustration of this followed the miners' strike. The miners had been out of work because of an industrial dispute. Immediately they returned to work, production went up by 20 per cent. in the first week. Everyone said that it would take two or three weeks before coal would get to the power stations, but after their long lay-off they immediately increased production by a record amount.<br><br>
That often happens when there is a reduction of the working week. People tend to expend their labour to meet the number of hours that are required. It is Parkinson's law. If the number of hours is reduced, either by a reduction in the working week or by increased holidays, the expenditure of labour tends to fit the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
time available. So there is no question of 2 per cent. addition to the wages bill. History has shown, in fact, that it does not happen.<br><br>
Reference was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Itchen to the question of a European Day. The Prime Minister has answered Questions in the House as to a suitable method of celebrating our entry into Europe. I am against entering Europe on the present terms, but I should have no objection to a holiday to mark the occasion, perhaps with bonfires in the streets—though I would accept no responsibility if an effigy of the Prime Minister were burned on the bonfires.<br><br>
May Day is one international day which is celebrated almost throughout the world, but hardly at all in this country. May Day is celebrated not only in Communist countries, with massive parades and demonstrations, but in all the European countries, in Japan, and in the United States. In the majority of these countries, May Day is a statutory holiday. It is international day. It was promulgated by the first International Working Men's Association in the 1880s. It is celebrated in this country by marches of the trade unions and the Labour movement on the Sunday following or preceding 1st May. We have an opportunity here to devote at least one statutory holiday to the celebration of May Day in this country as it is celebrated abroad.<br><br>
I am not satisfied by the Minister's reply. He has not answered the case put in great detail by my hon. Friend the Member for Itchen. We ask again what action has been taken as a result of the meeting with the TUC. Has he anything to report to the Committee? Can he tell us what progress has been made?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I made clear that careful consideration is still being given to this matter. I cannot say more than that, and I am sure that the hon. Member will not expect me to do so in advance of conclusions. When Governments have such consultations, they do not anticipate the ultimate decision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a standard answer from anyone who is trying to avoid coming to a conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0403">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One could understand it if the meeting took place yesterday; one could say that there has not been time to look at the matter. But the meeting took place four months ago. If the Minister has nothing to report, will he tell us how long the consideration will take? May we expect an answer in six months, twelve months, or two years? It is not good enough for him to say that the matter is still under consideration.<br><br>
The Government are trying to rebuild their bridges with the TUC after the appalling experience of the Industrial Relations Act, which brought relations between them almost to breaking point. Here is an opportunity to say to the TUC, "We have considered your representations. These are our proposals. We are prepared to go half-way to meet you, or to make some concession", or to be frank and say, "Having considered the matter, we are not prepared to take any initiative in this respect".<br><br>
We are entitled to an answer and I ask the Minister to intervene once again and tell us how long the consideration will take.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ifor Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important that the Minister should appreciate that he has disappointed and depressed us. He did not even say that he agreed with the principle. He used arguments directly opposing the proposal. My hon. Friends have put the case admirably, and have suggested various days. In passing, may I suggest another one, a Welsh Day.<br><br>
The Minister bases his case on cost—I think he talked about 2 per cent.—but I impress upon him the need to look at the other side of the coin. The expectation of a break in working routine is a reviver in itself. I remember the days when people argued against tea-breaks in industry. Long were the arguments of employers about the time that would be wasted, the cost, and all the rest. Yet no sane employer today would argue against tea-breaks, because he knows that it is a help for industry, it is a reviver, and, in many cases, an inspiration to get on with the job. Such arguments are out of date, and I ask the Minister to realise that we are serious in our contention that an increase in statutory holidays would be to the advantage of the work force.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) emphasised the importance of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
the Bill not only from the point of view of social improvement but from the point of view of productivity. I have not the slightest doubt that an increase in statutory holidays would increase the incentive to work. How it should be done, and what should be the days, are matters of detail. Surely, the Minister can agree, in principle, that there should be an increase in the miserable number of statutory holidays that we have compared with other countries. His reply was depressing, and he did less than justice to the case that has been made.</span></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Havers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I only intervene for a moment, partly to bring disappointing news to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell). His birthday is on 4th September, and the August Bank Holiday is on the last Monday in August. Unless that bank holiday is changed, he has little chance of having his birthday as one of the national holidays.<br><br>
I was not surprised by the number of foreign holidays enumerated by the hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. R. C. Mitchell). When I am on holiday abroad, it always seems that every day is a national holiday.<br><br>
I disagree with my hon. Friend about new year's day. I am of opinion that new year's day ought to be a holiday, that one should recognise what goes on. In many parts of England, new year's day is treated as a national holiday, even though, strictly, it is not. But I should need a lot more convincing about more days than that. If the Amendment which was sought to be made had been carried, the four national saints' days might have done, but, curiously enough, three of them fall between 1st March and 23rd April, and the last on 30th November. I should prefer any extra days to be in the summer. If we are to have a Labour Day, I suggest that the other should be Derby Day.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We wish to facilitate the progress of the Committee, though it is regrettable that we have only three-quarters of an hour left this morning to deal with this most important Clause.<br><br>
The Clause would allow people to receive a retirement pension up to five years earlier than at present, by an Order of the Minister. In all my 17 years' Membership of the House, I have never received such a volume of correspondence, from all sorts of people, overwhelmingly supporting the proposal. Although the Second Reading took place on 18th February, the correspondence still continues. One of the reasons is that there was a great deal in the Press about the Bill when it was introduced, and on Second Reading, but only the "quality" newspapers reported what happened to it. People keep writing to me and asking what has happened to this wonderful Bill and when earlier retirement will be possible.<br><br>
Each year, 275,000 men and 174,000 women retire. That is the extent of the contribution that could be made to the unemployment problem. I do not propose compulsory retirement. It is a matter of free choice. That number of people would not retire necessarily if the retirement age was brought down, although I assume from my correspondence that about half of them would.<br><br>
One of the reasons comes out in the letters which many people write to me, telling heart-rendering stories of how their husbands died almost immediately they retired, or in the last five years of their working life, and never had the opportunity to enjoy their retirement.<br><br>
The one fact which has emerged from our discussion is that our present old-age pensions scheme is thoroughly bogus. It is a national scandal. I have discovered that the expectation of life at birth for a man in this country is 68 years, and for a woman it is 72. On Second Reading, the Minister told me that the expectation of life for a man at retirement, if he retires at 65, is another 12 years, which puts his age at death at 77; and for a woman who retires at 60 it is 19 years, making the age at death 79.<br><br>
As I pointed out on Second Reading, if we want the facts about the bogus nature of our old-age pension proposals, what we really need to know is neither of those things but the expectation of life at the moment when somebody moves
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
into industry. Putting it at halfway between the expectation of life at birth and the expectation of life on retirement, it means that when a man or woman enters employment on leaving school, under our present arrangements they will contribute for 40 years to a pension fund with the expectation of eight years' benefit for a man or ten years' for a woman.<br><br>
If that is not a bogus operation, I should like to know what is. There is hardly another aspect of our national life in which we expect such a lengthy contribution for such little return. The reason is to be found in the remarkable language of the Department of Health and Social Security in one or two letters which I quoted on Second Reading. I shall quote one sentence again from the sort of letters which Ministers have been writing to hon. Members who have urged them to reduce the age. This is really the governmental case—using that word with a small "g". The case is that pensions are payable to those who
<br><blockquote><p>"can no longer be reasonably expected to continue at work".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 18th February, 1972; Vol. 831, <i>c</i>. 784.]</p></blockquote>
In other words, our pension arrangements are not pension arrangements at all. They are insurance facilities against inability to continue in work. We have not got a retirement policy. We have not got retirement pensions. We have national insurance arrangements to insure people in the context of their reasonable expectation of being able to continue in work. One has only to state the proposition in those terms—it is official language which I am using—to see the total unacceptability of our present arrangements.<br><br>
I shall not argue the case on unemployment. I turn now to the question of cost. The Minister told us on Second Reading that, if my proposals were implemented, the full cost of early retirement would be £700 million, which he calculated as calling for an additional contribution of 5p a week for every man earning £20 a week, or 60p for a man earning £42. Those figures accord with the information which I have been given by the TUC, and by the APEX actuary who has kindly supplied me with information, so there is no quarrel between us about that. The nation overwhelmingly would think it worthwhile for a manual worker to pay an extra 5p a week
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0405">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 39</span>
to have the opportunity of retiring five years earlier. The overwhelming evidence is that most working men would wish to retire earlier.<br><br>
The Minister may argue today that we would not know what to do with the leisure if we had it. This was an extraordinary feature of his hon. Friend's speech on Second Reading. As I spent six years as a Minister dealing with sport, recreation and leisure, I was staggered to be met by that argument. Both this Government and the last committed themselves to the view that increased leisure and the opportunities for it are part of the national scene. In the House of Commons yesterday, the Prime Minister told us that our cultural heritage is greater than that of any other part of the world. He put it higher than I would have done.<br><br>
It is hardly an argument for Ministers to use here that people cannot be relied upon to spend their leisure effectively. That is not my experience when I go round the country, although, as I said on Second Reading, to the extent that it does happen, it is probably a by-product of the education system. We have a degree of hooliganism among young people because our education system is excessively concentrated on passing examinations rather than on teaching people how to live, which should be its prime purpose. I hope that the argument about leisure does not feature too prominently in the Minister's reply today.<br><br>
The Minister told me that, on technical grounds, this Clause is unacceptable to him. I can understand that, because we had great difficulty in drafting it—first, in getting it into a Private Member's Bill without a Money Resolution, and, second, because we realised that a proposal to reduce the retirement age by five years could not be put on the Statute Book overnight. It would create some havoc in industry if it were. This is why I gave the Government the opportunity to come forward with an Order in Council, or something of the sort, to reduce progressively the age at which retirement pension should be paid.<br><br>
I turn for a moment to the unemployment problem. The Minister has told us that the drop in the last two months was better than the Government had hoped for. This shows the state of mind into which they have got themselves. The drop in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
unemployment may be better than the Government had hoped for, but it certainly does not meet our expectations on this side. As my hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Ted Fletcher) said earlier, economists are trying to brainwash the nation into accepting ¾ million as being a satisfactory level of unemployment. The present indications, even on this month's figures, are that we shall not get anywhere near to ¾ million. There may be a further drop in July, but by August and September the seasonal work will be over and the figure will start to move upwards again in a manner unacceptable to us all.<br><br>
I regard early retirement as a right which the nation has earned by increased productivity, which people should enjoy, and I regard the present pension arrangements as bogus, but I must say today that the case in relation to inherent unemployment and technological unemployment is far stronger than I thought on Second Reading four months ago.<br><br>
It is now apparent, after all the Government have done to try to get the economy moving, that we are stuck with a much higher level of unemployment than any of us find acceptable. The truth is that very few of us in the House know what to do about it. If that be so, it supports the case we have been making this morning, that much of it is structural and technological unemployment, and it can be dealt with only by having a social revolution to match the technological revolution which has gone before.<br><br>
For all those reasons, I commend the Clause to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has raised an extremely important matter, again highlighting the inadequacy of research facilities available not only to Members but to Governments. To have a debate on a matter of such crucial importance and try to put it into half an hour is absurd.<br><br>
I am not surprised that my hon. Friend has had correspondence on this matter. We have all had it. I have had it in connection with the National Insurance Bill, on which I am currently sitting on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I was interested in my hon. Friend's figure of £700 million; that figure is familiar to me in another context because, when we were debating our Amendments to the National Insurance Bill, the Minister said that the cost would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0406">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
be £700 million. This figure seems to be the magic key that locks all the doors to advancement.<br><br>
The junior Minister at the Department of Health and Social Security produced similar figures. He worked out how much the contribution would have to be increased to the £20-a-week worker and the £42-a-week worker. He went up to £48, which is the new upper limit in the graduated scheme. I pointed out then, and I point out now, that this presumes that national insurance schemes are to be financed for ever and aye by a tripartite system—Exchequer contributions, employer contributions and employee contributions. That is not necessarily so, and the Labour Party is currently at work on trying to find different and more fair methods by which these social service improvements can be put into effect.<br><br>
I do not accept the argument that says simply that the £20-a-week man will have to pay 5p extra and the £42-a-week man will have to pay 60p extra. And, even if I did, I think that my hon. Friend is right. These workers would gladly accept that if they had the opportunity to retire five years earlier.<br><br>
On the other hand, it would create certain problems. As a proportion of the total numbers concerned, there will be more people retired who are unhappy in their retirement than there are people at work who are unhappy. I have talked to retired people who have found the great drop in income, the enormous increase in financial problems, the loss of the fellowship at work, getting in the old woman's way at home—all kinds of problems. If my hon. Friend asks for the retirement age to be reduced, then there must be an increase in leisure facilities for old and retired people, facilities different from those with which my hon. Friend was concerned, and also an increase in the money available to them to enable them to enjoy such facilities. It means increased pensions as well as increased leisure facilities for this age group.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has raised an extremely important point, which I intended to mention, that nobody wants greater leisure for all people on the present pitifully inadequate pension. When I was Minister for sport, I spent some time on education for retirement and the provision of recreation facilities in retirement. The extraordinary thing is that it would not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
cost much. In this country, there are thousands of church halls, sports club buildings and the like which stand empty in the middle of the week, especially in the daytime when elderly people would like to use them.<br><br>
It is interesting that there has been a great drop in the use of industrial sports facilities. It is now beginning to pick up again, but it is almost exclusively concentrated on the weekend. We need an imaginative scheme to get industrial sports and welfare clubs to open up their facilities for our senior citizens in retirement to enjoy them in the week.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, my hon. Friend shows that these problems are so involved and spread over so many aspects that it is impossible to have an intelligent debate in the time available to us.<br><br>
I ask the Minister some simple questions. First, what research is being done into this problem? For instance, are there facts and figures to show how the incidence of scheduled industrial diseases increases with the onset of age? Is there a bigger incidence among the 60 to 65 age group as compared with other age groups? Is research being done on the decrease in productivity of older workers? Clearly, it must be so in heavy manual work, and it may well be that there could be differentiation in this matter as between those who are classified as heavy industrial workers and others.<br><br>
Obviously, a miner cannot do anything other than a light job at the age of 65. I know some miners who work up to the age of 70, but they are doing light work, and they are happy at it. However, their productivity is light. Whereas, here in the House where we are not doing manual work, there are the gay old boys, like Manny Shinwell, who go on cheerfully beyond 80 and even have time to marry a third time in addition. This is a difference between one set of workers and another.<br><br>
We are groping in the dark here because we do not know the facts. The Minister gave a figure of 2 per cent. increase in industrial costs. Neither I, nor anyone else in the Committee, is in a position to challenge that figure—the civil servants say, "Throw 2 per cent. at them and they will accept it". I do not know how it is worked out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about productivity?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0407">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 43</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are great complications when a Committee of this kind has to discuss these matters. I do not think that Standing Committees are appropriate to investigate this kind of problem. We should have many more pre-legislation Committees for this purpose, to go into all the evidence, to study the research which has been done, and to present proposals either in the form of legislation or in a suggested form on which the Parliamentary draftsment could base the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that Standing Committees are often not the best place to discuss in detail profound questions like this, with great social implications. On the other hand, it does no harm occasionally if hon. Members discuss them, perhaps only superficially, from time to time in the context of legislation.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) asked what research is being done into scheduled industrial diseases among old people. I must be honest with him. I cannot tell him off the cuff exactly what is being done. Some research is going on; I will find out exactly what is being done and I will write to him about it. It is important, I agree.<br><br>
We all realise that in certain hard jobs one is much more prone, the longer one is exposed to unpleasant conditions, to contract diseases, or to become crippled. Again, disease is an insidious thing which can strike down people in jobs which are fairly congenial, and yet others will survive to a ripe old age even though they may have had a very hard working life. It is an interesting point.<br><br>
Again, this touches on the broad philosophical problem of what should be done about people when they retire and at what age they should retire. It is bound up with whether they will have enough money to be able to live with dignity and to enjoy their later years and what avenues are open to them for leisure occupations and activities to keep them occupied so that they do not just vegetate at home and sit in a chair in front of the television—if they can still afford to have one. These are questions which are beyond the scope of this debate.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Small Heath chided me about the unemployment figures. He was entitled to say that they should come down even more. They
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
will come down even more, but he should not under-estimate the present figures. The figure of wholly unemployed in April was 912,000 and this figure came down in June to 758,000, which is a good improvement. No one is complacent about this, least of all the Government. We wish to improve the situation, but, as he himself and others fairly recognised, it is a situation to which there is no easy answer. It is a matter of concern to us all, and in the public interest we must get this figure down as low as possible.<br><br>
Quite fairly, the hon. Member put forward as one of the main arguments in support of the Clause the fact that it would have an effect on unemployment. Clearly, it would have some effect on unemployment, but it is impossible to say with any reasonable accuracy what the effect would be. The national insurance pension age is only one of the factors that help to influence a person's decision whether to retire. Other factors come into account, such as the amount of the pension involved or the savings of the individual.<br><br>
Everything is personal to the individual. The effect of employers' practices and occupational pension schemes have to be taken into account. Because many schemes have adopted the same age as the national insurance scheme it does not necessarily follow that they would reduce that age if the national insurance age were reduced. Funded schemes certainly could not do so in the short term without drastically reducing the pensions that they pay. The people who would immediately benefit by the reduction in the present minimum pensionable age which is proposed are those such as civil servants, teachers and bank and insurance officials, who already often retire with substantial pensions. It might appeal to the hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. R. C. Mitchell), but many others would not agree that those were the best categories to put forward as an example.<br><br>
Overridingly, there is the cost. Again, it is a philosophical argument whether the basis of the way in which the money for the payment of pensions is raised should be changed and what level pensions should be. We all subscribe to the idea that people are entitled to a decent pension and that society should give them as much as it can possibly afford. But in dealing with present realities, assuming that the pattern of retirement at the lower retirement age would be the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0408">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
same as it is under the existing age limits, the cost of reducing the minimum retirement age to 63 at present rates would be about £250 million a year. That answers the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton).<br><br>
That would be an increase in contributions ranging from 2p a week on the £20-a-week man to about 25p a week on the £42-a-week man, and I confirm what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said on Second Reading—that to reduce the age to 60 would cost about £700 million a year and would mean increases in contributions ranging from about 5p a week on the £20-a-week man to about 60p a week on the £42-a-week man. The hon. Member for Small Heath thinks that that would be overwhelmingly welcomed by those who would have to pay those contributions. I am not sure that it would; it is a matter of opinion as to how far it would go. Undoubtedly it would be a significant cost factor, which must be borne in mind.<br><br>
The cost of providing pensions, as we know, is rising all the time because the number of older people in the community is growing. By the end of the decade on present estimates there will be one pensioner to every three workers. If the pension age were reduced by five years, there would be one pensioner to every two workers. It is important to remember that the first of our annual reviews takes effect from next October and it will increase the cost falling on contributors.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
I appreciate the hon. Member's view which is held by many people, not necessarily of his own party. It is a question of priorities. If the money were available, should we want to use it to reduce the pensionable age, or should we want to increase the level of benefits? It comes down to something of a choice, and many people would side with increasing benefits.<br><br>
I suppose that it could be argued that the reduction in the age which is foreseen would not compel anyone to retire against his will, but I am not sure that we could be certain of that. We do not want to condemn fit and active men and women to enforced retirement. The hon. Member cited the case of one of our brilliant former colleagues; there are many men and women, I am glad to say, in their eighties possessing all their faculties
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
and still very active, and there are certainly many men and women between 60 and 65 who still have immense potential.<br><br>
Sometimes there would be enforced retirement, and the lead given by the State would eventually be followed by some employers. That could lead to distress and unhappiness among those who receive fulfilment from their work and who are anxious to go on working and also would resist the pressures generated on them to give way. We do not want to put ourselves into that position, while recognising that we must take care of those who are prematurely aged and not fit to go on working in their later years.<br><br>
There are clearly conflicting views on the subject. We do not entirely rule out the possibilities of change in the minimum pension age some day, if social and economic circumstances were to change to such an extent as to suggest that such a move might be acceptable. But I do not see it happening in the immediate future, and while I appreciate many of the arguments, in the circumstances and for the reasons I have put forward, I must say again that the Government would not go along with the Clause. The hon. Member knows that, while the Bill will clearly go through its Committee stage now, and we shall not be opposing it as such, we cannot subscribe to its various tenets to let in go on to the Statute Book.</span></p>

<p><i>Clauses 4 to 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed</i>, That the Chairman do report the Bill, without Amendment, to the House.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The one thing we must do, whatever we may feel about the debate we have had, is to express appreciation to you, Miss Quennell, for the excellent and courteous manner in which you have presided over our deliberations this morning. You were a little confused at one stage about the identity of some of my colleagues. If it is any consolation to you, I do that every day of the week, particularly with the Davieses. But I am sure that your gracious apology helped towards the excellent feeling which we have enjoyed.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0409">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
I would also thank the Minister. I did not agree with much of what he said, but I appreciate the fact that he came along, having clearly spent some time thinking about what might happen in the debate, and very courteously gave us the Government's view, which was disappointing but of great interest, outside as well as inside the House.<br><br>
I should also like to express appreciation to my own union, APEX, and its legal advisers who helped me considerably in drafting the Bill and preparing the case, and last of all to my hon. Friends who have taken such a constructive part and also who have produced some fascinating information and arguments.<br><br>
If it is not too controversial a note on which to end, I contrast that very favourably with the complete absence of the hon. Gentlemen's hon. Friends, who clearly do not think that such matters are worth their attention. I thank you very much indeed, Miss Quennell.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely associate myself with the hon. Gentleman's remarks in thanking you, Miss Quennell, for your courtesy in presiding over our proceedings so efficiently. I, too, have enjoyed these discussions; the compulsion of taking
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
part and having to read the Second Reading debate, and of listening to the arguments today, has been worth while for me, because many of the subjects we have been discussing are of general interest, on whichever side of the House hon. Members sit. I have certainly learned a great deal, and I shall consider some of the arguments again in a wider context. I shall not pursue that, as I should be out of order.<br><br>
I should like to join the hon. Member in thanking you, Miss Quennell, and to say that I am glad that you did not need a map drawn for you to identify Members, those sitting on this side of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I omitted to mention the Clerk, who has been extremely helpful, both before we came here today and during our discussions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most obliged to both hon. Members and to all other hon. Members for their kindness and co-operation during this morning's business.</span></p>
