	<div class='page-header'><h1>NIGHT ASSEMBLIES BILL</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ray Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wallace. I have no wish to add to your difficulties as Chairman, but I wonder whether I may raise with you a problem that I encountered last week, namely, the encroachment on what is regarded as the preserve of Second Reading. May I point out that the Second Reading lasted only 55 minutes, and that many of the arguments that hon. Members may have wanted to deploy on Second Reading could not be adduced. In fact, another three minutes and the Bill would have been talked out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As this is a Bill of importance, with many very clear liberties at stake, may we have a more liberal interpretation of the rule relating to Second Reading speeches and to the manner in which we proceed in Committee? I know the difficulty that you are in, Mr. Wallace, and I have no wish—I am sure the rest of the Committee, at least on this side, has no wish—to make your life difficult, but there is a problem for us in trying to avoid invading those areas which should have been thoroughly explored on Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am appreciative of the concern expressed for my personal welfare. The blunt fact is that there has been a Second Reading debate. If it lasted for only a few minutes, that is just one of those things. There has been a Second Reading debate, and we must now stick closely to Committee procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we go any further, the Committee will remember that new Clause No. 4—which was a revised version of new Clause No. 1—was included in the group of Amendments regarding exemptions, debate on which was concluded by the closure at the last Sitting. I appreciate, however, that new Clause No. 4 was a starred Amendment last Wednesday and that there was little discussion of the revised text in the debate. In these circumstances, I am prepared to select new Clause No. 4 for what, I hope, will be a short debate on the terms of the new
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
Clause itself, and accordingly have placed it again among the selected Amendments. A revised list of my provisional selection of Amendments is on the table.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wallace. I appreciate that the Official Reporters have been very hard pressed in the course of the last few weeks, but there is a rather important error, for me, in column 75, line 4, at the last Sitting of the Committee, where I am reported as having said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… my Bill is aimed at pop festivals."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee C,</i> 15th March, 1972; 	<i>c.</i> 75.]</p></blockquote>
I took this matter up with the OFFICIAL REPORTERS and they agree that, in fact, I said "does not contain the words 'pop festivals'". Could that fact be recorded?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that the point will be noted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this Amendment it may be convenient to take the following:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the close of our Sitting last week the Committee will recall that I was on my feet and that we were in the process of starting the real debate on the question of numbers. I should indicate straight away that I will give way in a few moments to any hon. Gentle-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0171">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
man who wishes to intervene on the basis of our rather quick exchange last week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also, Mr. Wallace, I note that you have selected my new Clause No. 6 to be debated with these existing matters. That is, I am sure, entirely satisfactory. New Clause No. 6 is purely a probing new Clause and, according to the replies we receive, it is not likely, as I foresee it at the moment, that I should wish to put this to a vote, but it depends on how the debate goes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 3, to leave out "one" and insert "fifteen", is a probing Amendment which was put down before we had the knowledge that the promoter of the Bill, the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin), was going to put down an Amendment dealing with the numbers who could attend an assembly without falling within the provisions of Clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his opening remarks the hon. Member gave no indication whatsoever of the criteria upon which he was basing his preference to move from 1,000 as set out in the Clause to 3,000 as set out in his Amendment. I feel that the Committee must expect him—indeed, the hon. Gentleman has a responsibility to do so—to spell out to us on what criteria he has arrived at that particular number.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In last week's Sitting, when the hon. Member was putting forward his Amendment, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That figure was selected since it was clear that there were certain assemblies of 1,100 or 1,200 people which had taken place and which had attracted criticism, particularly on safety grounds."</p></blockquote>
I indicated in the few remarks when I had the floor last week that, in fact, at pop festivals and night assemblies of that nature which have so far been held and which were within our knowledge, not many of them had been as low as that number. The hon. Member then went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Hon. Gentlemen will, no doubt, press me to extend the figures even further, but if we do that we shall start moving into areas where assemblies become dangerous to those who attend."—[OFFICAIL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee C,</i> 15th March, 1972; 	<i>c.</i> 95.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman has, therefore, made two claims to support his contention of 3,000. Both of those claims, when we come to examine them, as I hope we shall do today, are quite groundless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, if the hon. Gentleman is claim-
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
ing that assemblies of 1,100 to 1,200 in the past have been criticised, particularly on safety grounds, he must spell out the details to the Committee. He cannot expect us to accept a wide, sweeping statement of that nature without being given chapter and verse and the place where the assemblies to which he refers were held, and on what grounds they have been criticised in respect of public safety, so that we can see whether or not that claim is right. I hope the hon. Member will do that. When he comes to his later statement which I have quoted from column 95, the situation becomes even more serious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked for a reference on this question of the smaller festivals, and I refer him to the Second Reading debate, in column 920. At the end of that column I quoted at some length a letter from the Clerk of the Truro Rural District Council, and I think that will give him the information he requires.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was aware of what was said in column 920 of the Report of the Second Reading debate, and I recall that the hon. Member had given that example. I did not believe that that reference, together with the Shepton Mallet Rural District Council example, was really sufficient justification for that wide, sweeping statement and claim that he has made in the Committee, that there has been serious and widespread criticism, or that if we raised the numbers above 3,000 we would be moving into an area which would become dangerous to those who attend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The facts are as I will give them to the Committee in a few moments. But first of all, I think I ought to say, in absolute rebuttal of the hon. Member's claim, that the 	<i>British Medical Journal</i> of 23rd January, 1971 carried a report by two members of the St. John Ambulance Brigade, and I shall quote from page 219. The two gentlemen in question are beyond reproach in their dedication to the public good and are highly qualified in the matters on which they report. Mr. L. K. Levens is the Area Surgeon of the St. John Ambulance Brigade for Newcastle-under-Lyme, and Mr. J. Durham is the Divisional Superintendent. They attended a festival called the Hollywood Festival of Music held at Madderley near Stoke-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
on-Trent in May, 1970. That was an assembly of some 40,000 people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report said this:
	<br><blockquote><p>"All the doctors on the site were misled by reports of drug-taking, orgy-making hippies, and it was soon realised that many young people who looked as though they had taken stimulants were in fact ordinary, excited, and rather tired—and in some cases hungry."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that it was encouraging that at that festival there were many doctors on the site, because at the festivals in the Shepton Mallet R.D.C. there were nothing like enough doctors? It is hoped that insistence be placed on a required number for the numbers who will attend. It is one of the points of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To a degree, I can go along with the hon. Member and say that we hope that at the end of our debates in Committee it will be established that there is a need for a reasonable code of practice and that that code of practice will lay down a requirement for the promoters to provide proper and adequate medical attention at the sites. I am not in dispute with the hon. Member on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I dispute are the wide sweeping claims made by his hon. Friend without producing any substantial evidence to support them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I continue to quote from the document I have mentioned. These two St. John Ambulance people go on to say:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"This group of 35,000—40,000 had a natural dignity, grace, and happiness that is difficult to credit (from adverse reports) unless it is seen."</p></blockquote>
What I am saying to the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare is that he has not yet produced any real evidence to substantiate his wide claims. We have before the Committee the views of two well qualified people who have attended a very large festival of 40,000 people and who were satisfied that the youngsters attending that were not in any danger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They go on in the report to give a detailed breakdown of the number of people subject to injury. They say that of the 40,000 people who attended there were only 493 people treated by the medical practitioners on the site. They say that that figure of 493 was only 1.25 per cent. of those attending. The biggest number who came were first of all some 228 suffering from headaches and 108
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
suffering from burns—mostly sunburn and not burns from fire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is obvious that the hon. Member has no evidence at all when he makes his wild accusation that if we move above 3,000 we shall be moving into the area where danger would exist at an assembly. In fact, as I have shown, an assembly far in excess of 3,000 was conducted properly, had proper medical attention, and the injuries reported show that the dangers which the hon. Member foresees, did not occur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for giving way. Is he aware that the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mr. Golding) lives immediately opposite the site on which the festival to which my hon. Friend refers took place, and that prior to that festival he was bitterly opposed to that event taking place, expressing many of the fears that are coming from the sponsor of the Bill and from others on the opposite side of the Committee? Is he not also aware that after that event had taken place the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme admitted that all his original fears were without foundation, and he expressed a considerable degree of happiness with the way in which that festival had been conducted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Maddan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to interrupt the hon. Member with facts and figures and contentions, except to say that if I catch your eye, Mr. Wallace, I can give very good reasons for supporting my hon. Friends. With reference to the Stoke festival, for example—I do not intend to speak on it now, in an intervention—I want him to know that there are arguments in favour of the position taken by my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to know that, and that is why we put down our probing Amendment. There is a necessity for the facts to be brought out very clearly in Committee before we come to any hasty decisions which affect freedoms and rights of assembly, and I look forward with interest to the hon. Member's contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0173">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
Carter) for raising his point. I was aware of the close proximity of the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme to the site at Madderley where the assembly was held in May, 1970, and I am also aware that my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lvme spoke on the debates on the Isle of Wight Bill. I will not bore the Committee on trespass on your tolerance, Mr. Wallace, by quoting from my hon. Friend's speech in the Isle of Wight Bill debates, but he made clear during the course of the debates on the Floor of the House the facts which my hon. Friend has now laid before the Committee, and the fears which have been expressed were eradicated with the impact of experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will recall, Mr. Wallace, as will the Committee, that at the last Sitting there was some disagreement on what some people might consider matters of fact, when I made a certain statement. I feel that I am in duty bound to abide by the offer and the promise that I gave then that I would give way later in the course of the debate. I think it would put it in the right setting if I were to quote the words which I used, reported in c. 97, and it will give any hon. Member the opportunity to challenge if he wishes to do so. I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is beyond question that it has become clear that, with Government backing and full support, this is an outright attack upon pop festivals and young people."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee C,</i> 15th March, 1972, 	<i>c.</i> 97.]</p></blockquote>
The Minister wished to intervene; he called out, "Disgraceful" and said that I would not give way because I was afraid to do so. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to intervene at this stage, I shall be more than happy to give way to him in order that he can put forward any points. But obviously the Minister does not want to do so and, therefore, the charge sticks. Also the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Crouch)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to interrupt the flow of the speech of the hon. Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved). The hon. Member knows why I interrupted him. He was going on record with a completely false statement at one minute to One o'clock and letting it remain there for a week before he developed his argument.
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
He is now developing his argument and I shall answer it in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the Minister has now seized the opportunity of saying that that was a deliberately false argument, and I want to relate my rebuttal of his claim to the Amendments. The rebuttal is quite simple. The Clause to which the Amendments relate sets out what we believe, and what the majority of people in the country who have studied these matters believe, to be a direct attack, a direct affront to certain basic civil liberties, and the Amendments in the name of the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare establish that my charge is beyond dispute. Yet hon. Members in the Committee who support the Bill still hesitate to come out clearly with the real intention behind the Clause and behind their Amendments, which is to stop pop festvals and to restrict young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the Committee to c. 73 of the Second Sitting of the Committee—we were then dealing with certain exemptions—where the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare is reported as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The hon. Gentleman will follow that it would be perfectly easy to say that a pop festival was a recreational activity, and the effect of passing Amendment No. 46 would, I believe, be to destroy the Bill totally. I am sure that that was not his intention."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare said that if we exempted the Caravan Club and the Camping Club—because that is what Amendment No. 46 related to—it would completely destroy the purpose of the Bill as that Amendment was drafted. I intervened to ask if an organisation which had exemption from the burdens of the Bill was therefore a reputable organisation, and if it decided to hold a pop festival of over 3,000 in acordance with the hon. Member's Amendment, whether the hon. Member considered that to be all right, and he replied.
	<br><blockquote><p>"No. I think it unlikely that the Caravan Club, the Camping Club, the Boy Scouts or the Girl Guides will wish to hold the sort of festivals we are talking about. Were they to do so, I think it fair to say that the exemption under new Clause No. 4 could be withdrawn by the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State of the day would be entitled to withdraw the exemption."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee C,</i> 15th March, 1972; 	<i>cc.</i> 73–4.]</p></blockquote>
I submit that it is clear from that exchange that while Government Members
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0174">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
have been trying to cloak their attack on pop festivals and young people in making the Bill much wider, they have now, by their Amendments, tried, to some degree, to retract what was an attack on civil liberties. It is becoming clearer, and became clear in that exchange, that this is fast becoming what it was originally intended to be when conceived in their minds—a direct and deliberate attack on pop festivals and on young people. One only needs to look at the statement by the Minister to know that that attack on pop festivals and young people has the full support of Her Majesty's Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has failed, despite my clear explanation, to grasp my point on Amendment No. 46, by which he hoped to link the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960 with this Bill. That Act quite clearly refers to recreational purposes, and I was trying to put that over to him in a clear manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee is reverting to a previous debate, and it is out of order. We are discussing, for the clarification of the Committee, the number which should attend, the hours of the event and what constitutes the open air. I should be grateful if the Committee would keep to the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Mr. Wallace, that is the precise point I am endeavouring to put to the Committee, that the hon. Member's Amendment to leave out "1,000" and substitute "3,000" as the numbers who could attend without falling within the ambit of the Clause's restrictive, repressive implications, has a direct bearing upon the activities of the Camping and Caravanning Club. This is why I used last week's exchange as an illustration to substantiate the charge that the Bill, whether it has 1,000 or 3,000 incorporated in the Clause, is designed to stop pop festivals and is an anti-young Measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend leaves that point, may I put it to him that this Bill is based on the Isle of Wight Bill. It has been made abundantly clear by the sponsor. In the Isle of Wight Bill it was made incumbent on local authorities to lay down conditions, one of which would be about numbers attending pop festivals on the Isle of Wight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member aware that every application to the Isle of Wight authorities has been turned down so far and, even worse than that, there has been no conditions drawn up by the Isle of Wight and published yet? No numbers have been specified at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodnutt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite untrue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give way to the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Woodnutt) in a moment. I am very much aware of the situation relating to the Isle of Wight in 1970. I am not absolutely certain that my hon. Friend is correct in respect of Section 6 of the Isle of Wight Act, 1970, which required that authority to publish a code of model terms and conditions relating to the control of night assemblies in the open, published by the Isle of Wight. Whether they are freely available is a matter which I cannot speak upon, but the fact that they are at least in being I can vouch for, because the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight was kind enough to supply me with a copy. If he wishes to clarify anything I will give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodnutt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman. The model clauses and conditions were published within three months of the Act coming on to the Statute Book. The hon. Gentleman has said that I sent him a copy. They are available in all the public libraries in the island. They are available to anyone who writes in for them, and anyone who applies to have a pop festival is immediately sent a set. The hon. Member should not make these wild assertions without making certain of his facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point I should like to make is that the model conditions say nothing whatever about numbers. The number, which is 5,000, is stipulated clearly in Section 5 of the Isle of Wight Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter) will be able to justify his statement if he is successful in catching your eye later in the debate, Mr. Wallace. It is not for me at this stage to enter into any great defence on his behalf, because my hon. Friend needs no great defence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was about to turn to a more detailed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0175">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
examination of the numbers. I am well aware that under Section 5(11) of the Isle of Wight Act, the Isle of Wight authority obtained powers to limit the application of Section 5 of their Act to assemblies of 5,000 or more. One is fully aware of that. We did not seize the opportunity during the passage of the Isle of Wight Act fully to explore the criteria on which they had chosen 5,000, and because of that error and omission it is even more important that on this occasion we should explore the situation so that we do not fall into the same error. One of the questions that the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) must answer is why he feels that he needs a lower figure here than the Isle of Wight thought necessary in its Bill. What is the basis of his calculation? The only measure now on the Statute Book dealing with assemblies of this nature is the Isle of Wight Act, 1971, in which the figure is 5,000. What reasons led the hon. Gentleman to depart from that figure? Perhaps he will tell us. We are entitled to know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am informed by sources experienced in these matters that over the past few years approximately 45 assemblies concerning pop music have been recorded. So far as the facts can be established, attendances at 15 of those assemblies ranged from 100,000 to 150,000. There were about 30 smaller assemblies where attendances ranged from 5,000 to 50,000. There is no evidence at all of pop festivals being held for very small numbers, below the 1,000 or 3,000 mark. Yet the hon. Gentleman still denies that the Bill is designed to stop young people enjoying themselves at pop festivals. He must give us facts to justify his claims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How many of the 45 pop festivals recorded as having taken place were successful? How many of them incurred public disapproval because they conformed with the hon. Gentleman's allegation that they were a danger to public health and public safety, and a nuisance to those living nearby? The hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends have produced no evidence at all to substantiate their allegations. In Measures such as this, which are fundamental to the freedom and the rights of assembly of law-abiding citizens, the burden of proof must be upon
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
the promoters. The promoters have so far not substantiated their claims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to turn to the three festivals held on the Isle of Wight in particular. We are fortunate to have as a member of the Committee the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Woodnutt). We can therefore study in some depth and with some degree of accuracy the circumstances of those three festivals and the numbers involved to see whether there is any evidence there which in any way supports the allegations of the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first of those three festivals on the Isle of Wight was held in 1968 at Gods-hill. The second was held at Wootton in 1969 and the third at Freshwater in 1970. The hon. Member for the Isle of Wight spoke in debates on the Isle of Wight Act, 1971. We now have the benefit of papers read at the Congress of the Royal Institute of Public Health in 1971. Mr. Baines, the present clerk to the Isle of Wight County Council, gave a paper, as indeed did Mr. Quantrill, medical officer of health for the rural district council in whose area at least one of the festivals was held. We also now have the testimony of Mr. R. J. Nicholls, the public health inspector for a rural district council on the Isle of Wight where those festivals have been held.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They say that there has been gross exaggeration in respect of the numbers who attended. Mr. Quantrill in his paper, which is recorded in page 130 of the Reports of the Congress, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Oddly enough, it is not only impossible to obtain a reliable estimate of the expected attendances at such events, but it is also impossible to discover, with any reasonable accuracy, the size of the audience during the actual entertainment! Any figures given with regard to numbers involved must, therefore, be regarded as rough estimates only."</p></blockquote>
We have the estimates of those three gentlemen recorded in the Reports of the Congress. Mr. Baines says that at the Godshill 1968 festival there were between 7,000 and 16,000 people present; Mr. Quantrill and Mr. Nicholls say that there were only 7,000 present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not aware, and the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight will, I am sure, give the evidence to the Committee if evidence indeed exists, that there was any serious threat to public order; that there were large numbers of people taken to hospital suffering from diseases or injuries arising from the large numbers of people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0176">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
at that 1968 festival. In none of the reports of the three officers who were most concerned with the running of those festivals from a local authority point of view is there any suggestion that that was the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 1969 festival the situation was not so good, and there were difficulties. No-one would wish to minimise those difficulties. The numbers far exceeded the promoters' estimate. The food supplies were inadequate, as were the sanitation facilities for the numbers who attended, and it would be fair to say that many thousands of young people who attended the 1969 festival had very sound reasons for complaint. It seems that they were taken for a ride by the promoters, and I join with every member of the Committee who seeks to make it impossible for unscrupulous commercial interests, either by inexperienced folly or pure downright robbery, in saying that it is our duty to ensure that in future that will not be the case. But I do not believe that we are doing it in the right way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodnutt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very pleased to hear the hon. Gentleman make those last remarks about being with us in wishing to protect young people from dishonest and unscrupulous promoters. But, that being his view, why does he keep saying that the Bill is aimed at young people and is to stop pop festivals, when we made it clear that we are on the side of them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very legitimate point, and I will answer it straight away. With my hon. Friends, I am determined that there should be a severe limitatoin put upon commercial exploitation of a nature which is unacceptable to decent society. In that sense I am at one with the hon. Gentleman. He will recall that at our first and second Sittings there were Amendments to relieve from the burden of the Bill those enterprises—pop festivals—run on a non-commercial basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are dealing purely with numbers, not with other interests coming in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your point, Mr. Wallace, but the hon. Gentleman intervened and made the point. I am only seeking a few moments to reply to it. The hon. Gentleman recalled how his vote and the votes of his side went on the question of making the Bill not applicable to noncommercial activities. The hon. Gentle-
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
man should examine things more carefully before making interjections, because it was he, with his vote on a previous occasion, who defended the commercial interests, and not my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In deference to your request, Mr. Wallace, I return to the question of numbers. I have shown that it is impossible to have really reliable estimates. Certainly, the estimates in the national Press of vast numbers, of a quarter of a million or so, have not been borne out by those who were on the spot in the Isle of Wight and whose duty to their local authority it was to try to make some reasonable estimate. Three people have made their estimates: they are much lower than those to which the popular Press has given currency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because I do not wish to trespass on your goodwill, Mr. Wallace, nor upon the time of the Committee, I have dealt very briefly with some of the difficulties and disasters which occurred at the 1969 festival. The hon. Member for the Isle of Wight will agree that, at the Freshwater festival of 1970, there was a vast improvement in standards. Although there was an increased attendance, the difficulties which had occurred a year previously did not, by and large, recur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why was that? The attendance was far in excess of the 3,000 to which the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare seeks to restrict them. Reliable estimates are that more than 150,000 attended. Yet, again praying in aid those three gentlemen—the clerk to the county council, the public health inspector and the medical officer of health—there was a vast improvement. There were no substantial difficulties, because the Isle of Wight County Council, without the aid of law—the 1971 Isle of Wight Measure was not then on the Statute Book—had managed to arrive at a voluntary but none the less legal agreement with the promoters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodnutt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very great difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are always difficulties in arriving at legal agreements on complicated matters. If that were not so, many of my hon. Friends and many hon. Members opposite would be leading very poverty-stricken lives, bereft of their vast legal fees. The hon. Gentleman, before he became a Minister in the present Government, would also have been in some difficulty if legal agreements were so easy that laymen could enter into them at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0177">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
the drop of a hat. I am not criticising my hon. Friends, nor, indeed, the profession in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have shown that only a very small number of the assemblies for pop festival purposes so far held have caused real concern. The vast majority, involving numbers far in excess of the 3,000—or, indeed, the 15,000 referred to in my probing Amendment; and I emphasise that it is no more than a probing Amendment—have been held successfully, without danger to public health and to the satisfaction of the community at large.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister, who obviously intends to intervene, do the Committee the honour of replying to a point put previously by my hon. Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson)? It concerns an article in the 	<i>Spectator</i> of 11th March, 1972, about the report of a committee set up by the Secretary of State for the Environment to inquire into the role of youth and voluntary movements in the environment. There has been a leak, I assume, because the 	<i>Spectator</i> carries what are alleged to be extracts from that report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A leak?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume that it is a leak, because the report has not been published. I think that we are entitled to ask the Minister to state categorically whether that report contains any reference to numbers. Does that report, from a committee set up by the Minister, require a limit of 3,000, as suggested by his hon. Friend who is promoting the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must not skate away under the cloak of secrecy by saying that this is a report to his Minister which he is not at liberty to disclose. The Clause and the Amendments affect the liberties of a large number of people. On a Bill of such a serious nature the Minister must spell out very clearly the best information on numbers that is available to the Government. I hazard a guess that there is nothing in that report which would give aid and comfort to the restrictive desires of the hon. Gentleman to exempt from the impact of the Bill assemblies as small as 3,000. Let us hope that the Minister will come clean on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the effect of the Amendment on the Camping Club and the Caravan
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
Club. The hon. Gentleman has claimed that the Amendment would exempt such organisations from the burden of the Bill, because, in his words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… I exempt almost all the functions of organisations such as the Caravan Club and the Camping Club … first, by the fact that only one or two of their very largest gatherings will come within the compass of the Bill."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee C,</i> 15th March, 1972; 	<i>c.</i> 72.]</p></blockquote>
He was referring to his Amendment, which was then not before us, which, by the insertion of the word "three", makes the number 3,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made inquiries, and I am advised that the hon. Gentleman's claim that his Amendment would exempt all but one or two of the functions of the Camping Club of Great Britain is not correct. The Committee should take this aboard. I am advised that at least eight regional meets of the Camping Club are held each year. The hon. Member laughs—indeed, snorts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did nothing of the sort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give way to the hon. Gentleman so that he may clarify his facial expressions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may well have indicated that the word "few" could well apply to eight instead of to four. The hon. Member is indulging in semantics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will quote again, for the hon. Gentleman's benefit, his own words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… first, by the fact that only one or two of their very largest gatherings will come within the compass of the Bill …"</p></blockquote>
This is the allegation that the hon. Gentleman makes in support of his Amendment to raise the limit from 1,000 to 3,000. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take my point seriously. I do not wish to have a personal dispute with him because, like him, I seek a reasonable way of dealing with some of the difficulties that we all know exist. I hope that he will take aboard the fact that eight of the regional meets of the Camping Club of Great Britain will not fall within the exemptions that he claims for them, nor will that rally, which so many of my fellow members of the Camping Club indulge in, the Tulip Rally, be exempt; nor will the Nottingham Goose Fair, another great annual event attended by more than 3,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
If the Camping Club, in pursuance of its endeavours to improve international relations and the understanding between people—especially the young—of different nations, holds an international rally within the confines of the area covered by the Bill, that rally, too, would not be covered. The Feast of Lanterns, which is often attended by many thousands of people, would not be covered. Clearly, that is one of the two events to which the hon. Gentleman was referring in c. 72 of the OFFICIAL REPORT of 15th March.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I referred to the Caravan Club and the Camping Club because the hon. Gentleman had earlier drawn attention to many other organisations. He will know that new Clause No. 4, which we discussed last week, exempts the Caravan Club and the Camping Club anyhow, but my point is that we have here a double-barrelled security. We have tried to meet the hon. Gentleman, but he does not appear to appreciate it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The allegation that new Clause No. 4 exempts still has to be tested by debate in the Committee, so I shall not trespass on the Committee's time by dealing with it now. However, the hon. Gentleman's contentions in support of the Amendment are not borne out by the advice given to me by the organisations most intimately concerned, which know the facts as the hon. Gentleman plainly does not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot speak on behalf of the Caravan Club because I have not been able to take advice from it, but my experience in these matters leads me to believe that it might be placed on a similar basis to the Camping Club of Great Britain, because I know that it runs very similar functions and has in some respects a similar regional organisation and a need for regional meetings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment does not, as the probing Amendment No. 3 sought to do, cover most of the activities of the Camping and the Caravan Clubs. I hope, that the hon. Gentleman will, if he is, as I believe, serious in wishing to exempt 	<i>bona fide</i> organisations from the burden of the Bill in honour of the Minister's pledge on Second Reading, take aboard my points and bear in mind that my figure of 15,000 is more likely to meet the interests in question. If he will give us an indication that, on Report, he will attempt
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
to deal with the matter, that would go a long way to help the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman in his intervention referred to the fact that I had previously prayed in aid a number of bodies other than the Camping and the Caravan Clubs. He is quite right. I mentioned a number of religious bodies. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will pay some attention to the debate, particularly when it touches a matter upon which he has intervened, though it may be an indication of his attitude to the question that he pays so little attention to important points relating to an Amendment standing in his name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have now had the benefit of correspondence with a number of religious organisations. The Baptist Renewal Group has written to me, saying,
	<br><blockquote><p>"If, as one may assume, it is aimed at certain abuses and dangers then it would be wiser to name what they are and restrict the Bill to them. Otherwise in the hands of less scrupulous persons the Bill could so easily become a cause of offence to Christians who do not lightly give up freedom to assemble because they know at what cost it was gained by their forefathers."</p></blockquote>
That is a not unfair quotation from the letter, because the Group has assemblies—all-night prayer vigils—which would involve numbers in excess of the 3,000 specified in the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member knows full well, because I have consulted him, that I have tabled an Amendment to cover religious organisations. Whilst it is true that we are at present discussing numbers, he is raising point after point that already dealt with by me in Amendments. I have done my best to give way to him on these matters, and I am not, apparently, being helped at all by him as a result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difficulty we face, Mr. Wallace, is that under the rules of order we are allowed to debate only the matters which are put to us from the Chair, and those are the Amendments which are within your selection. It may well be that the hon. Gentleman the Member for Weston-super-Mare is easing and trying to redeem himself from the evils of the Bill as he presented it by trying to table a number of Amendments. I do not dispute that, but we cannot discuss numbers on the assumption that at some later stage we may or may not agree to an Amendment put down in haste last
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>117</span>
night by the hon. Gentleman. It therefore does not lie within him to make the accusation that I am in any way being unfair. I have directed my remarks to the Clause as drafted and to the Amendments at present before us, and do not think that the hon. Gentleman is being fair either to me or to the Committee in making that statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it not have been much more helpful to the Committee and to those of us who want to take part in this debate if the hon. Gentleman had tabled this Amendment in time for the debate about exemptions? The hon. Gentleman well knew that there were serious doubts on this side, raised very early on, about the impact the Bill would have on trade unions and charitable organisations, and he has been particularly dilatory in dealing with this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member replies to the point, which I will allow him to do, I must point out that we have dealt with exemptions. We cannot introduce the question of exemptions into this debate, and we cannot anticipate the Amendment put down by the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your ruling entirely, Mr. Wallace. As always, your wise guidance to the Committee is absolutely right, and I completely accept what you have said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not weary the Committee by reading extracts from the many other letters from religious bodies, including the Church Missionary Society, that I have, all of which express the most serious reservations and, I believe, will continue to express those reservations even if the hon. Gentleman's Amendment to make the number 3,000 were to be accepted by the Committee. It would affect many of their outside activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is all I want to say at this stage on Amendments Nos. 48, 3 and 4, which refer to numbers. I turn now to some of the other matters which are before the Committee and in particular to my new Clause No. 6 which has been selected for discussion with this batch of Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My new Clause sets out to introduce into the Bill an interpretation Clause in
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
an endeavour to define what "in the open air" means. My Clause reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In this Act 'in the open air' shall mean total exposure to the weather in an atmosphere unconfined by any form of cover."</p></blockquote>
I confess that, not being legally primed, I may not have framed my Clause in the most tasteful and best legal language, so I say at once that it is put forward in an exploratory spirit. I shall be happy to withdraw it if the Committee can be satisfied that this point can be more adequately covered by different wording, and for that wording to be presented on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My intention in the new Clause is to ensure that those people who conduct themselves in an acceptable way and have so conducted themselves for many years will come completely within the cloak of the Minister's pledge on Second Reading and will be exempt from the burden of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a definition Clause were included defining "in the open air" along the lines I have indicated, it would have the following effect, I hope. First, those who were within a tent for at least part of the eight hours to which Amendment No. 49 relates would be exempt from the burden of the Bill, because they would not be totally exposed to the weather and without cover. People spending part of the night in a caravan would also be exempt because they too, under my definition, would not be in the open air and totally exposed to the weather in an atmosphere unconfined by any form of cover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If by adopting new Clause No. 6 or some more acceptably worded Clause, we could arrive at that definition, it would completely honour the pledge given by the Minister that the Bill would in no way affect those organisations which at the moment have the benefit of exemption under another Act, and which he agrees ought to be exempt from the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The implication of the new Clause in regard to assemblies—religious or, better still, assemblies where music is played in the open at night—is that if the promoters supplied marquees sufficient in number and size for those attending the festival to spend some of the eight hours referred to in Amendment No. 49 they, too, would be exempt from the provisions of the Measure, That would be desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0180">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
If the promoters of a pop festival wished to provide amenities and facilities of such a standard that the young people attending could spend a few hours at rest in a marquee, and could take shelter in a marquee if the weather proved inclement, they would be providing such a standard of facilities and in such a reasonable manner that they ought to be exempt, particularly if we are to accept the claims of hon. Members opposite that the Bill is not designed to attack young people and to stop pop festivals. The new Clause would lay the foundation of standards which, if achieved by promoters, ought to give them exemption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodnutt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman refers to the promoters providing cover, but the new Clause does not say that. As I understand it, if all the fans who came to a pop festival brought with them some kind of tent or covering, even a sleeping-bag, as they used to do, a pop festival attended by 150,000 people would also be exempt. Is that assumption correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whilst I support my hon. Friend's intention here, does he not agree that the promoters—religious or otherwise—need not go to the trouble of providing marquees? They need only say to those attending, "Please bring your own umbrellas".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may or may not be the case. I am not a lawyer. I put forward the new Clause in order to provoke discussion to see how far we can go in eliminating some of the threats to civil liberties which would be involved if the hon. Gentleman's Amendments to Clause 1 were carried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for the Isle of Wight and my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) have raised an important point. If the promoters of an assembly so laid out their ground, and the ground were of sufficient size that sites of reasonable size could be provided upon which those attending could erect their own tents, I submit that they are no longer in the open air. In saying that, I am mindful of the several dozen—I put it no higher than that—large assemblies which I have attended where people have been living in tents; some small tents for one or two persons and some very large tents for over a dozen persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My Amendment means that if I
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
attended an assembly with my present equipment I should be exempt, because I have a tent which is capable of holding the best part of 12 people. In the happy event of my Clause being accepted, I should be delighted to attend a festival, and invite the hon.

My hon. Friend the Member for North-field has put forward some more ingenious ideas with regard to what would or would not constitute being in the open air. I do not now intend to develop those points. I just intervene in my own speech to make this observation. If I overheard correctly, there is some concern on the benches opposite that I am speaking for a rather long time and perhaps ought not to be. I can only say to hon. Members opposite, if they can drag themselves away from their private conversations once again, that when one is dealing with such a wide range of Amendments and a new Clause grouped together, it is not unusual to examine them in some detail. Perhaps I can relieve their minds a little by indicating that at this stage I have no intention of dealing at any length with Amendment No. 59 in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Northfield, because I am sure that the Committee will wish to hear his remarks before any debate takes place on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Clause 6, as I have indicated, would not only exempt those organisations about which I am particularly concerned but would also furnish promoters with the opportunity to provide facilities, either in the form of marquees or of an area of land with ancillary facilities sufficient for people to provide their own tents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0181">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
The new Clause is a serious contribution to the debate of the questions under consideration, since it would enable those who both organise and attend these assemblies in an orderly manner to do so without the paraphernalia of the restrictive elements contained in the hon. Gentleman's proposals. In addition, it would relieve the local authorities of considerable expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this connection, let us assume that the hon. Gentleman's suggestion of 3,000 persons is adopted, or that the Clause remains unamended so that the figure of 1,000 is retained. Presumably it would be the duty of the local authority in whose area the assembly was held to count those attending. How else would it be possible to establish whether or not the law was being observed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To the sponsor of the Bill, the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare, I say only that I think that I have shown, both in respect of Amendment No. 48 and of new Clause No. 6, that there are serious matters at issue, worthy of proper consideration. I accept that the hon. Gentleman will not be able to deal with all the points raised this morning. If, however, he can indicate his willingness to consider them with a view to their possible acceptance at a later stage, I should be willing to withdraw probing Amendment No. 3 and new Clause No. 6.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman the Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved) earlier invited me to interject. I declined to do so at that stage, but a few words at this juncture may be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment deals with numbers, and the hon. Member saw fit to read into it what he called a determined attack on young people enjoying themselves; a Government-backed outright attack upon pop festivals and young people. His remarks were utterly ridiculous, introduced for purposes of political agitation. The hon. Member must not imagine that simply because he sports a few pubic hairs on his chin he speaks totally and absolutely for the young people of this country. The present Administration, which have ensured so much for youth, through the Sports Council and the Arts Council, obviously have no such policy or intention in supporting the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Government which have only re-
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
cently announced a further £3½ million to national voluntary services, which do so much for youth, obviously have no intention of curbing young people's enjoyment of pop festivals. It is ridiculous to read such policy or intent into a definition of "assemblies" as comprising a certain number of people, particularly having regard to the Government's financing of the Central Bureau for Educational Visits and Exchanges, which deals with approximately 50,000 inquiries from young people and 70,000 group inquiries each year.

[Mr. Michael Cocks 	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been asked to comment on the working party on the role of voluntary organisations and youth in the environment. My Secretary of State has received its report, which, like all reports from working parties set up by the Department, is receiving full and careful study. The report will be published at the end of April, and it will be appreciated that I cannot at this stage inform the Committee in detail of its contents. It would not be fair to the working party, until the Secretary of State has been advised of its recommendations, to disclose piecemeal what it has said in its report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The working party was arranged by the Secretary of State to report to him before the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, which is to be held in Stockholm in June. Its terms of reference were to consult public opinion and to consider the role of voluntary movements and youth in the environment. The working party, the average age of whose members, incidentally, is under 30 years, reported to the Secretary of State last month. Its report includes a chapter on pop festivals. In addition to calling attention to the large pop festivals, which were mentioned by the hon. Member—the 15 festivals with attendances of between 100.000 and 500,000 and the 30 or 40 with attendances of up to 50,000—it also calls attention to the trend towards small local gatherings of community participation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also able to mention that in its consideration of the Bill which was printed in time for the working party to include a comment in its report, reference is not made to the figure of 1,000—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am not prepared to go further, because to quote any particular extract—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>—might prove to be extremely inconvenient to the hon. Gentleman. Until the Secretary of State has considered the recommendations of the working party I propose to proceed no further, now that I have dealt with the hon. Member's point concerning numbers. I add only that the report did not refer adversely—or at all—to the figure of 1,000 printed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely the point is that the requirements for orderly conduct of a pop festival should be appropriate to the numbers attending. It is far more important to consider the requirements appropriate even to a comparatively small gathering than to be over-concerned about numbers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we should try to find a definition of "pop festival" which takes account of the trend towards the smaller gatherings—by which I mean those under the 10,000 or 15,000 mentioned in Amendments Nos. 3 and 4—where there is community participation. I see it as one of the great elements of the pop festival that all those who attend participate, rather than, as at a concert, watching people on a platform perform. It is the participation of all present in a pop festival which needs these rules of the game or requirements. So I think that we should use a figure which takes into account this type of gathering, and should not restrict ourselves to gatherings of above 10,000 or 15,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to the remarks of my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt my hon. Friend.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was hoping that my
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
hon. Friend would fill in some of the details which he omitted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodnutt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that his hon. Friend touched on the matter only lightly because 95 per cent. of what he said was completely irrelevant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oddly enough, I do not agree with that view. I thought my hon. Friend's speech excellent, to-the-point and straightforward. What interests me is how the hon. Member arrived at the figure of 1,000, or that of 3,000 to which it has now escalated. Did he snatch 1,000 out of the air and then, because there was much criticism from the Opposition and a very hostile Press reception of his Bill, suddenly capitulate and treble the figure? Did the same lack of research precede the choice of this figure as clearly underlies the Bill as a whole? There has been a lack of care, of foresight, of consideration, of sensitivity, a total lack of research and a complete lack of concern for basic civil liberties from start to finish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the evils—if they can be so called—which the Bill is designed to prevent? What is it about pop festivals—as we are really only speaking of them—that has become such a threat to public safety? First, as I understand it, we are not concerned with law and order; that has nothing to do with the Bill. Indeed, in the Second Reading debate, the Minister of State said,
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are no provisions in the Bill concerning public order. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has consulted the chief constables and they are of the opinion that the criminal law as it stands is adequate to deal with the problems that arise. In fact, the level of crime at assemblies of this sort is quite low. The Home Secretary shares the views of the chief constables and considers that further legislation on this aspect of public order in connection with these festivals is unnecessary. All that we are dealing with in the Bill is the public health and nuisance side of these assemblies."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 21st January, 1972; Vol. 829, 	<i>c.</i> 915.]</p></blockquote>
Therefore, we can, for instance, disregard the criticisms which were levelled at the Weeley Festival, in connection with which figures of 75,000 to 125,000 have been mentioned. I believe that it is beyond dispute that the only trouble with that festival was an invasion by Hell's Angels which led to some violence. Of course, that sort of thing must be dealt with by the normal law of the land. It is not the concern of the Bill and, though there are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0183">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
ominous words about public order in later Amendments tabled by hon. Gentlemen opposite, if we are to take the Minister's word for it the Bill is not concerned with public order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that festival, attended by 75,000 to 125,000 people and accompanied by a great deal of publicity, virtually the sole criticism related to the breakdown of public order resulting from the invasion of Hell's Angels. If a festival of that sort can be conducted with practically no other major criticism in respect of public health, why on earth has the hon. Gentleman chosen a figure of 1,000, which, under pressure, he has changed to 3,000? I know of no festival—other than the Truro Festival, of which some mention was made by the hon. Gentleman, which was attended by about 1,000 people and which would not now come under the Bill—at which there has been any legitimate criticism on health grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must see pop festivals in the right perspective, and must lower the emotional atmosphere in which they are debated. In respect of the Isle of Wight Pop Festival, which received a great deal of mostly unjustified publicity, the Chief Constable of Hampshire said,
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is easy to become emotional about pop festivals. There are many among the middle-aged who condemn outright a young person with long hair and extravagant clothes and who regard such events as presenting opportunities for orgies of drugs, sex and violence. On the other hand the young people themselves look upon such festivals as opportunities for expressing their independence and for enjoying their own particular type of music, free of all restrictions."</p></blockquote>
As we know, the chief constables have said that pop festivals constitute no great problem of control of crime. I find the Chief Constable's words very appropriate. The way in which hon. Members opposite have approached the Bill has been the same throughout: they have not seen it as a Bill to deal with 3,000, 4,000 or 5,000 well-mannered, quiet and peaceful youngsters who meet for a weekend to listen to music and to enjoy themselves together. The language which they used throughout the Isle of Wight Bill and the Second Reading of this Bill, as well as in Committee was "How would you like it if 200,000 or 150,000 or a quarter of a million people"—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying to a very thin house, which is the appropriate phrase, the language used by hon. Gentlemen opposite has always been couched in terms calculated to scaremonger and create fear in local populations. They never talk in terms of 1,000 or 3,000; the language is always highly charged, and always along the lines of: "How would you like 200,000 youngsters to come to your hamlet and play havoc thereto or thereon—outnumbering the local residents by five to one?"—or words to that effect. They have said that all along. Throughout the Second Reading they were talking about 100,000 and 150,000 people—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodnutt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be correct up to a point when he said that we have been saying: "How would you like 200,000 young people—?" I have never said this. I have always made it clear that it does not matter whether it is fans or whether it is—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true. I have got records of what the hon. Gentleman said—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is talking of 200,000 people in terms of a speech about pop festivals it is quite clear that he must be talking about young people, because it is young people who go to pop festivals. And he has been striking fear in the hearts of local people and others who read his remarks—many of whom are perhaps not very well informed about what takes place at pop festivals—about 200,000 rampaging youngsters descending on some lovely, peaceful, hamlet where decent countryfolk live, and playing havoc thereto.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the yachting brigade.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the yachting brigade. It is slightly more elevated than the language used in that notorious 	<i>Daily Telegraph</i> leader which spoke about "alien hordes" and suchlike.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet, in the course of talking in terms of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0184">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
200,000 people coming, the hon. Gentleman has not put down a figure of 200,000, 100,000, 50,000, 20,000 or even 15,000—as has my hon. Friend in a probing Amendment. I put down 10,000 as a purely probing Amendment. The hon. Gentleman started off by putting down 1,000. Where did he get the figure from? Under very great pressure, he is now talking about 3,000. Does he know of any festival or event with an expected attendance of 3,000 which has proved to be a threat to the peaceful surrounding neighbourhood and constituted a threat to public safety? He knows there has been none whatsoever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman clearly was not listening during his hon. Friend's speech, since I referred to my own Second Reading speech where it specifically states that at a festival held at Truro there was grave danger on safety grounds, not to the neighbouring countryside but to the people who attended. This is one of the points of the Bill which has quite clearly escaped the hon. Gentleman's comprehension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing has escaped my comprehension. The hon. Gentleman is bringing forward, by his own admission, this massive bureaucratic Measure giving very wide powers—indeed, arbitary powers—to local authorities, and including a figure of 3,000, because of one pop festival which was badly organised. That is the truth of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could mention more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has mentioned only one, so I am bound to say that he has shown, in putting forward this figure of 1,000, which is now upped to 3,000, the same lack of care, the same lack of thought that he put into this whole appallingly and disgracefully drafted Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to know what research the hon. Gentleman has done before he arrived at this magical figure of 1,000, because if his sole concern is public health, as he says it is—and I will accept his word for it at this stage—he must tell us which festivals, other than the Truro festival, have been so offensive and dangerous for those attending it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the Glastonbury Fair, where far more than 3,000 people attended—something like 10,000—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There were 12,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman—where 12,000 people attended—did not constitute any danger to public health at all. That was a festival of 12,000—a figure which is not mentioned in the Bill. The hon. Gentleman is talking about 3,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dr. Alan Blandford, who was the local general practitioner who headed the medical team at that festival, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As far as public health is concerned the drinking water supply was adequate and food was vegetarian and was either very cheap or free and tasty and nutritious."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman and with what he said, and J have the report here in front of me, but the numbers expected at that festival were, in fact, 100,000. Those are the figures I have which the promoter suggested might come. Because the weather was exceedingly unfavourable at the time, nothing like that number came. But had anything approaching 100,000 arrived, it would have been a very serious matter, particularly with regard to water supply and toilet arrangements, which I dealt with previously. So there are great dangers, and it is no good the hon. Gentleman trying to brush over them continually.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not brushing over anything. I was reading out a straight-forward extract from a local general practitioner, and I must take his word for it. That more people were expected than actually turned up is eloquent proof of just how absurd the Bill really is. If the numbers cannot be estimated correctly, how on earth can the Bill work at all? If the estimates are so far out that an expected 100,000 turned out to be only 10,000, how can these provisions operate at all? It is patently and obviously absurd, and the hon. Gentleman himself has proved it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely the point. What would happen in reverse if a small village pop festival was being held, the type of community festival to which the Minister was referring, at the time of year when one would expect 1,000 or 2,000 to turn up, certainly no more, and, suddenly, we had weather like today's and 12,000 came? The promoter had not registered because he did not think it necessary. Would he be prosecuted? How
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0185">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>129</span>
could he have estimated that this would happen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is another example of how totally absurd the Bill is. It would be interesting to see what would happen in such circumstances. If 3,000 were expected and the local authority had approved it by some quirk, and then, as in the circumstances outlined by my hon. Friend, the weather was magnificent—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After midnight?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, after midnight. If two or three thousand turned up and hung around waiting to get in, how would these provisions work? Would those outside be prosecuted? Would the organisers be prosecuted for allowing people to wait outside, whom they had not expected to arrive? Clearly, the Bill is unworkable, and my hon. Friend is right to draw attention to that anomaly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is anticipating later Amendments. We are dealing with specific numbers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, but I felt that in fairness to the Committee I should deal with the point, because hon. Members would like it answered. But I appreciate that we shall have to go into it in detail later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was in the process of reading a report from Dr. Alan Blandford, and I think that I should finish it. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The toilet facilities consisted of slit trench latrines with scaffolding poles erected over them and divided up by means of hessian into 1,000 compartments. They were somewhat uncomfortable to sit on and not very private and there was no sex distinction. None of these conditions seemed particularly important to the consumers, however and there is no doubt that the latrines functioned extremely adequately."</p></blockquote>
Since the hon. Gentleman referred to latrines earlier, he will know that Mr. Walter Lloyd, who was the national organiser of Civil Aid and who attended that affair, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The latrines were more than adequate, two of the sites were not used at all…"</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Latrines are the subject of discussion on Clause 2. We are not on latrines at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a subject that I want to dwell on. I may be able to develop this lavatorial argument a little
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
later, perhaps on the Amendment dealing with "open air". I think that it is relevant because the reason that the figure of 3,000 has been arrived at is, presumably, that the hon. Gentleman is saying that 3,000 people assembled constitute a potential health risk. I felt it important to show how exaggerated some of the arguments and fears are of those who see in young people assembling always a health risk, whereas they never seem to see the same risk when other people assemble, possibly at agricultural shows, flower shows and so on. I might add that the toilet arrangements at some of those shows have been appalling—not that I go regularly to agricultural shows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, therefore, incumbent upon the hon. Gentleman to say why, when he is talking in terms of hordes of people descending, he now wishes to limit the free assembly of 3,000 or more people—a very low figure indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has also tried to skate out of his difficulties with regard to the words "open air" by implying, as he has with whatever else he has been challenged on, that the phrase is incapable of definition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never said that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the implication. He came up with the same excuse when we tried to pin him down about his lack of definition of "pop festival". He said that it could not be defined. Either he has not gone to the trouble, or the Department, which has very skilled draftsmen, advised him otherwise. He shows his usual complete lack of care and thought for the basic civil liberties, and drags everything else in because he has not got the ingenuity, or does not consider it worth his while, or does not wish to take the time, to come up with a concise definition of the words, "open air."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that, as I have said before and as is generally known, that the Bill is based on the Isle of Wight Measure? The same definition of "open air" is in the Isle of Wight Act, yet there is no definition in that Act. We are now being told by the other side and by the sponsor of the Bill that there is an attempt to arrive at some form of definition.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regard the Isle of Wight Act as so deplorable that I would never use it as a precedent for anything. It is a repressive, oppressive and discriminatory Measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his strictures on the hon. Gentleman, my hon. Friend perhaps inadvertently referred to those who advised the hon. Gentleman and who drafted the Bill. I am sure that my hon.

They cannot do the impossible. This starts as a bad Bill and, if it ever gets through, it will finish as a very bad Act. All we can hope for is that it might be slightly better than when it started.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has produced, with his usual ingenuity, a very interesting definition of "open air". I would be the first to say that it might not be the most elegantly phrased, or that under close legal scrutiny there could be objections to one or two of the words in it. None the less, it is an attempt, and a serious attempt. It seems to me, as it would to people attending festivals, quite absurd that if a large marquee were erected, the people huddled peacefully and quietly in that marquee, with a degree of warmth possibly on a hot night, would be taken as being in the open air. I frankly do not see why they should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The capricious manner in which the hon. Gentleman has dealt with his obligations to the Committee in trying to meet the serious objections which have been raised has been quite amazing. He simply has not attempted to come forward with any definition of open air at all. By leaving it as it is, he is positively discouraging people who organise events of this kind from erecting any kind of tent, marquee or other structure to put over the heads and the bodies of the people assembled at a pop festival. Perhaps he just does not care because all he really wants to do is to stop the thing in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my hon. Friend the Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
Widnes (Mr. Oakes) first raised this point—I think we are all grateful to him for doing so—I raised with him the question of toilet arrangements which I think are appropriately discussed under this heading. If a council sanctioned a pop festival under the provisions of the Act, and adequate or possibly even luxurious toilet facilities were provided, presumably under cover, would the people occupying the toilets at the time be classified as being in the open air or not? This is not a frivolous question. It is very important indeed. Promoters of festivals who do not observe the requirements of the Act will incur heavy penalties. They must know precisely what is or is not in the open air and whether or not they will be caught by the provisions of the Bill. It is the hon. Gentleman's duty to give some kind of definition. If he does not do so, he is showing complete indifference to those who attend pop festivals and not, as he claims, concern for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is quite obvious that the hon. Gentleman has taken no care at all in arriving at the figure of 1,000 and then 3,000. He has done no research whatever. He simply wants to stop as many assemblies of young people as he can. Otherwise, what on earth are his objections to Boy Scouts running assemblies? Why does he not exempt them? Or the National Union of Mineworkers running all-night assemblies? They do it magnificently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he is so worried about public health, is he going to come along very shortly with another Bill? Having brought in an Act making councils stop all kinds of assemblies because the land is unsuitable or the toilet facilities inadequate, or whatever, will he try to do the same for daytime assemblies? I cannot see why he should be less concerned about toilet facilities, health hazards and the like at assemblies during the day than he seems to be during the night.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall explain it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that he will. We are all waiting to hear his explanation. The fear has been expressed in the 	<i>New Law Journal,</i> an influential journal which is widely respected in the legal profession, that another Measure may be put forward, modelled on this infamous Bill, which will bring in the same regulations in respect of assemblies during the daytime. Then we shall all have had it. Not just a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0187">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>133</span>
small area of freedom will have gone as a result of the present Bill, as it will, but the whole lot will go. That is one of my greatest fears, and I think I am right to express it in this context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all waiting to hear exactly why the hon. Gentleman has clutched out of the air this particular figure of 3,000, what research he has done and what possible reasons he can have for bringing it in. Unless he justifies it in some way, we must conclude that he does not care at all about young people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscowen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson) said that he sought to lower the emotional atmosphere. I believe he did the very opposite. I believe he sought to exacerbate the conflict of interests which we all know exists between the residents of the areas where these festivals take place and those who wish to enjoy them. It is our duty to try to reduce that conflict of interests. One does not reduce it by doing nothing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disappointed that in his 70-minute oration the hon. Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved) did not convince me one bit that he was helping the chances of young people to continue enjoying themselves at these festivals. There is such a thing as freedom and there is such a thing as licence. Sooner or later, if nothing is done, there will be a tragedy. There will be an outbreak of food-poisoning. There will be a mass of flies on a very hot day when there are insufficient toilet arrangements, and so on, and we in the House of Commons shall be to blame. Then there will be an outcry to ban festivals and events of this kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is not a single person in the Committee or even outside who would not agree that pop festivals should be organised with good toilet arrangements, good drainage, good food, and so forth. Everybody agrees about that. But the hon. Gentleman is really implying that the only assemblies where the arrangements are bad are pop festivals. We are saying that there is nothing in the Bill laying down how this should be done at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee is not dealing with Clause 2 at the moment. I must ask hon. Members to return to Clause 1 and the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscowen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to return to the question of numbers, which is central to the Amendment. Hon. Members opposite are continually saying that we do not justify these numbers at all. Any promoter of these festivals, be they large or small, has to think very hard, before he puts them on, about the facilities required for the kind of attendance he expects. Those facilities are bound to cost money. One cannot do it for nothing. It is right to bring home to promoters the minimum proper public health and site requirements for the kind of festival they wish to put on. The aim of the Bill is to bring home to the promoter that he must spend that money before he puts on the festival. Otherwise the kind of chaos will ensue which could lead to a tragedy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituency has had some experience of these festivals. We had attendances of about 150,000, 2,500 and 12,000, so we had a wide spread of experience in this connection. It is impossible for a promoter to be sure how many people will attend. Whitsun may be sunny one year and rainy the next. It also depends on the popularity of the groups employed, the amount the promoter is prepared to spend on importing overseas pop groups, and so on. There are so many incalculables that the question of numbers is very difficult indeed. Nobody really knows what is the correct figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, we ought to bring home to people promoting festivals for quite a small number that basic facilities are required. If we do not bring it home to them in a law which can be enforced, human nature being what it is, they simply will not provide them. The promoter of the festival in Shepton Mallet set out with the best will in the world to put on a very good show, but in my view he did not really understand what he was taking on. He did not provide sufficient facilities. Nor did he provide them nearly soon enough. It was only through goading and pressure by the local public health authorities that the facilities were not much worse than they were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not seeking to bring in repressive legislation against these festivals. Far from it. We are trying to introduce a minimum standard requiring the promoter to expend a certain amount of money to ensure adequate standards so
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0188">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>135</span>
that the festival will be not a health hazard but a success and a source of enjoyment for the people who go there, and also will not exacerbate the conflict of interests between them and people living in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will always be people calling for a total ban. A constituent of mine in the village of Pilton who was very close to the last two festivals there wrote to me saying that the first, with an attendance of about 2,500, was pleasant and charming when they went there, possibly because it was so small. She said that this year's festival, the one attended by 12,000, was utterly different. She goes on to talk about the lack of preparation, the noise and the ill behaviour. I do not take her views about the ill behaviour as necessarily correct, since there was very little ill behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nonetheless, the preparations for that festival were inadequate by any standard. Had the conditions been right or wrong depending on how one looks at it, there could have been an outbreak of some disease, diarrhoea or poisoning which might have been very unfortunate for a large number of people. These are dangers and they are bound to provoke strong feelings among people living nearby. They may have lived there for a very long time. Some of them are elderly or retired and do not understand what is going on and how young people like to enjoy themselves in such large numbers in this new way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore urge hon. Members opposite to think hard before condemning outright all the principles of the Bill as being oppressive or designed to attack young people's enjoyment and so on. That is simply not the case. By doing nothing, they are the ones—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman please come back to numbers? He is straying a little.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscowen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By allowing no limit to numbers attending these festivals, they are the ones who are harming the chances of festivals continuing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether 1,000, 3,000 or 250,000 are attending the festival, I am at one with the hon. Gentleman, as I believe are my colleagues, in saying that there must be proper facilities and a proper code of conduct to protect public health and indeed those who attend the festivals. I do not see the relevance of
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
numbers to that particular requirement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscowen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to have that understanding from the hon. Gentleman. It might have helped us more if it had come earlier. It was not at all clear when we were trying to produce a sensible compromise between the rights of those living in the area and the rights of those wishing to come from outside to enjoy themselves there and hon. Members were attacking this all the time as a repressive Measure aimed at young people. It would have been more helpful if we could have had that expression earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to arrive at the correct figure. It is important to bring home to people that even for a relatively small number such as 3,000 people sensible precautions and preparations are essential. If the figure is higher, it may encourage people to think that they can hold festivals without proper preparations or think they can do so without running into large money losses. That is another aspect of this. The size of the festival reflects upon whether the promoter is going to make or lose money. The promoter who arranged a festival in my constituency attended by 2,500 people definitely lost a lot of money because not enough people were coming in through the gate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that 3,000 is about right, give or take a little perhaps. It does not exclude certain bodies which have been mentioned. It does ensure that 	<i>bona fide</i> promoters who want to put on a good show take the proper precautions to find out what is needed, to prepare the ground and to make it known to local people that their interests are being taken into consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it necessary for me to move Amendment No. 59 formally?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the first Amendment has been moved. We are taking the others with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I speak to Amendment No. 59 in my name. Whilst not negativing the first part of Clause 1, it redefines what constitutes a night assembly and the period of time covered by the Bill. It also deals with the matter of numbers and the vexed question of the open air.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 59 should be seen together with Amendment No. 60, because I am attempting to place in an entirely different context the way in which we seek
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0189">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>137</span>
to obtain for people attending pop concerts or any other events of this kind the right conditions and regulations governing such events.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is moving that subsequently. Amendment No. 60 is the subject of separate debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I am not going to speak on Amendment No. 60. As you say, Mr. Wallace, it is put down quite separately, but it does follow on what I will have to say on Amendment No. 59.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may come as a surprise to the Committee that I have put down Amendments, having been so opposed to the Bill, but I can only say that I have listened patiently and at length to the arguments of my hon. Friends in this Committee and have been persuaded, at long last, that there is a need on our part to get to grips with this Bill and amend it so as to provide the public at large with the right framework of law so that events can be conducted in the right way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ought to emphasise that I am not thinking specifically of pop festivals. I am thinking of all gatherings. So I am grateful initially to my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved), who suggested that I might play a useful part in the Committee and secondly to all my hon. Friends for convincing me that it is a useful job in trying to amend this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My Amendment No. 59, which I am now speaking to, covers the question of numbers. As the Committee has already discovered from the discussions we have had so far this morning, it is very difficult to look at this subject in an objective way. There has been so much emotive talk broadcast about numbers that it really is most difficult for anyone who has a serious intention with regard to events organised in the open or, for that matter under cover, to decide whether 3,000, 5,000, 10,000, 15,000, 20,000, 25,000 or even 30,000 is the right figure, due to this highly emotive language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sory that the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Crouch) is not here, because he has made a very significant contribution to the absurdity of language that has been used on this subject and I should like to quote from his Second Reading speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman give notice to my hon. Friend? I am sure that if he thought his speech would be quoted, he would have liked to be present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not done so, but I am quite sure that the hon. Member for Canterbury is not very far away and he will be back in the Committee Room whilst I am still on my feet. The hon. Member for Canterbury was referring to the festival due to be held at Bishops-bourne, and said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The promoters in this case, a company called Great Western Festivals Ltd. have been offered a site, at Bishopsbourne in my constituency of some 47 acres. They propose to invite into that area … 250,000 persons to spend days and nights."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 21st January, 1972; Vol. 829, 	<i>c.</i> 909.]</p></blockquote>
I do not know where he got the figure of 250,000 from. Certainly it did not come from the organisers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodnutt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend is not here, I will tell the Committee that he got that information from the promoters who announced that they intended running a pop festival for a quarter of a million, and that it would be the biggest and best ever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Member returns he can give us that information. I can find no source for that information. But I would ask the Committee to consider this; 47 acres, and 250,000 people, represents something like 6,000 per acre. People do not stand up at pop festivals; they sit down. Many of them, if there for a number of days, will take a tent. Wembley Stadium—with people standing up or sitting down—does not accommodate people to that density at all. The figure is patently absurd and no useful contribution was made to the debate when the hon. Member introduced that figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In dealing with the Bishopsbourne festival, is my hon. Friend aware that Great Western Festivals Ltd. are a highly professional, reputable and competent company? The 47 acres to which he referred was the area reserved for the main arena, and a further 80 acres was to be provided for car parking and for camping. Therefore, Great Western Festivals Ltd. had gone right out of their way to ensure that proper space was available. At no time, from any informa-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0190">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>139</span>
tion that has come to me from reputable sources, has the figure of 250,000 been suggested as the number they hoped to encourage to attend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that information, some of which I was aware of, and I think it reinforces the points that I put to the Committee earlier. Nowhere have I seen it suggested that this figure was a reliable one or was ever indicated by Great Western Festivals Ltd., but in fact the hon. Member for Canterbury—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not a fact that this festival did not take place? Great Western Festivals Limited, who are a most reputable company headed by Lord Harlech and Stanley Baker, were treated to a great deal of hostility by the local residents, despite the fact that they were prepared to meet them on every point. So does this not prove that legislation is not necessary because, due to local hostility, and as a reputable company, they decided not to go ahead?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members are getting quite out of order again. Will the hon. Gentleman please come back directly to his Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to come back to the question of numbers, Mr. Wallace. Perhaps I could just finish this point. The hon. Member for Canterbury, in this alarmist atmosphere which, as my hon. Friend has said, eventually brought a halt to any attempts to hold this festival, did not stop at 250,000. He went on to say in the Second Reading debate:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Those are the people they would invite, but the number who could come if the weather is fine—it is only 65 miles from London—could well be double that figure, 500,000, and the situation could get seriously out of hand." [OFFICIAL REPORT, 21st January, 1972; Vol. 829, 	<i>c.</i> 909.]</p></blockquote>
I submit that that is no way in which to approach this whole question of numbers. It is thoroughly alarmist and irresponsible to have attacked a proposed festival in this way. For hon. Members opposite to talk now as though they are trying to be responsible and get the numbers and regulations right for festivals, is rather hard to bear when one realises that this kind of emotive language has been put about by at least one of their number in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>140</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been my desire, if possible, not to refer to individual organisers and so on in the course of this Committee, but since the matter of Great Western Festivals has been raised, the hon. Gentleman's hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Crayford said that Great Western Festivals Ltd. had a great deal of experience in this matter. Would the hon. Gentleman confirm that Great Western Festivals Ltd. were only formed in 1971 and. as far as I know, have hot yet promoted any single pop festival?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Great Western Festivals organisation is a reputable promoter in this field, which has issued a booklet setting out a draft code of conduct. I am advised that it has in its employ people experienced in conducting festivals. That is the answer to the hon. Member's attack on Great Western Festivals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would remind the sponsor of the Bill that there was originally a new Clause which included as exemptions organisations which in the past had conducted festivals in a reasonable manner. I wonder how a group like Great Western Festivals would fare, since, even though they have made it quite clear that they would organise their festivals properly, they have not so far organised a festival. They would not be an exempted group, although the literature which they have published and their organisation as a company shows them to be a highly responsible body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The company concerned is not included in the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was the sponsor of the Bill who introduced that spurious point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Amendment, together with Amendment No. 60, attempts to redefine precisely how we should deal with the problems and difficulties which lie at the heart of our discussions; in other words, the way in which we legislate so as to provide the public—and young people in particular with regard to pop festivals—with the right guarantees in law that, having paid for an entrance ticket, they will be provided with adequate facilities and amenities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, following upon the remarks of the hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen), it is sought to reconcile rather than to reduce the conflict that exists be-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0191">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>141</span>
tween those who live in the countryside and those who visit it in order to enjoy or utilise the open spaces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am putting forward a new philosophy. I believe that we should retain the essential freedoms and liberties which now exist, a point which, in our later deliberations, may prove to be another basis for agreement between the two sides. Even hon. Members opposite have no wish to reduce the freedom which is at present enjoyed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wellbeloved</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In dealing with Amendment No. 48, would my hon. Friend bear in mind that such is the lack of serious intent on the part of hon. Members opposite, that the quorum is at this moment maintained only by courtesy of this side of the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member should address himself to the Amendment. These pleasantries have nothing to do with the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Frankly, it is not a pleasantry. It is rather a reflection of the state of affairs prevailing on the other side of the Committee, at a point when the Commitee is embarking upon a new discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will have been noticed that my Amendment seeks to exclude from the provisions of the Bill those events which take place within the course of 24 hours. Rather than becoming bogged down in various exclusions from the provisions of the Bill, I think we should at one stroke exempt the vast majority of events which take place out of doors—a term which, following a discussion with one of my hon. and learned Friends, I now consider to be preferable to "open air"—by virtue of the fact that they take place within 24 hours or considerably shorter periods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is widely thought that our discussions concern events held in the countryside, and on private land. Once again, I am assured that this is not so. Apparently, the definition of "private land" is not sufficiently clear as to enable us to ignore events held, for example, in Hyde Park
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
or any other Royal Park, the Oval or Lords Cricket Ground, all of which I think many members of the Committee believe to be exempt from the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has referred to the Oval, where a pop festival, or concert, was held. Would such an event have been deemed to have taken place in the open air—How would organisers wishing to sponsor an all-night, or weekend festival be affected by the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am uncertain in this case. Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us. I am convinced that many member of the Committee believe that we are concerned here only with concerts, festivals and open-air events which take place in the open countryside. In my understanding—I am open to correction—events held at the Oval or in Hyde Park or elsewhere could fall within the terms of the Bill since, as my hon. Friend has said, they are held in the open air. Thus the terms of the Bill are much wider than many of us thought when we embarked upon the Committee stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One might well ask why the sponsors of the Bill should not take into account events of the kind I have described. After all, if there is any principle at stake, one would have hoped that it would be all-embracing. This additional information is only now coming to light. I believe that the more we explore the provisions of the Bill, the more will it be discovered that such one-day events as have been held in the past at the Oval or in Hyde Park—thoroughly respectable, well-organised events, that have been commended by everyone, including the police—would fall within the provisions of the Bill. My Amendment would seek to exclude such events. In addition, it provides that 	<i>ad hoc</i> gatherings, which may have assembled to demonstrate against such events as the invasion of Czechoslovakia, or Hungary, would escape the provisions of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
