	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My Bill seeks to amend Section 44(2) of the Police Act, 1964, which at present restricts the activities of the Police Federations by stipulating that they must not be associated with
	<br><blockquote><p>"any body or person outside the police service".</p></blockquote>
As the Committee knows, I have the honour to act as successor to my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South-East (Mr. Callaghan) and the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Eldon Griffiths) as Parliamentary adviser to the Police Federation for England and Wales, which represents all police officers in England and Wales up to and including the rank of chief inspector. The Scottish Police Federation acts for those ranks in Scotland, and the Bill has the full support of the Scottish Federation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The origin of Section 44(2) of the Police Act, 1964, lies in the Police Act, 1919. The Police Federation came into being through the provisions of Section 1 of the Police Act, 1919, in the aftermath of a police strike and of a bitter disagreement over trade unionism in the service. Other provisions of the 1919 Act prohibited members of police forces from becoming members of trade unions and forbade attempts to cause disaffection in the police service, whether by persons inside or outside the service. Section 1(2) provided that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Police Federation and every branch thereof shall be entirely independent of and unassociated with any body or person outside the police service."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Substantially the same provisions, somewhat expanded, are repeated in the Police Act, 1964.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is concerned with Section 44(2) of the 1964 Act, which repeats Section 1(2) of the 1919 Act. There existed in 1919 an unrecognised body called the National Union of Police and Prison Officers. In 1918, that body led a strike involving the majority of constables and sergeants in the London forces. The strike was settled on the understanding that police pay demands would be met and that men who had been dismissed for trade union activities would be reinstated. A further issue at stake in the strike, recognition of the National Union of Police and Prison Officers, was not decided. It was agreed that there could be no recognition of the union in wartime but that the police in London should have an internal organisation to represent them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similar representative bodies were formed in many other forces in 1918 and 1919. In March, 1919, the then Government appointed the Desborough Committee—a Departmental committee—to examine police conditions. In July, 1919, the Desborough Committee reported and recommended the establishment of the Police Federation, a body that would have no outside connections. That is how the Federation came into being more than 50 years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By 1955, the Federation was permitted for the first time to raise funds by voluntary subscriptions from its members. Two years earlier, the Police Council for Great Britain was set up as a Whitley negotiating body for the police. Since then, the Federation has expanded its activities considerably. In the Federation's view, the enactment of the Bill would mean a further step forward. It would give pleasure throughout the police service as renewed confirmation of the respect in which the Federation and its leaders are held both by Parliament and the country at large.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are those who would argue that the change in the law proposed in my Bill is somewhat overdue. The Federation represented to the last Labour Government that the provisions of Section 44(2) were unduly restrictive. My right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South-East undertook to amend the Act when a suitable opportunity occurred.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0296">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
After the General Election, the Federation sought and received a similar assurance from the present Home Secretary. There is thus no disagreement on party lines with the object of this Private Member's Bill. Indeed, it will be noted that the Bill's sponsors come from every part of the House and include right hon. and hon. Members who take a close and specialist interest in the police service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Federation feels that now is the time for its growing influence and acknowledged sense of responsibility to be recognised by the removal of restrictions which may have made sense in earlier generations, but which make no sense in the circumstances of today. The purpose of the Bill is to permit the Federation to associate with certain bodies with whom it has strong mutual interests. Examples of these are the National Association of Retired Police Officers, which looks after the interests of police pensioners and with which the Federation already has a close informal link; the Public Service Pensioners' Council, which deals with matters affecting state pensioners throughout the public service; certain appropriate European and overseas police associations, with which the Federation is anxious to establish close links; and other organisations, or groups of organisations, which in this country have common objectives with the police in matters affecting conditions of service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Federation has, of course, no intention of pursuing any political affiliation. Its members fully recognise the cardinal importance of maintaining the traditional independence of the police. Nor is it intended that the police should affiliate to the Trades Union Congress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of us appreciate the right hon. Gentleman's wish that the Federation should not be subject to any unnecessary or outdated restrictions. I pay warm tribute to the right hon. Gentleman, and to his Ministerial colleagues and officials at the Home Office, for their ready co-operation in the work of preparing the Bill. I know that all members of the Police Federation would want me to acknowledge their most helpful and entirely constructive response to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Buck</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite a lot of those who have put their names to the Bill have been glad to have been asso-
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
ciated with it. We congratulate the hon. Member for Manchester, Wythenshawe (Mr. Alfred Morris) on bringing it forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a precursor to tempting the Police Federation to join the Trades Union Congress. I hope that will be made clear in reports about the Bill for otherwise some sections of the public may lay hold of the wrong end of the stick. I am glad to support the Bill, because it is desired by the Police Federation. At this time, when the police are under a heavy strain, with crime figures mounting, we should be only too glad to do anything which is unobjectionable and regarded as important by the Police Federation whose members are doing a splendid job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member mentioned certain outside bodies. With one, the National Association of Retired Police Officers, the Federation has informal co-operation at the moment, and the Bill will enable that co-operation to be regularised. The hon. Member mentioned 	<i>en passant</i> the foreign organisations. It seems to me that the Federation has an admirable opportunity in the context of our entry into Europe—which is a subject on which I shall not enlarge in the presence of the hon. Member who is bringing forward the Bill. I know that some European bodies are thinking in terms of British leadership, or a substantial element of it, in the reorganisation of European police federation organisations. I do not want to be arrogant about that, but if it were not for the Bill, it would not be possible for the Police Federation to take up leadership of a European federation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that that is one of the most important aspects of the Bill. It will enable the Federation to co-operate with police forces in Europe which are not organised as cohesively—and sometimes not as responsibly—as our own police. I believe that the Bill will be beneficial in the coming years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Mark Carlisle)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of the Government, I welcome the Bill and thank the hon. Member for Manchester, Wythenshawe (Mr. Alfred Morris) for his kind remarks about the Home Office and its officials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0297">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
This is a Bill which the Government support and, as the hon. Member knows, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland have also given it their support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the hon. Member on getting the Bill this far. It went through "on the nod" on Second Reading, and I assume that in a few minutes it will successfully have passed through Committee. It has been useful to have had a short explanation from the hon. Member of the purposes of the Bill. I note that it has all-party support and that many of its sponsors are present today, including my hon. Friend the Member for Colchester (Mr. Buck).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is little to add to what the hon. Member has already said about the purpose of the Bill. It seeks to amend the provisions of Section 44(2) of the 1964 Police Act, which first appeared in similar words in the 1919 Act. As the hon. Member reminded the Committee, that was the date when the Police Federation was formed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the 1919 Act laid down and the 1964 Act repeated was that the Police Federation should be entirely independent of and unassociated with any outside body. The purpose behind that provision was clear: it was to ensure that the police service was not only impartial, but clearly seen to be so. I do not believe that any hon. Member would doubt the impartiality of the police. That factor remains of prime importance, both to the public generally and to the service itself. There is no suggestion in the hon. Member's Bill which would affect the impartiality of the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Colchester mentioned trade union membership and I gather that the Police Federation has no wish to enter into any such association. The Bill makes it clear that any association that it may enter into is only with the authority of the Home Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, while the purpose behind the 1964 provision was right, in recent years the Federation has felt that it was too restrictive, preventing its members from joining associations such as the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
National Association of Retired Police Officers, which obviously would be wholly unexceptionable and would be helpful for the working of the Police Federation. Associations of that kind cannot have any adverse effect upon either the impartiality or the efficiency of the police service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is drawn in such a way that the Federation may associate with an outside body only with the specific authority of the Secretary of State and only on terms and conditions that he may feel fit to impose. There is no doubt that the public interest in the matter is fully safeguarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not provide a blank cheque for the Police Federation, but it meets what I know has been the desire of the Federation to enter into the type of associations that would assist it, particularly with regard to police pensions, to which the Secretary of State would have no objection. Indeed, he would welcome it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reiterate what my hon. Friend said in paying tribute to the work done by the Police Federation on behalf of its members over recent years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
