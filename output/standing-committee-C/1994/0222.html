</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pleasure for me to introduce the Bill to the Committee having had such widespread, cross-party support on Second Reading. It is only the second time I have served on a Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Hill. I remember from the previous occasion your firmness, fairness and good humour. Although I hope that this Committee will be brief, I am delighted to serve on it under your watchful eye. I know of your long experience and I crave your indulgence by allowing me to say a few words about the Bill. I hope that you will guide my enthusiasm and forgive some of my inexperience as our proceedings progress.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
It is unusual for a new Member to present a Bill in Committee, especially in his first term. I am pleased that the Committee contains many Members who spoke so strongly in favour of the Bill on Second Reading. I was given one word of caution about the Bill. An older Member told me that it is rare to get wide, cross-party support, and he reminded me of two other issues for which there was such support: the exchange rate mechanism and the Child Support Agency. I hope that during our deliberations we can find something to disagree on, so that this Bill does not go down the same road as those other two matters.<br><br>
I hope that the Bill will continue to receive such wide, cross-party support, that its provisions will survive for many years and that we can together create a new law of lasting value.<br><br>
Just yesterday, the Select Committee on Education produced a report on "Safety in Outdoor Activity Centres". Written evidence from more than 90 people and oral evidence collected by the Committee showed overwhelming support for the measures proposed in the Bill. It is extremely unusual for a Select Committee to report on a Bill that is before the House. I am pleased that the document launched yesterday by the Select Committee gives us such widespread support.<br><br>
That report serves to remind us how many parents, teachers, governors, local education authorities and children support the Bill. They are all relying on the Committee to get the Bill on to the statute book in a form that is workable and will achieve the Bill's aim of making outdoor activity centres safer for children. I therefore hope that we shall make progress as rapidly as is compatible with proper consideration of the Bill.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 45 to 48 on the selection list deal with the Health and Safety Executive and its role in the Bill. As it stands, the Bill enshrines the requirement that the Secretary of State should consult the Health and Safety Commission. The amendments go beyond that. Amendment No. 45 gives the Health and Safety Commission a very full role, in particular in making nominations to the licensing body. That is appropriate because the Health and Safety Executive was charged, under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974, with the task of advising the Government on safety matters. It is therefore proper that the Health and Safety Commission should recommend the licensing body to the Secretary of State.<br><br>
The other amendments are consequential to amendment No. 45. Amendment No. 46 takes out "Secretary of State" and inserts "Health and Safety Commission" and, with amendment No. 45, it empowers the HSC to make recommendations about the nominations to the licensing committee. Because the HSC will nominate the licensing body, it will also give it guidance and will be required to consult beforehand.<br><br>
The other amendments in the list follow in logical consequence. If we left the Bill as it stands, the HSC would nominate candidates and make recommendations to the Secretary of State; he would then be able to go back to the HSC and consult it over matters that it had already raised, and we would not want that. The subsequent amendments therefore follow on consequentially from amendment No. 45.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0008">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mark Wolfson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sevenoaks)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to challenge Mr. Jamieson's suggestion that the amendments would give the Health and Safety Executive a full role in nominating individuals to the licensing authority. In fact, they would give it a dominant role, which would be regrettable. The purpose and role of the HSE is to minimise all possible risk, especially in work situations. That is quite right and proper and I make no complaints about the HSE having that role.<br><br>
In this situation, however, there is a danger that if such a responsibility were given to the HSE and not left to the discretion of the Secretary of State, the HSE's intention would be the minimisation of all risk. Yet, as I said on Second Reading, with strong backing from some of the best practitioners in the outdoor activity industry—the safety record of which is first class—there is a real danger that one could confine those activities: their adventurous side—the excitement and, therefore, the thrill and the attraction—as well as the opportunity for developing young people, which is provided by allowing what I would call an acceptable risk, could be squeezed out altogether, simply because the HSE has a specific and rather different role in its industrial and commercial settings. It is on that basis that I think that the measure could well be counter-productive and place an unnecessary constraint on the licensing authority's outlook and approach.<br><br>
I want to deal carefully with the issue as I appreciate that certain members of the Committee will tell me that that is what the Bill is about: it is to ensure safe activity, which is absolutely paramount. They may ask who am I to risk any other lives after Lyme bay. If any hon. Members thought that, they are totally out of line with my thinking on the issue.<br><br>
I return to the point, again made on Second Reading, that the industry's record is very good. The Bill deals with a few cowboy institutions. The whole inquiry and court case on Lyme bay demonstrated that that operation was totally out of line by any decent existing safety standards.<br><br>
We should not, therefore, use the Bill to place an unnecessarily heavy hand or an unnecessarily constraining framework on the work of the centres, which need to provide some element of risk, perhaps even occasional danger, provided that the whole concept of the staff and the organisation in those centres is one of a culture of safety first. All of that was missing in Lyme bay where there were unqualified, ill-equipped staff, carrying out activities which, even to a sensible lay man, would have appeared wrong. That is the burden of my point. I do not want the HSE to be given quite such a dominant role as the amendment would provide.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. On a point of clarification: the hon. Gentleman referred to the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) by name—he should have referred to him by his constituency. I just want to prevent the mistake from occurring throughout the morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Piers Merchant <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beckenham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I associate myself with the remarks that the hon. Member for Devonport made about you, Mr. Hill, and about his Bill, with which I strongly agree? It is pleasant that the Bill has reached this stage and I am pleased to participate.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
We need to examine some clauses fairly closely. I am a little unhappy with this group of amendments, not because I question the hon. Gentleman's motive, which I believe to be excellent, but because I am not so sure whether the involvement of the Health and Safety Commission to the extent that he wants will help the Bill.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Wolfson) referred to the HSC's involvement as being dominant. I would tend to describe it as absolute under the terms of the amendments in that, as I understand it, amendment No. 45 will give the Health and Safety Commission a monopoly in the nomination or designation of the person who will exercise the functions set out in regulation. Giving one body—important and relevant though it is—such a major sway is not right. Indeed, there is a strong argument for the designated body being truly independent of the Health and Safety Commission as well as of anyone else.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
The Education Select Committee's report, to which the hon. Member for Devonport referred, states on page DC, paragraph 17:
<br><blockquote><p>"Many witnesses noted the value of the HSE's work, but some were concerned as to whether the HSE was sufficiently expert in the work of activity centres to examine them properly."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not confused about the difference between the Health and Safety Executive and the Health and Safety Commission. Paragraph 17 of the report, to which he referred, is about the Health and Safety Executive. The clause is about the commission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Merchant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fully realise that, although I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for drawing it to the Committee's attention.<br><br>
If it had been considered wise for the Bill's proposals to be controlled by an existing body, we should surely simply have drafted a Bill that amended the responsibilities of that body to incorporate the new responsibilities: the safety and regulation of outdoor activity centres. However, the Bill does not do that. It designates a new body and gives it specific responsibilities. That is a recognition that the area of outdoor centres is a very specialist one which requires special, specific regulation and which draws on people who have expertise in that area. While existing health and safety regulations are relevant and of course applicable, the Bill should enforce a separate layer of such regulation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Jim Spicer <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dorset, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I pursue that point and ask whether organisations such as the Scout Association and the Duke of Edinburgh's award scheme should be closely involved? They have an extremely high standard of expertise in that area and it would be wrong for us to superimpose on such people a body that is not as yet qualified and which should not perhaps be the sole arbiter. I therefore support what my hon. Friend has just said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Merchant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. Friend. He is absolutely right and put the point more succinctly than I did. It is important that all those people who have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0009">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
expertise, are already involved in the area and have for many years shouldered responsibility themselves are involved. That was going to be the second strand of my argument: not only should the Health and Safety Commission not be too specifically involved, as the amendments seek, but other organisations should bear a large, if not equal, responsibility to that of the HSC. I suggested, in a set of amendments which are not being called, amending the relevant clauses to require the Minister and the designated licensing authority to consult more widely, not more narrowly. Rather than the licensing authority and the Minister simply talking to the HSC—let alone being controlled by it—the Minister should be required to consult a wide range of organisations in the outdoor activities area. That, too, is recommended by the Select Committee's report; I am not sure whether it is a specific recommendation, but that is clearly implied.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not clause 3(3) place an obligation on the Secretary of State to consult not just the HSC, but
<br><blockquote><p>"such other persons … as he considers it appropriate to consult."</p></blockquote>
Thus, the hon. Gentleman's point is already dealt with by the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Merchant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. Although I do not want to be dragged into a separate argument, I do not think that clause 3(3) is sufficient. It leaves the judgment as to whether other people should be consulted at all in the hands of the Minister and he is under no requirement to consult those people, as illustrated by the words
<br><blockquote><p>"as he considers it appropriate".</p></blockquote>
Moreover, the Minister can choose the people he thinks are appropriate—he could consult one or two organisations and ignore the other 25, for example. He should be under a duty to consult all relevant organisations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Jim Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I expand on that? Clause 3 surely gives an opportunity to designate the voluntary organisations that would be consulted. I am sure that we all have the greatest confidence in the way in which the Minister will approach the matter, but I should like to see the clause provide more clearly that he will consult with the Scout Association and the Duke of Edinburgh's award scheme, for example. That would be a welcome addition to the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Merchant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, I agree with my hon. Friend. One of the reasons I dislike the amendments is that they make specific reference to, and create a specific duty for, the Health and Safety Commission. It is fair enough to consult the HSC, but it should not be only the Health and Safety Commission that is consulted.<br><br>
My uncalled and rather clumsy amendment was designed to put a specific responsibility on those organisations, although I did not mention them by name. When I attempted to draft my amendment, I did not have a full list but I did not want to exclude any. I therefore referred to education organisations, but had the information been available, I would have done what my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, West (Sir J. Spicer) suggested and specifically referred to them, not just to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
ones to which my hon. Friend referred, but also to education bodies that represent organisations involved in these matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wolfson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that those of us who are uneasy about the amendments are not suggesting that the HSC would not have a full role as a consultee? Our view is that the Bill was right to start with. There are, perhaps, other additions that might be made, but the amendments change unnecessarily the thrust of the Bill, which the promoter got right at the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Merchant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. It is unfortunate that we should have to start by debating the amendments to a Bill which we had thought more suitable without them. It is a retrograde step to give the HSC those extra unnecessary powers at the expense of other potential organisations which would be better involved. I would rather have seen an amendment on those lines.<br><br>
As I do not want to detain the Committee, I shall draw my remarks to a close by making two points. First, amendment No. 48 is a commonsense amendment and states what is the case anyway. It stresses that the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 should apply, as indeed, it does, to outdoor activity centres and that nothing should be done to take away that duty and right. That underlines the point to which my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks rightly drew attention.<br><br>
Finally, I am a little worried about what I believe to be the implications of some of the smaller amendments in this group, which appear to give the Minister a duty of responsibility to the Health and Safety Commission rather than to Parliament. That is unnecessarily restrictive and would extend the Minister's onus towards the Health and Safety Commission instead of towards Parliament. The Minister should answer to Parliament in terms of his order and regulation making powers, and not to the commission.<br><br>
For those reasons, I cannot support the amendments, much as I support the thrust of the Bill and the objectives of the hon. Member for Devonport.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sutton and Cheam)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the fact that the Committee is sitting today. I give my wholehearted support to the hon. Member for Devonport in bringing forward this Bill. On Second Reading, I had only a brief opportunity to express my support for imposing some regulation and discipline on an area in which some very wild cowboys have operated and put children's lives at risk. During the Second Reading debate, I was worried that some of my hon. Friends seemed to suggest that too much regulation would cost a great deal of money. As I said then, no child is worth too much money. The regulation being proposed today is plain common sense.<br><br>
Having said that, I am sorry to say that I do not support the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Devonport. I am not being churlish; I wish to strengthen his position, not weaken it. I agree with my hon. Friends the Members for Beckenham (Mr. Merchant) and for Sevenoaks, who noted that the logical conclusion of the clause would be to put all our eggs in one basket. Only one authority would have the power to make decisions in connection with a host of activities. I should prefer the Secretary of State to be able to select from a number of bodies and choose the most relevant.<br><br>

I do not dismiss the strengths of the Health and Safety Commission. It is an admirable body and does an excellent job. Its responsibilities are limited, however, and some areas would not be covered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give us an example?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will wait a moment, I will give him a precise example.<br><br>
I draw the Committee's attention to a submission made to the Education Select Committee, which was investigating activity centres. The submission is relevant to the background and experience of people working in activity centres. It was made by a Mr. Tyler of Lambourn in Berkshire, who described how he had applied for a job as a chalet cleaner at an activities centre over the telephone—he ended up being employed as an instructor at a centre in north Devon. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I spent one week working with another instructor before being deemed able to teach."</p></blockquote>
The activities that took place at that centre included surfing at a rocky beach, where children had to fall off the board in time, otherwise they would crash on to rocks. No safety helmets were available and absailing took place with staff who did not know how to set up the safety ropes. One young Australian girl—an instructor—was in despair when, on telling the centre's director that the sea was too rough for canoeing, she was told, "If you don't like it, I will employ someone else."<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
The truth is that the Health and Safety Executive is not trained to consider how people are employed by an activity centre. I respectfully suggest that the Secretary of State should have the powers to examine organisations with relevant experience. It is a great mistake to think that, because the HSE is excellent in one area, it should necessarily be deemed to be superb in all others. It is plain common sense that it must be advisable for the Secretary of State to have a much wider brief rather than rely on one single body.<br><br>
I totally support the spirit of the Bill, but the amendment is not particularly helpful and would cramp our style, rather than give the Secretary of State the widest sources of advice to call upon.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hampstead and Highgate)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendments and, in common with all members of the Committee, I welcome the Bill.<br><br>
As a comparatively new Member of Parliament it may be my own ignorance, but I am not clear about the worries expressed by Conservative Members. They seem to fear that making the Health and Safety Commission the defining body will somehow supercsede the powers of the Secretary of State. Under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974, the Secretary of State has powers to replace existing statute and regulations, and the amendments proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Devonport would not infringe those powers.<br><br>
I am not sure how requirements for wide-ranging consultation—both for those who run the activity centres and for safeguards within them—should be implemented. Mention was made of the Scout Association and the Duke of Edinburgh's award scheme—I was rather surprised that nothing was said of the Girl Guides Association because it too has an excellent record.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
Some people who run activity centres are not the best and we are primarily interested in them. Those who are not even the worst, but who are markedly inadequate, clearly did not consult appropriate bodies. Surely we should be worried not only about information for the Secretary of State, but about information for people who set themselves up to run activity centres and charge money for the facilities that they provide. Information is there—it has always been there. Powers upon the Secretary of State to summon such information have been there in the past, are here in the present, and certainly will be there in the future. I am worried that, if the amendments are not on the face of the Bill, too wide a group of people will have to be consulted before licences can be issued. I believe—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Merchant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may finish the sentence. All legislation that has improved health and safety at work—for people at work and for the public who may be part and parcel of the process, whether it is industrial or a service—has come about after a major accident or tragedy. As we all know, that is why we are here today—because of a major tragedy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Merchant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with what the hon. Lady just said. She said earlier, however, that consultation should not be too wide. Does not she feel that close consultation should include organisations representing schools and participating teachers? Should not they have a major input, as well as the Health and Safety Commission?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's point. My worry is not about the depth and breadth of consultation, which clearly must be as absolute as possible, but that there should be more than one defining body for the issuing of licences. That is why I support my hon. Friend's amendments and hope that they will appear on the face of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Lidington <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aylesbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I also begin by offering the hon. Member for Devonport my congratulations on his success in the ballot and his success so far in carrying the Bill through Parliament. I sat in the same hot seat about 12 months ago, piloting through what is now the Chiropractors Act 1994 and I know the amount of work such a Bill entails. I applaud his energy and wish him success.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Devonport opened his remarks with warnings about previous policies that commanded cross-party support at their initiation, but caused cross-party tears and recriminations later. The lesson to be drawn from the ERM is that we are right to make and examine regulations in detail in the House. The lesson from the CSA is that we must ensure that we scrutinise a measure in Committee as closely as possible so that we can not only be content with the principles behind it, but be confident that it will have the desired effect when applied every day to the working lives of men and women who do their best to comply with the law.<br><br>
We must examine the details of the Bill carefully because it confers extensive powers on the Secretary of State. We will be denying ourselves the right to look in detail, during the scrutiny of primary legislation, at
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0011">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
measures that may be brought forward under the enabling powers contained in the Bill. It is incumbent on us to scrutinise the criteria that will govern decisions taken by the Secretary of State, to ensure that a proper balance is struck between the need to strengthen safety requirements, in the wake of the Lyme bay disaster and other similar tragedies, and the need to ensure that men, women and young people get the chance to participate in challenging, adventurous and dangerous activities, as my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks pointed out. Those activities must always be subject to proper supervision and concern for safety. The balance between regulation and freedom is what should motivate us.<br><br>
I am not as hostile to the amendments as my hon. Friends the Members for Sutton and Cheam (Lady Olga Maitland) and for Beckenham, but I have a couple of concerns. They follow on from what my hon. Friends said and I look forward to the comments of my hon. Friend the Minister and the hon. Member for Devonport. One concern is that the amendments might grant exclusive rights to the Health and Safety Commission. Although I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) about the distinction between the commission and the executive, my doubts have been enhanced by the criticisms of the executive which we heard from several witnesses who gave written or oral evidence to the inquiry of the Select Committee on Education.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham touched on the Select Committee's conclusions on the basis of that evidence, but I want briefly to refer to a couple of points that were made. The memorandum of the Consumers Association, published as Appendix 8 to the Select Committee's report, expresses concern that the
<br><blockquote><p>"expertise of the HSE inspectors is not specific to safety in outdoor activity centres."</p></blockquote>
It also said that it was anxious that the HSE's inspection programme would
<br><blockquote><p>"focus principally on the management of health and safety paying minimal attention to the adequacy of any equipment or hardware."</p></blockquote>
Those doubts were echoed by other witnesses. The Scottish Mountain Leader Training Board expressed concern in its written evidence about the quality of inspectors who
<br><blockquote><p>"have not had the requisite experience or qualifications to assess the quality of instruction in the various outdoor activities."</p></blockquote>
Doubts were expressed by organisations other than those representing the activities. Gloucestershire county council, a local education authority with considerable experience in such matters, expressed concern about the HSE's
<br><blockquote><p>"limited knowledge of the industry"</p></blockquote>
and suggested that the first phase of HSE inspections appeared to be targeting simply the better established and credible centres. The county council suggested that perhaps the inspections were not focusing adequately on those centres where there might be the most serious cause for concern.<br><br>
As was acknowledged in the Select Committee report, any final conclusions about the executive's competence must await the full report on its programme of inspection. I am concerned enough to seek some reassurance from the promoter of the Bill and the Minister about the effect that the amendments would have.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
<p><span class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has touched on an important point. Is he aware that the Health and Safety Executive has rather limited experience of visiting activity centres? All told, there are 3,000 activity centres in the country. There could be more that we do not know about and yet the HSE has visited a mere 200 or 300.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lidington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point, which brings me to the comments of the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson). We are dealing with a range of centres. No one knows exactly how numerous they are. The Bill does not provide a precise definition of the centres—that is to be left to regulation and secondary legislation. Therefore, my doubts about whether the HSC should have exclusive rights are reinforced because we are not even sure what we mean by an activity centre over which the HSC should have such influence.<br><br>
We are discussing centres operated directly by local education authorities, by commercial, profit-making organisations, or by voluntary and charitable organisations such as the Girl Guides Association and the Scout Association. Although it depends on the definition embodied in eventual secondary legislation, we are perhaps discussing activity centres that form but one—perhaps relatively minor—part of a more broadly based institution. It is quite possible to envisage a leisure centre which decides to install a mountain climbing wall or start some other activity which might be covered by the regulations that would arise out of the Bill if it became law. That problem with the diversity of provision—and who knows how much diversity will increase in the future—leads me to express concern about the amendments.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Jim Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can I give one example of that diversity? I am sure that many hon. Members are also members of the Westminster gymnasium and go there to exercise every day. In the past—and this is part and parcel of the outside activities in which the gymnasium engages—members of the gymnasium have been taken to an Army assault course.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman tell us how many members are under the age of 18?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Jim Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: None in our gymnasium, but people under 18 can be members of such places, and I know of other cases in which they are taken out to use Army facilities. How widely, therefore, should we draw our definition? If we go too far, we shall finish up with a raft of new inspectors who have been specially appointed to a task for which they are not particularly suited. We must ensure that we use the expertise that already exists, including—and I add this for the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate—that in the guides and scouts. We should not create a vast new team of inspectors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are getting away from the issue. Also, hon. Members must declare their interests when they speak on a subject close to their heart.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lidington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether I should declare my interest as a regular user of the Commons gymnasium; however, I have not yet experienced the Army assault course.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
The hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate expressed concern about the consultation process within Whitehall. She was concerned that, if the amendments are not accepted, Departments might be asked to spread their attention too widely. I can speak only from limited experience of Whitehall. However, from my three years as a ministerial advisor, it seems to me that the risk in Whitehall is not that the list of consultees will be too long, but that it will be too narrow and based on the large organisations and established representative groups that already have frequent official access to the Department concerned.<br><br>
I understand the necessity for frequent contact with those organisations and the convenience of having those regular channels of communication for Government Departments. However, I always felt uneasy about the fact that Government Departments often overlooked the interests of relatively small or newly-established organisations and representative bodies.<br><br>
Because the list of consultees was often too narrowly based, there were later found to be unforeseen side effects in the implementation of legislation. Therefore, I should not want to amend the Bill in a way that would reinforce the excessive temptation towards cosiness in the consultation between Whitehall and the outside world. I hope that I shall be given the reassurance that I seek, but I none the less have concerns about the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. There is an inconsistency in what we have heard. Either the splits in the Conservative party are much greater than we are told and Conservative Members do not trust their Minister, or there is a total misunderstanding of the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 and its subsequent amendments. Let us be charitable and assume that it is the latter.<br><br>
If hon. Members care to look at section 13 of the 1974 Act, which refers to the duties of the commission, they will see that the issues that have been raised today are irrelevant. Section 12 makes it clear that the Secretary of State for Employment can give instructions to the commission. Section 13(l)(a) makes it clear that the commission can
<br><blockquote><p>"make agreements with any government department"—</p></blockquote>
and the Department for Education comes into that category.<br><br>
Given the powers contained in section 13, the issues raised this morning are totally and utterly meaningless. It is clear that the Secretary of State can be involved in this process and can require the commission to appoint any such person as is appropriate for the carrying out of these functions. Section 13(l)(d) gives the commission the power
<br><blockquote><p>"to appoint persons or committees of persons to provide the Commission with advice in connection with any of its functions".</p></blockquote>
The list contained in the 1974 Act makes the line of responsibility quite clear. It has nothing to do with the executive, unless the commission wants it to be involved.<br><br>
Some hon. Members have made great play of paragraph 17 of the Select Committee's report, but that is misleading. The worries that have been expressed can be dealt with by the Secretary of State, in conjunction with his colleague in the Department for Education, by requiring the commission to act in a particular way. So what is the problem?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr, Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall detain the Committee for no more than a minute in order to add to what my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston has just said. The HSC has 12 advisory committees to advise the Government on safety, one of which is the education services advisory committee. Its members are drawn from the Health and Safety Executive, teaching and non-teaching unions, local education authorities and other interested parties, including the Department for Education, the Welsh Office, independent schools and voluntary-aided employers. So there is already a committee within the HSC that is charged with examining the health and safety of those involved in education, including workers, students and even members of the public.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Merchant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that I speak for my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) when I say that we are well aware of the powers of the commission and its distinction from the executive, but that is not the point at issue. Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that it would be easier and clearer for the purposes of the Bill to have a direct link between educational and other relevant organisations and the Minister, rather than this tortuous, remote and second-hand method via the HSC?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I cannot agree with the hon. Gentleman. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston said, the HSC, through its education services advisory committee, has a specific role to advise the Government on safety issues. There is wide representation on that committee and, in addition, the Bill provides for wider consultation with the bodies that have been referred to by the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that we should be too prescriptive in saying what course the Secretary of State should follow in seeking advice. There is a serious danger that if he follows only the HSC channel, he will receive only one source of advice. It is extremely important that the Minister has free and clear access to independent views and to whatever body he chooses. That is not to diminish the importance of the HSC, which does very valuable work, but if the Secretary of State relied on that channel alone, he might pick up only the HSC's enthusiasms and peccadilloes. If other, independent organisations came to him directly, he would have the power to decide which source was most useful. Maybe he would want a mix—who knows?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department for Education (Mr. Eric Forth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I echo the words of welcome already expressed to you, Mr. Hill? I am sure that we all find your chairmanship very reassuring.<br><br>
I shall have to pick my way through what has become a complex series of issues, although the amendment and, indeed, the Bill, appear relatively straightforward. I will help the Committee by giving the Government view and responding, as my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury requested, by making it clear that the essence of clause 1 is the initial setting up and appointment of the crucial licensing body. We are therefore considering the most appropriate way for that process to take place.<br><br>
How will the Secretary of State set about that vital task? We all understand that the nature and role of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0013">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
licensing body will be linked to the success of the Bill and to its effectiveness in delivering that standard of safety at outdoor centres that we all want. I concede immediately the point made by my Friend the Member for Sevenoaks and others, that throughout the exercise, initially and subsequently we will have to ensure that we retain a sensible balance between maintaining a proper degree of safety for young people in the centres and a sensible degree of excitement and challenge—which are exactly the qualities that we expect from the centres. That will be in everybody's minds during our proceedings.<br><br>
However, we would surely also want the licensing body to operate in harmony with those bodies that are responsible for safety in other areas of Government. That must be right. Of course, I accept that there is a considerable difference between the normal activities of the HSC and more particularly of the HSE, in delivering its responsibilities under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974, and the role that the new body will discharge. Again, we all understand that. We are faced with setting up a new body to discharge important new functions, which are closely related to the whole area of health and safety. I therefore feel that it is not unreasonable to expect the body to which the Government turn for advice on health and safety matters generally to have an important role at this early stage in determining the nature of the licensing authority to which the Bill is going to give so much responsibility. The thrust of the amendments is therefore logical. I understand my hon. Friends' reservations and I shall do my best to allay them, but I hope that they will see the logic of the Bill's provision that the Government will look first for advice and input on setting up the new body to the body that normally gives such advice.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
We must also recognise—this point was raised by Opposition Members—that while the HSC, as a non-departmental public body that gives expert and independent advice to Government, as many other bodies do, is independent of Government, it has to have a harmonious relationship with the Secretary of State of the day, as one would expect. The suggestion that the HSC will go off on some great jag in order to give unacceptable or outrageous advice to the Secretary of State and then say, "There it is—take it or leave it", is unrealistic. It does not work that way. I ask my hon. Friends to accept, from their knowledge of the way in which Government work, that it cannot work that way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wolfson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With his experience of schools, could the hon. Gentleman give us examples in the school curriculum which are germane to the curriculum—if I can call it that—of the centres? Does the Health and Safety Executive—[HON. MEMBERS: "Commission"]—I apologise, does the HSC have an involvement with curriculum activities in schools?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The direct answer to my hon. Friend is no, but I do not think that that would in any case come within the role of the licensing body envisaged in the Bill. That role is of course subject to guidance from the promoter, but the responsibility of the new body will be to ensure safety in the centres, despite the fact that they are involved in activities that are of great importance in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
education. We must remain focused on that and not be tempted to stray into the area to which my hon. Friend referred, although we should acknowledge that there will always be an important overlap between those areas. There should also be close co-operation between the HSE—with its responsibilities for employees in the centres, which will continue under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974—and the new agency. Its responsibilities have yet to be defined, following consultation; that is why we do not know as much at this stage as we would like about the precise nature of the agency. I suspect that as the promoter of the Bill looks further into it, members of the Committee will be impatient to know more about the agency and how it will work. I can understand that impatience, yet time and again we may well hear the promoter saying, "We cannot know those details because, as we said on Second Reading and throughout the debate, we have to consult and we want that consultation to be real." I hope that I am not digressing too much, but I want to say that that would help allay the unhappiness expressed by a couple of my hon. Friends about who will be listened to in the consultation process. The definition of the detailed way in which the agency will operate and the parameters of its activities will arise from the wide consultation process that will take place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam, I want to say that the HSC is obliged, under its remit to consult widely on the way it discharges its responsibilities. Far from the consultation process being too narrow, I suspect that the danger is that we are going to consult ourselves to death. However, we will not do that, because we have had experience of these matters. The Commission and the Department for Education are very adept at consultation <i>[Interruption.]</i> and we do it with great frequency. I think I can give my hon. Friends that assurance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might tease out of my hon. Friend the Minister—although he is reluctant to be moved to give us much guidance as to the sort of agency he envisages—whether he expects it will comprise existing component organisations, such as the HSE and others, or does he intend to start from scratch and bring in experts from business to create a totally new body? What size will the agency be? Where would it be based, and how much funding would my hon. Friend be prepared to provide?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend illustrated all too well the point that I made. Tempted though I may be to answer as many of her questions as possible, it would be inappropriate for me even to start doing so at this stage, before the Committee has deliberated and has a clear idea of the shape of the Bill. I suspect that it will emerge in the same sort of shape—that is, as principally an enabling measure. The consultations to which I referred will follow, and during them we will find, as we build towards the regulations that will give effect to these matters, the answers to the sort of questions that my hon. Friend has asked, about the nature of the agency, its size, scope and operation.<br><br>
I shall allow myself to say, in the spirit of the Second Reading debate, that we all want the agency to have the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0014">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
lightest possible touch and to be of minimal size, scope and staffing, which is consistent with its discharging the responsibilities that will flow from the Bill. We can say that with certainty and I believe that was the unanimous view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend alarms me somewhat when he talks about lightness of touch. Surely that means a total lack of bite? If the agency does not have any bite, it will not fulfil the purpose that we want, of regulation and control. That is not too cramping, but the agency must have the bite and the authority that we seek.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That brings us back to the question of balance. I am perfectly content at the thought that we can and will end up with a regime, a body, an organisation that will be able to combine effectiveness with non-intrusiveness—if I may put it in that rather inelegant way. We already have considerable experience in related matters as diverse as the Ofsted schools inspection regime and the Health and Safety Executive with its various branches. We should be able to devise a regime of satisfactory size and shape to cover approximately 3,000 centres of varying natures and the sort of responsibilities that the Bill's promoter envisages.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the agency have the power to censure an activity centre and to close it down if it has gone beyond the bounds of acceptable behaviour?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answers to those questions lie within the Bill, around clause 1(3)(i), (j) and (k). We will come to that in our subsequent deliberations, not least in the clause stand part debate. There can be no doubt that there will certainly be such powers.<br><br>
While I understand the fears expressed by my hon. Friends, the amendments make sense and are at one with the purposes of the Bill. I see no reason for my hon. Friends to fear that the benign and positive role of the HSC as a non-departmental advisory body to Government, having the essential experience. That experience will be needed when we set up the body ab initio. We cannot prejudge its nature, but I am comfortable with the thought that the amendments give the Bill the right initial shape, by allowing the Secretary of State to be advised and guided by the HSC. The amendments imply that the Secretary of State would retain discretion, as all Secretaries of State must. The relationship will not mean that the commission will have absolute power or that the Secretary of State will be unnecessarily hemmed in. To state otherwise is not a fair reflection of that relationship.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Merchant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister has been reassuring mostly, but in exercising the powers granted him in the Bill, will he make a regular point of consulting organisations that represent teachers and educational establishments that use the centres? It strikes me as only reasonable that regulations affecting activities in which people from educational establishments are involved should take into account their practical experience.<br><br>
Before I spoke on Second Reading, I talked at length with a teacher who took pupils to activity centres. Only through hearing teachers' experiences can one pick up details that one will not learn or discover through official
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
inspections or dealing with the organisers of activity centres.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's question allows me to make another modest plug for the way in which the Dept for Education goes about its business these days. At the risk of arousing further hilarity among Opposition Members I shall do so again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Llin Golding <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle-under-Lyme)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: And on the Government side of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I must be careful—given the unusual arrangements in the Committee.<br><br>
The Department of Education recently tried to develop policies through real consultation. Sir Ron Dealing's successful work on the curriculum comes into that category, as does our development of the special educational needs code of practice, which is also a success. We will follow the same path in the development of our under-fives policy.<br><br>
We learnt the lesson that it is to the advantage of the Department and of policy development to consult as widely and meaningfully as possible—especially in areas such as this, where there are so many different levels of expertise and experience, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham noted. I am confident that the consultation required by the Bill will be wide and meaningful and that it will guide us in the way we form the regulations. I hope that I have been able to allay the fears of my hon. Friends sufficiently that they feel able to support the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very pleased that we have found some points of disagreement. That allows me to hope that the Bill will go through in the form required and that cross-party support will help it to become good legislation.<br><br>
I thank the hon. Members who contributed to the debate. They raised interesting and useful points that needed to be flagged up. I thank the Minister also for his clear and expert explanation of the roles of the HSE and the HSC within the Bill.<br><br>
A number of hon. Members noted that we all want children to be able to undertake challenging, hazardous and exciting activities, but that we must draw the line at putting children in danger. A careful distinction must be made between activities that are challenging, hazardous, exciting and good for children and activities that pose an unacceptable risk. I am sure that we all agree and that should be the driving force behind the Bill.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
The present difficulty is that the balance is wrong and there is no proper framework within which activity centres can operate. Hence the public, parents, teachers and governors have reported—as made clear to the Select Committee too—a considerable loss of confidence in the industry, certainly since the Lyme bay tragedy, because they can never be sure whether they are choosing a centre operating at a safe or unsafe level.<br><br>
The HSE brought out an excellent report during the Select Committee's deliberations, which made it clear that about 10 per cent. of the 200 centres that they examined were operating at unacceptable safety levels. In
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0015">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
certain centres, action had to be taken to rectify the situation.<br><br>
There is a danger, born of our anxiety to know what will come later in regulations, in finding ourselves debating other issues now and trying to put them on the face of the Bill. The Minister properly pointed out that before we can see the detail, we must have the fullest possible consultation with relevant bodies and organisations. Hon. Members who are not on the Select Committee—of whom there are a number here—should know that there were 90 submissions of written evidence from a wide range of interested bodies—parents who had lost their children, LEAs, teacher organisations, safety organisations, people in the world of outdoor activities and pursuits, commercial centres and others. It is significant that the majority of evidence supported the main thrust of the Bill.<br><br>
Committee members asked about the roles of the HSE and the Health and Safety Commission. Paragraph 17 of the Select Education Committee report notes that witnesses felt that the HSE had other priorities over the years than examining activity centres. They pointed to the large number of accidents and fatalities that took place in quarries, building sites and places of work. It is proper for the HSE to determine priorities in line with its budget and to identify relative risks within specific organisations. That does not mean that the HSE cannot have a useful role in being consulted and giving advice to the Government.<br><br>
As to HSE inspectors who carried out the 200 inspections of activity centres, conflicting evidence came before the Select Committee. Some witnesses said that the inspectors had been excellent, well equipped and knowledgeable in their sphere—but as they had not undertaken such a wide programme of inspection before, it is understandable that some inspectors were not as expert in the specific area of the hazards and dangers of outdoor activities. If the Bill is passed, the required specific expertise will be built up over the years. As the culture of safety is extended and becomes enmeshed in our system and law, such expertise will become more general.<br><br>
There may be some misunderstanding about the role of the HSC and hon. Members might be confused by the number of amendments that are to sweep through the Bill. It is sometimes difficult to see what effects the amendments would have when taken together and we should perhaps consider them in the following terms. In the first instance, the HSC would be able to nominate the person or persons it wanted to form the licensing body. The Secretary of State would receive nominations and recommendations and it would be for him or her to make the ultimate appointment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wolfson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Am I not right in assuming that, as a result of the amendments, although the Secretary of State would still have the authority to make the appointment, he would be able to appoint only those people passed by the Health and Safety Commission?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State would appoint the nominee of the Health and Safety Commission. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) said, the commission and its education services advisory committee embrace a wide range of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
interests and of bodies, which would presumably participate in making that nomination. It would be within the gift of the Secretary of State to accept the nomination, or to ask for further nominations, were he or she not satisfied with the one that had been made.<br><br>
The amendments to clause 3(3) merely establish
<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State shall consult the Health and Safety Commission".</p></blockquote>
Thus, the Health and Safety Commission will be consulted, and that was made clear in the original Bill.<br><br>
Clause 3(4) gives the Health and Safety Commission the power to submit proposals for regulation to the Secretary of State as appropriate. However, it is within the gift of the Secretary of State to decline those recommendations. That is the role of the HSC, and it is not overbearing. It is a proper and sensible role within the framework of the Bill.<br><br>
Clause 3(3) deals with the other persons who may be consulted. The Select Committee report was mentioned, and it is clear that a wide range of people feel that they should be properly consulted on this issue. I do not want to say now which bodies should be consulted. I have a number of people, bodies and organisations in mind, and some were suggested by hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Dorset, West (Sir Jim Spicer), who mentioned the scouting and guide organisations. It would be perfectly proper for those organisations to be consulted, just as they were able to submit evidence to the Select Committee. If we tried to draw up a list now of those who should be consulted, we would probably miss out some organisations. I therefore expect that, if the Bill is enacted, the Secretary of State will put out a general invitation to all bodies with a proper interest in this issue to make representations on the regulations and their implementation in the statutory instruments that will follow.<br><br>
I turn now to the agency and the licensing body, although I do not want to trespass into matters concerning the secondary legislation that would presumably follow the enactment of the Bill. That body would be small and compact and would have a light touch. However, that does not mean that it would not have the proper powers to act when it needed to do so. It might be a small, compact body, but under clause 2 and the latter parts of clause 1, as the Minister said, a centre not operating within the framework of the law or under the code of practice set down once the Bill was enacted, would be committing an offence. That is different from the current situation. The measures would bring the centres into the framework of the law and create a criminal offence that does not now exist; it is not a criminal offence to act without a licence.<br><br>
I also envisage the licensing body dealing with the inspection, which would not necessarily be undertaken by HSE inspectors. Evidence was presented and suggestions made to the Select Committee that an inspection body should be set up, comprising people experienced and competent in outdoor pursuits. Those people would then report their findings to the licensing body, which would act on the information as appropriate. It might act by calling in the HSE to institute a prosecution against a centre where the inspection had highlighted unacceptable risks and hazards to children, or which was not operating within the code of practice to which it had agreed.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0016">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
The other function of the agency would be to take advice from the successor body of the ACAC. That committee should be set up with people who have wide experience and knowledge of outdoor activities as the ACAC is now. Such people are properly the ones who should give advice to the licensing body from time to time, about any changes that might be needed. In a year or so, the Secretary of State might have to come before the House to ask for a further regulation to plug a gap, possibly to do with a new activity or with an issue that was causing concern. Who knows, we might have underwater bungee jumping or other activities, which might require the Secretary of State's proper attention.<br><br>
I hope that, between us, the Minister and I have covered the points that were raised during the debate. I urge members of the Committee to support the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Merchant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 21, in page 1, line 10, after "recreational", insert ", educational".</span></p>

<p>No. 22, in page 1, line 14, leave out from "not" to end of line 15 and insert

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Merchant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We heard in the previous debate that there was a fair amount of vagueness in the Bill. We are told that that is necessary and I am prepared, slightly grudgingly, to accept that.<br><br>
This group of amendments is principally about definitions. I want to draw the definitions a little more tightly than they are drawn in the Bill. Amendment No. 21 aims to close what I consider to be a possible loophole. By using the word, "educational", it is possible to cover more comprehensively the difficult definition of what exactly an outdoor activity centre is. The difficulty has been apparent in all the discussions about the Bill and, indeed, in the discussions in the run-up to it. The Select Committee report mentions the problem. Paragraph 6, on the background to the inquiry, on page vi of the report states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The term 'outdoor activity centres' is difficult to define, and is often used as a shorthand for a range of institutions ranging from those offering holidays with an element of outdoor recreation to centres in the Welsh and Scottish mountains offering advanced training in mountaineering and rock-climbing."</p></blockquote>
It also draws attention to the difference between outdoor activity centres and outdoor programmes, which might be based in youth hostels or field study centres, and those that may or may not have a permanent base.<br><br>
The report lists a fairly comprehensive range of outdoor activities, which I will not repeat. It is often difficult to think of a term that covers all those activities. Recreation covers some but not all.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
12 noon<br><br>
It strikes me that, with regard to the Bill's purpose, the word "educational" is a fairly thorough description. The activities that are covered are all intended, or are mostly intended, to be educational. That is why schools send children to the centres and why parents allow it. The whole purpose, as far as the educational system is concerned, is being involved. In most of their publicity, centres make a point of describing the activities that they provide as educational. That is the definition that they have chosen and the hook with which they catch their custom.<br><br>
As the Bill's intention is to protect those under 18-year-olds who, as part of their school-time activities, go to such activity centres, it is important that the word "educational" is included. Paragraph 6 on page vi of the Select Committee report gives a "useful working definition", perhaps the best that they have been able to identify, in a quote from the Health and Safety Executive:
<br><blockquote><p>"Establishments which provide one or more outdoor activities … to which participants come for leisure, sport, for personal development or for educational purposes."</p></blockquote>
So the word "educational" is specified.<br><br>
However, is that word sufficient? It covers trips, visits and placements but is its scope wide enough? Possibly. It is worth considering whether we want its meaning to be wider and the Bill to cover all adventure activities, including those that are clearly non-educational. Do we want "educational" to cover sport clubs, yachting clubs, ski centres and general activity centres, of which there are many around the country and which do not cater for school groups? They cater, perhaps, for individuals or for families. One thinks of CentreParcs, for example, which are entirely recreational centres and do not, as far as I know, cater for school visits. They may do, but I know that many such centres do not. I would not object if the Bill covered them because there needs to be regulations and a safety system to cover such centres. But that is not the point; it is not encompassed by the Bill.<br><br>
Clause 1(2) uses the words
<br><blockquote><p>"sporting, recreational or outdoor activities".</p></blockquote>
The term "sporting" does not cover all the activities that the Bill is intended to include. There is a not particularly clear distinction about what is and is not sporting, but I do not think that term covers all that we intend.<br><br>
The word "recreational" is certainly not suitable. Many recreational activities do not involve outdoor centres or include activities that we are trying to regulate. Similarly, the word "outdoor" is unsuitable, because not every outdoor activity is within the scope of the Bill. Indeed, the word "outdoor" puzzles me slightly because some activities that we want the Bill to cover are not strictly outdoor activities, but take place in a covered building.<br><br>
It is important to insert the word "education", because that addresses the precise purpose of the Bill and it qualifies the other three words in the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman realise that, by approaching this matter in such a way, he is excluding a group of people who are outside the formal education process but are undergoing some training? The hon. Gentleman's fears are dealt with by the clause in its entirety, including the complexities of the double negative
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0017">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
in clause 1(2)(b) which I am sure the Department for Education can explain, because the word "instruction" covers both education and training. His proposal would undermine the meaning of the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Merchant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I am happy to be reassured. My amendments are designed to correct what I regard to be an inadequacy in the Bill—in that sense they are probing amendments. That is necessary because the Bill is drafted so widely and has a vague element. It depends on the regulations that will follow, so it is important to make these matters clear.<br><br>
I am not totally reassured, even though the hon. Gentleman interprets the Bill in that way. The sort of training to which he referred could be legitimately classified as educational, but if that were not the case, the answer would be to include training as part of the definition.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's reference to "instruction" worries me for a different reason, because my amendments also seek to amend that part of the clause. It is possible to envisage instruction in a context other than an outdoor centre providing the educational facilities that we want. Instruction can be given at a sports club. For example, football instruction can be given on a team basis or on a one-to-one basis. That widens the Bill a little too much: I would not want every football club to be dragged automatically into the compass of the Bill.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 22 and 28 would define what is and is not covered. We should examine this matter closely because we do not want suddenly to discover that the Bill covers too wide an area and is unnecessarily restrictive in other areas, nor do we want it to be so narrow that it is found not to cover, say, an indoor climbing centre because it does not fall within the definition of "sporting, recreational, or outdoor" activities.<br><br>
My solution to that problem would be to remove the reference to instruction or leadership in clause 1(2)(b). There could be a situation in which supervision was given, but instruction and leadership was not. There could easily be confusion about where instruction begins and ends, and certainly where leadership begins and ends because that is a very vague term, and perhaps where supervision begins, which may not cover instruction for leadership. The definition could easily be too wide or too narrow. I think that that provision is faulty.<br><br>
Amendment No. 22 focuses on the nature of the adventure activities rather than on the facility itself. I deliberately worded the amendment in that way because we should principally be considering the nature of the activity rather than the nature of the facility. It is not what might exist, but what people are doing that is important. We are seeking to protect people who are taking part in an activity that has some potential for risk. I would like the definition to deal with the activity rather than with the facility.<br><br>
People take part in activities at sea, and one could argue that the water is not a facility because nobody owns it, it is just there. The ordinary man in the street would never describe the sea or a river as a facility, but he could easily define and describe the activity that is taking place on the water. Therefore, we should provide a much clearer and more specific definition. The activity provides the risk, the facility—if a wide definition is used—does not. In any
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
case, my amendment would provide a clearer definition and a more pertinent description of what we are trying to protect.<br><br>
The amendment would provide a fairer way of dealing with the matter. It would be incumbent on us to interpret the law as applying equally to all those who are providing or enabling certain activities to take place, without an element of picking and choosing. For all those reasons, the purpose of the Bill would be better and more clearly advanced if the amendments were accepted. It would also be better law because the Bill would give a more specific definition rather than leaving it to later regulation and possible misinterpretation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I draw the Committee's attention to amendment No. 39? It would leave out subsection (2)(b), which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"facilities which do not consist of, or include some element of, instruction or leadership."</p></blockquote>
I tabled this amendment on the advice of the Consumers Association which has had long experience of examining the work of outdoor activity centres. It submitted a memorandum to the Education Select Committee during the earlier stages of its inquiry.<br><br>
The Consumers Association's experience is based on a number of internal inquiries that it has carried out. Only this year, it produced another paper after having sought submissions from 100 schools. It discovered that schools feel helpless because, when they try to inquire into an activity centre, they do not have a clue what to look for. They know that the onus is on them to examine such centres, but they have no experience of doing so. If an activity centre says, "Yes, we are totally covered in all the areas you are asking us about in terms of experience, qualifications, equipment and first aid", how can the school know otherwise?<br><br>
The Consumers Association has discovered a worrying loophole that might arise out of the clause. The hon. Member for Devonport said on Second Reading that he wanted to avoid placing a heavy burden on people who, for example, hire out pedal boats on a lake in a public park. The trouble is that, by exempting such services, we might be in danger of exempting services that should be caught by the Bill. I am thinking of children taking rides on elephants or other animals in a zoo, or on a donkey at the beach. What happens if something goes drastically wrong with such rides? Whose fault is it? Who has the responsibility to ensure that such rides are supervised correctly?<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
The Consumers Association, which has examined such problems in much greater depth than I, is also worried about unscrupulous operators who could use every device to avoid being caught by the Bill. A centre might be able to say, "Oh no, we're not providing instruction or leadership. People are only being accompanied". That would mean that there could be "accompanied" climbing trips in the Cairngorms, or "accompanied" horse riding expeditions into Snowdonia, as opposed to trips on which children were led or taught. That would be a crafty device to avoid being caught by the Bill. Such a device could open up the way for small cowboy operators to wriggle out of their responsibilities.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0018">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Yardley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the effect of the Bill that schools would be able to ask whether such operators were properly registered? They would not go to the cowboy operators, because those operators would have to answer in the negative.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is true, but they might. We want to prevent schools being put in that position. They need to know that an accompanied trip is unsatisfactory. Any operator running such services must come within the ambit of the Bill.<br><br>
I shall give an example. As a birthday treat for my son, I arranged for he and his friends to go to the hugely popular Clapham karting centre. That centre seemed to be operated properly, and when we arrived a young man gave the children instruction. In hindsight, I admit that I do not know whether the instruction was sufficient, although all the children survived the experience without crashing into each other or into a wall. Nevertheless, the difficulty existed. However, the Consumers Association asserts that such a centre might give its customers a short note on how to drive a kart so as to ensure that it would not be covered. The staff would not act as instructors, nor would they provide leadership: they would claim that karting was a do-it-yourself activity, entirely up to the customer.<br><br>
I want to suggest an alternative definition to cover such activities. I suggest that the word "require" should precede the words
<br><blockquote><p>"some element of, instruction or leadership"</p></blockquote>
in clause 1(2)(b). That would make it clear that a DIY activity is covered by the Bill.<br><br>
I should welcome clarification as to which activities are envisaged to be outside the scope of the Bill. That is very important. There is no such thing as a wily operator who will not find a useful way round measures that will cramp his style and prevent him from taking an extra penny or two. We must examine those activities that legitimately can be classified as outside the scope of the Bill, as well as those that are within its scope. The Consumers Association has much experience. Many of its staff focus on sporting, holiday and recreational activities. Its views should be heeded, and I hope that the Minister will answer some of the points that have been raised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lidington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak to the amendments in this group, but I want to respond briefly to what my hon. Friend has just said. Although I took note of some of the points that she made and look forward to the clarification that she sought, I think that the Consumers Association is wrong.<br><br>
The Bill excludes from the requirement to obtain a licence a facility that does not provide instructional leadership in the activity on offer. The amendment would remove that exemption. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms Morris) was right to say that consumers—be they private or a school's teachers or governors—will, when they consider whether they should take their children to a centre, ask first whether that centre has a licence. If the facility is unlicensed, they will be wary of allowing the children under their care to take part in the activities on offer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: An unscrupulous centre would tell the school, "Don't worry, it's not necessary". It would claim that its activity did not come under the legislation
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
and that the children would not be exposed to such dangers. Such a response would increase the burden on the school. We must seek to remove the possibility of doubt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Teachers are responsible people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lidington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Yardley is right: teachers are acutely aware of their responsibilities for the safety of the children in their care. I must declare an interest, in that I am married to a teacher, but I have more confidence in the clause than does my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam. With some trepidation, I must tell my hon. Friend that she should have more confidence in the operation of market forces. They will provide the remedy.<br><br>
The trouble with the amendment is that it might lead to unnecessary bureacracy being imposed on organisations such as that mentioned on Second Reading by the hon. Member for Devonport. Those organisations fall outside the scope of any definition of activity centres that the people who have framed the Bill had in mind.<br><br>
I should be grateful for clarification about the point at which one might say that instruction or leadership exists. The example that came to mind as I listened to the debate was that of orienteering. An orienteering club might hold competitions and the teams taking part might include young men and women under the age of 18. Those people may have team mates who have passed the age of majority. That example should be compared with an orienteering course where instruction is given in taking part in the sport safely.<br><br>
In the latter case, a licence would be required under the Bill for the instruction centre to demonstrate that it is taking all necessary safety provisions. In the example of a competition sponsored by an orienteering club, a licence would not be required. Will my hon. Friend the Minister and the hon. Member for Devonport explain how that problem can be tackled? What is the point at which instruction or leadership can be deemed to have taken place?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Jim Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise to express my worry about how we are developing our arguments. My hon. Friend may have a point, but I know what started off this exercise in the mind of the hon. Member for Devonport and why we are all supportive of it. If we start extending the Bill's scope to karting, this activity and that activity, we shall be playing around for three or four years—at the end of which, no effective action will have been taken. Let us make a beginning. Let us get on with the Bill. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] Let us stop exploring different avenues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, West. Nevertheless, I understand some of the reservations expressed by my hon. Friends. My reading and my officials' reading of the Bill is that there should be a definition of the activities that we want the Bill to encompass. That is the starting point. There will always be problems at an early stage in dealing with boundaries, definitions and possible anomalies. However, we can delimit the problem by making it clear that we are talking not only about educational activities.<br><br>
We do not want the Bill to apply to the classroom or the school playing field. Neither do we want it to apply to a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0019">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
shop selling only sports equipment. That helps to set the limits of where we do—or rather do not—want to be. Like the elephant mentioned by my hon. Friend, it is difficult to define but we all know when we see it. The challenge for the Bill and the regulations to follow will be to provide a satisfactory definition, so that we can set the normal limits and get on with the job.<br><br>
Despite my hon. Friends' reservations, the Bill's wording is as close as we are likely to get to a satisfactory approach. The Bill sets out what sort of activity centre will be covered, states essentials and defines areas that will be excluded. I put this question to my hon. Friend. If a centre did not provide some degree of instruction or leadership, is it likely that schools would want to send pupils there for an education-related purpose? I suggest not. My hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam may take her son karting, but—although it may be enjoyable—that is not really educational.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend suggesting that a karting centre would not be covered by the Bill? If so, I find that extremely worrying.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly suggesting that but it is for the Bill's promoter to give a definitive answer. I can only give my view and that of the Government, but I thought that a karting centre would already be covered by a multitude of other provisions and protections and that it does not provide the type of activities with which the Bill is concerned. By giving such an example, my hon. Friend is taking us astray—too wide of the issue. We must remain focused on the Bill's intentions.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
If my hon. Friends re-examine clause 1(2) in its entirety, they should realise, as I do, that it is difficult to improve on that wording as a working definition of the type of activities that should be covered by the Bill. Clause 1(2) reasonably excludes certain areas and activities but is sufficiently wide to encompass all those that we want included.<br><br>
It may be that when we come to draft the regulations, the wording will have to be refined. The Bill provides scope for that, so we should have no fears that this is the last word on the subject—this is the first word. The clause sets out the broad area to be covered. The regulations will be more specific and, as was mentioned on Second Reading, they might specify exemptions. All in all, the original wording is as close as we are likely to get and will sufficiently encompass the reservations expressed. For those reasons, I oppose the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the contribution of the hon. Member for Beckenham, and his concern and interest. His amendments were well motivated.<br><br>
Amendment No. 21 wants to insert the word "educational" into the activities that could be covered. There is a danger of drawing the remit of the legislation too wide. The term "educational", when specifically written into a clause of a Bill is quite different from a Select Committee referring to activities that may have educational purposes. In years to come, lawyers will be kept busy interpreting the legislation in courts. An educational trip would not necessarily, by definition, be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
hazardous. For a trip that is generally for social and personal development but which has a general educational remit, we want to define hazardous activities within the trip and to make the law apply to them.<br><br>
I can tell the hon. Member for Beckenham that I seriously considered including the word "educational" but, after much agonising, I decided that it was better left out so, that the Bill's remit was not drawn too wide. There are centres that offer educational facilities, but none of which would be deemed as hazardous or posing any danger to children. I would not want the Bill to cover such centres and activities.<br><br>
Amendment No. 39 was tabled by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, but we found ourselves discussing an amendment that was not being moved. I am amazed at the hon. Lady's ingenuity in getting the Committee to debate her amendment, and I shall not cover that point.<br><br>
I should, however, address her concern about leadership and instruction and about whether someone could simply accompany a trip and therefore be deemed to be giving leadership or instruction. As the Minister pointed out, a school or parent would be extremely unwise to send children to a centre that was not accredited and where people just accompanied them on an activity. Are we to assume, however, that adults who accompany a party of children on an activity would really do so in a trappist capacity and maintain complete silence, giving no indication of where they were going or which equipment they were going to use? If they did not do that and said, "We are going to walk up this mountain" or "We are going to use this piece of equipment," they would have given some form of leadership and instruction. Even if they walked off in a certain direction, and the children followed them in a crocodile, they would have given leadership, and that would be covered by the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point about those activities. However, an unscrupulous operator might say, "No, that is not leadership. I am simply accompanying them." We should therefore be quite clear that there are no grey areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If a centre operated outside this provision, it would not be offering leadership or instruction. Any parent or teacher who sent a child to such a centre would be neglecting a duty to care for that child. On the other hand, if a centre was accredited under the terms of the Bill and came under the licensing scheme, it would have to show that the people who accompanied parties of children were competent in the activities that the children were to undertake.<br><br>
Representatives of such a centre would, therefore, be offering leadership and instruction and if they tried to offer activities in the trappist capacity that I described, even if the children just followed them in a crocodile, they would be committing an offence. There is no difficulty there: a centre would have to be of one kind or the other. Once a centre was accredited, it would be obliged under law to provide people who were competent in the various activities to take charge of the children.<br><br>
There is a problem with amendment No. 39, which takes out the leadership and instruction element. We have agonised over how to narrow the range of activities that are covered by the Bill. However, if we agreed to amendment No. 39, people hiring out boats on a boating lake or surfboards on a beach could be covered by the Bill
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0020">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
if they did not offer instruction or leadership, and simply hired out equipment. They would, of course, be obliged to make sure that that equipment was safe and fit for the purpose for which it was intended. However, they should not necessarily come within the scope of the Bill.<br><br>
If we take out the leadership and instruction element, the Bill will be so wide-ranging and will cover so many activities that many of the concerns mentioned by the hon. Member for Dorset, West would then come into play. Into which category would small groups offering sporting activities such as the scouts and the cubs fall? There must be hundreds of thousands—perhaps millions—of such organisations, and I am certain that hon. Members would not want to place this legal framework around those activities.<br><br>
The Minister wondered whether the Bill would apply to a school—a useful point. The Bill is necessary because teachers and governors currently allow 75 per cent. of children to go to activity centres while individual parents look through the glossy brochures and send their children to the centres. Because there is a detachment between the person who is making the decision to send children and the centre itself, it is difficult for the decision makers to know whether the centre is competent and operating to proper safety standards.<br><br>
We had strong representations from governors on the matter. They said that if the four-point plan that the former Secretary of State brought forward in November 1993 was fully implemented, governors of individual schools would have responsibility for deciding whether an activity centre 100 or 200 miles away was safe in every particular. If we gave them that responsibility and the Bill did not exist, those activities would cease forthwith, because governors would not be able to assume that responsibility.<br><br>
Activities that are contained within a school would not be in the Bill's scope because school teachers and governors are, properly, acting in loco parentis and have absolute control within the school's near confines. Therefore, there is no need for the Bill to cover such activities. I am attracted by amendment No. 21, to insert the word "educational", but I fear that if we did so, we would be in danger of drawing the Bill too widely. I fully understand the hon. Gentleman's feelings about the inclusion of that word, but there are dangers. The existing wording
<br><blockquote><p>"sporting, recreational or outdoor activities"</p></blockquote>
satisfactorily covers our intention. I recommend that the Committee does not accept the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Merchant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened to that useful debate with great interest. I was particularly pleased to hear the remarks of the hon. Member for Devonport; he addressed many of my concerns and was generous to acknowledge that the word "educational" was worth considering. He said that he had flirted with the idea, and that gives me some confidence. I feel that the matter has been closely examined, and that the hon. Gentleman has spent much more time than I in weighing up and considering the impact of every word in the Bill.<br><br>
Members of the Committee know principally what we are talking about when we refer to outdoor activity centres, but making sure that there is an adequate definition in law is a different challenge. We know what we mean, but I do not know that we all agree on exactly
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
where the margins fall—what we want in the Bill and what we want left out. I suspect that there might be some differences between us.<br><br>
The Bill is principally concerned with the margins of the issue. A majority of outdoor activity operators have high standards and are perfectly trustworthy. Although the law will apply to them in future, they manage well without it. We are not concerned about them. As always, the law is concerned with the minority of bad operators, whom we cannot trust to operate sensibly on their own initiative. That is why we need precise definitions. The hon. Member for Yardley was correct in saying that teachers exercise good judgment and are not stupid.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Yardley was correct to say that teachers exercise good judgment and are not stupid. The vast majority of teachers have always exercised precise, good and all-encompassing judgment on such matters, but the law exists to protect people—in this case children—against the odd person who may not exercise good judgment, who may make a mistake and, in a moment of indecision and bad judgment, an error.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
One teacher among the many thousands who are totally trustworthy may not have the clarity to make the right decision and may, either through bad briefing or not understanding the subject as thoroughly as he should, send children on an orienteering or mountain walking exercise that, for one reason or another, falls outside the scope of the Bill and thus put the children at risk.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right to say that some teachers may not follow the guidelines, but is not he reassured by the procedure for school trips that is now in place? A teacher cannot say, "Let's go on a trip. I'll choose the instructor and the place. I'll do everything." Teachers have to apply to the head, get the proposal signed by the board of governors and obtain parental permission. The hon. Gentleman described a scenario in which people in a responsible position with care of children make the wrong decision. He should be reassured by the procedure that has to be carried out by law before any trip can take place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Merchant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We all know that systems sometimes fail, however well drawn up they are. We should ensure that the law underwrites the procedures and provides safeguards. I do not disagree with the hon. Lady in principle: what she says is logical and correct. I am simply trying to ensure that the law covers all eventualities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Section 7(a) of the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 does precisely that. It gives people a general duty of care to look after not only employees while at work, but other people affected by their acts. The Bill deals with the special circumstances in which the tragedy at the centre in Lyme bay occurred. It covers a clearly defined group of organisations. The hon. Gentleman's fears should be addressed in the context of the 1974 Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Merchant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee. I have only three more important points to which I want briefly to refer. Before I do so, I must say that the hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0021">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
Gentleman answered his own point. He said that the HSE covers these areas and then said that the Bill is necessary to cover these specific circumstances, which is precisely my point. The Bill extends and emphasises existing law, and we should ensure that it does so effectively and properly.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Minister admitted that the definition was important and then said that, at present, it is only a working definition and we might have to reconsider it later. I am worried about legislation that has only a working definition. That is why I want to consider this matter in more detail.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help to clarify what I meant by what I said all that time ago. These words provide the framework, but we may want to introduce regulations later that give a more precise definition of coverage or introduce specific exemptions. I do not envisage reconsidering those words because I am broadly satisfied with them, but I admit that, when the Bill is on the statute book and after consultations, we may introduce regulations that give further clarification and specify exemptions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Merchant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend, as always, is incisive and reassuring. I am grateful for his remarks, which give me the confidence to feel that the worries expressed by other and myself can continue to be examined and addressed in practical terms.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Devonport suggested that inserting the word "educational" would automatically make the Bill apply to every educational establishment. However, the three words "sporting, recreational or outdoor"—four words if "educational" were included— are limited by the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"as may be prescribed by regulations".</p></blockquote>
I was relying on that to prevent the word "educational" being too widely applied.<br><br>
My amendments sought to introduce a means of defining activities, but that was not dealt with thoroughly in the debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam referred to karting as an example of a fringe activity that might or might not be covered by the Bill. She was right to draw our attention to that problem. I do not accept that existing regulations elsewhere constitute sufficient protection.<br><br>
Having said that, the debate has taken on board the concerns that underpinned my amendments. I was reassured by my hon. Friend the Minister and the hon. Member for Devonport. It it clear that the hon. Gentleman and myself are of one mind as to the purpose of this clause and of the Bill more widely. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. I wish to make it clear that I do not want to persist with my amendment. I am not sure whether it has been grouped with others or treated separately. If the latter, I want to withdraw it and make appropriate comments as to why.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sadly, the hon. Lady's amendment has gone.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
<p>Further consideration adjourned.—<i>[Mr. Jamieson.]</i></p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That during the remaining proceedings on the Activity Centres (Young Persons' Safety) Bill the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.—<i>[Mr. Jamieson.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That motion comes as a surprise to the Committee, and a debate would be appropriate. If members of the Committee want to initiate a debate, I would be happy to oblige.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The motion can be debated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would help to know the reasoning behind the motion. In my experience, it is traditional for Committees to meet on Wednesday mornings and, provided that reasonable progress has been made, that is usually regarded as adequate. Most Committee members will already have arranged their affairs and diaries accordingly. Suggesting at this stage that the Committee should move into afternoon sittings or beyond seems unnecessary and inappropriate. I remain to be persuaded that we need to consider afternoon sittings as early as next week.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I totally endorse the Minister's remarks. I had not anticipated that we would sit on Wednesday afternoons; the Education Select Committee sits then and it would conflict with my other duties. I think that we all understood when we joined the Committee that it would be a Wednesday morning responsibility, which I am very happy to carry out; I have other responsibilities for the afternoon, however, and it would be inappropriate to insist that we sit then, particularly as that is not normal for Bills of this nature.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wolfson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the argument against afternoon sittings. I have a Northern Ireland Select Committee on Wednesdays and it would produce exactly the same conflict for me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Merchant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I endorse the comments of both my hon. Friends. I was under the impression that a sittings motion is normally put to a Standing Committee at the beginning of its sitting rather than suddenly slipped in at the end. I do not object in principle to afternoon sittings and I agree that they are desirable if a Bill is dragging on or appears to be taking longer than expected, but I do not imagine that that will be the case with this Bill.<br><br>
I feel that it is particularly unfair for the Committee to be asked at this stage to contemplate sitting next Wednesday afternoon. That is rather short notice and, although I appreciate that we must all arrange our other responsibilities around the requirements of the Committees we sit on, it would be much easier if we had more warning. I would have thought it more appropriate to make progress before deciding to include afternoon sittings. If necessary, we could look at that possibility next week or the week after that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lidington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I too support the arguments of my hon. Friends. There are particular reasons for doubting whether such a sittings motion is desirable or necessary at this point in our proceedings. We began to consider the amendments to clause 1 today and, as I pointed out
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0022">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
earlier, the Bill seeks to give extensive enabling powers to the Secretary of State of the day—in the main to the Secretary of State for Education, but the Secretaries of State for Employment and for Scotland would presumably also be included. Clause 1 contains the meat of those enabling powers and gives rise to the questions that I and my hon. Friends asked about the definitions that the promoter and the Government might have in mind with regard to the drafting and laying before Parliament of secondary legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is making a good case for sitting on both Wednesday morning and Wednesday afternoon, and I would like him to return to the reason why he does not want to meet in the afternoon.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lidington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Our lengthy debate should not lead members of the Committee into believing that swifter progress is impossible once we get beyond the meat of clause 1.1 would be prepared to support a sittings motion such as that proposed by the hon. Member for Devonport, if it were brought forward at the beginning of proceedings next Wednesday morning. However, I find it regrettable that a sittings motion should be tabled at the end of our proceedings rather than appear on the selection list in advance of our proceedings so that all hon. Members are aware of it. That would be an unfortunate precedent to set, on a Bill that has considerable cross-party support.</span></p>
