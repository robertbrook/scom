	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall consider new clause 2—	<i>circumstances in which discrimination is justified</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>'.—(1) For the purposes of section 12 above, a provider of goods, facilities or services is justified in discriminating against a disabled person only if—
	<ol>
	<li>in his opinion, one or more of the conditions mentioned in subsection (2) are satisfied; and</li>
	<li>it is reasonable, in all the circumstances of the case, for him to hold that opinion.</li>
</ol>
	<ol>
	<li>The conditions are that—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>in any case—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>the discrimination is necessary in order not to endanger the health or safety of any person (which may include that of the disabled person); or</li>
	<li>the disabled person is incapable of entering into an enforceable agreement, or of giving an informed consent, and for that reason the discrimination is reasonable in that case;</li></ol>
	<li>in a case falling within section 12(2)(a), the discrimination is necessary in order for the provider of goods, facilities or services to be able to provide the goods, facility or service to other members of the public;</li>
	<li>in a case falling within section 12(2)(b),(c), (cc), (d), (e) or (f), the discrimination is reasonably necessary in order for the provider of goods, facilities or services to be able to provide the goods, facility or service to the disabled person or to other members of the public;</li>
	<li>in a case falling within section 12(2)(cc), the difference in the terms on which the goods, facility or service is provided to the disabled person and those on which it is provided to other members of the public reflects the greater cost to the provider of goods, facilities or services in providing it to the disabled person.</li></ol>
	<li>Regulations may make provision as to other circumstances in which, for the purposes of section 12, a provider of services of a prescribed description (for example, insurance services) is to be taken to be justified in treating a disabled person less favourably than he treats, or would treat, other members of the public.'.</li>
</ol></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Social Security and Disabled People (Mr. William Hague)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the length of time the Committee has spent debating clause 12 I do not intend to raise many points about it now. We have discussed a large number of amendments and I should like to refer briefly to new clause 2 and my belief that any anti-discrimination measure would need such a clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 2 would help us to face reality and admit that there will be a few occasions when a service provider would be justified in treating a disabled person less favourably than he would any other member of the public. Those instances will be rare and the tests which service
	<span class='label label-info column'>238</span>
providers would have to pass successfully for new clause 2 to be evoked as a defence are severe. But the clause is none the less vital to the success of the legislation and we would be misguided if we thought that the Bill could do without a clause of this nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's advocates may argue that all is taken care of by the Bill's definition of a "qualified disabled person". We have debated that at considerable length and so I shall not go over it again. A "qualified disabled person" would have to meet
	<br><blockquote><p>"the essential requirements for the provision of goods, facilities and services".</p></blockquote>
There is some notion of justified discrimination within that. A person who did not meet the essential requirements would presumably not be a "qualified disabled person". We cannot necessarily have confidence that the courts would interpret that formula in the manner intended. No doubt the proposed commission would issue a code of practice to clarify matters. But even assuming it produces a clear code which meets with wide acclaim, what happens if a court decides that the words in the Bill mean something else? Courts have been known to take surprising decisions—they certainly surprise policy makers from time to time—and successive Governments over the years have had to ask Parliament to pass amending regulations made necessary because of an unexpected court decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings us to the problem that I have often referred to in our debates—the absence of regulation-making powers. Since I announced the Government's proposals to the House in November I have continually emphasised how important it is to maintain the credibility of the legislation in the eyes of those employers and service providers who will be asked to implement it. If the aspirations of disabled people, shared by all of us in this Room, for full participation in society are to be met, it is vital that the reasonable limitations on what can and should be required of business are recognised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A clause such as new clause 2 is necessary. I have spoken about it on many other occasions during our debates and so I shall not move it formally when we come to that point in our proceedings. I should like to ask questions about one subject covered by clause 12 that we have not considered during our debates on the amendments. Clause 12(1) uses the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in relation to goods, facilities or services".</p></blockquote>
That is presumably distinct from saying in relation to the provision of goods, facilities and services which is the alternative formula.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should it be assumed from that wording that the manufacture of goods is covered as well as their sale or delivery? The provision of goods, facilities and services seems to mean their sale or delivery, but the proposal refers to goods, facilities and services, not just to their provision. Does the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes) intend the measure to cover the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>239</span>
manufacture of goods and if so, to what extent? Would instructions have to be in an accessible format or on a particular kind of packaging? Would design features of manufactured products—buttons, switches, displays, dials and so on—have to be accessible? If that is so, how does the hon. Gentleman propose to deal with manufactured goods made in other countries but sold in British shops? Would they be able to stock foreign goods that failed to comply with the requirements of the clause? If not, how would that square with international agreements on free trade and competitiveness? We had to consider that tricky issue in our debate on the Disability Discrimination Bill and I would welcome comments on the matter and clarification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is putting questions to my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East. May I ask the Minister a question about the new clause? Subsection (2)(a)(ii) states that the conditions are that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the disabled person is incapable of entering into an enforceable agreement, or of giving an informed consent, and for that reason the discrimination is reasonable in that case"?</p></blockquote>
What is the Government's approach to advocacy? If it even enters their thinking, when do they intend to implement the sections of the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986 which would make sense of that subsection of the new clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This debate is not about advocacy, although the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) has long advocated the cause, and I respect that. New clause 2(2) mirrors one of the clauses that the hon. Gentleman and I debated during proceedings on the Disability Discrimination Bill and the issue will no doubt be debated in the other place. It is intended to be used on only a few occasions. We are trying to protect service providers when someone may be incapable of entering an enforceable agreement. We must recognise that such occasions exist; that is what new clause 2(2) is about. I shall not press the new clause. I have made my point and I shall be interested to hear hon. Member's comments about manufacturing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester, Wythenshawe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he was not concerned with matters raised by my hon. Friend, the author of the 1986 Act. He is, however, as he said, concerned about enforceability. The official journal of the Australian Quadriplegic Association refers in an editorial to the unanimous decision in the Australian High Court in the Brandy case that the provisions in the legislation are not enforceable. To the lay reader those provisions look quite strong. That case emphasises the need for us to look again and again, and ever more carefully, at our provisions to combat discrimination to ensure that the legislation is enforceable. An advisory council does not pretend to be able to enforce legislation; it is not for that purpose. We should look carefully across national frontiers. If anything we should not drop the Disability Rights Commission, but make it even stronger that it is at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>240</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister correctly judged what my arguments would be on new clause 2. The word "qualified" in the Bill covers the concerns expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister asked about clause 12(1). It applies to access to goods, facilities and services and to their sale as distinct from their manufacture. Manufacturing provisions would be covered by elements of the Bill that we have already discussed on employment circumstances and the conditions in which people should have access to employment. This clause is about access to goods and services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful for that clarification of the meaning of clause 12. It would have been better to say that the clause related to the provision of goods, facilities and services, but we can return to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not clear as to how the clauses on employment deal with manufactured goods. Clearly, they deal with employment in the manufacturing sector and elsewhere, but my question was about manufactured goods. I cannot recall anything in clause 4 or elsewhere about manufactured goods. I take it from that that the Bill does not relate to them. If clause 12 is not about manufactured goods, and clause 4 certainly is not, they do not appear to be covered by the Bill. That may be the most sensible position to take, but it should be made clear whether that is so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Part IV is headed "Provision of Goods, Facilities and Services". Therefore, the circumstances in which goods are manufactured are covered by the provisions on employment. The Minister may have pointed out a gap in the Bill, so I shall consider amending it at future stages in order to fill that gap.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>TELECOMMUNICATIONS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to detain the Committee for long. In the long list of examples to which part IV applies, the Bill includes facilities for telecommunications or other mechanical, electrical or electronic forms of communication. My point is similar to the one that I raised during the debate on clause, 12. In the context of manufacturing, what is meant when we refer to "such other forms of communication"? Does it mean that design modifications of telecommunications and other equipment would be covered by the clause? How would we guard against that impeding the development of new products?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To hamper the development of new products would benefit no one. For example, Microsoft has recently faced criticism of its Windows computer operating system
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0226">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>241</span>
because people with impaired vision found that system more difficult to use even though the great majority of people found it much easier to use. If Microsoft had been prevented from introducing Windows, the majority of people would have lost out. As a result of the product's success, Microsoft has been able to invest in developing a new version which promises to be far more accessible to visually impaired people, so everyone has gained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a court were to decide on the basis of the clause that the manufacture of electronic equipment—electrical and electronic forms of communication—was covered, would a disabled person be able to accuse a designer of discrimination for not designing equipment in a way that would enable all disabled people to use it. Would it be right to force a manufacturer to produce a certain type of product when such a range was already provided by a competitor? Surely it is for manufacturers to decide which business they are in. Whatever method of enforcement was finally devised would be bound to be terribly complex. I am anxious to know how the clause deals with those points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder also why it is necessary to make a requirement for all newly manufactured telephone apparatus to be hearing-aid compatible. Why should new developments in telephone manufacture be wholly dependent on developments in an unrelated area such as hearing aids? Again, there is a potentially limiting effect on new telephone technology in this country. Surely the important matter is that products such as hearing-aid compatible telephone apparatus are available rather than that all apparatus is hearing-aid compatible. Those are my reservations about the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been put to me by John Hart of Hearing Concern—the British Association for the Hard of Hearing—that provisions relating to developments may need to be written into the clause. He writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Bill as written seeks to amend the 1984 Telecommunications Act, but many telephones that could be used by hearing-impaired people are not covered by the Act, which deals only with telephones connected to the public network. Also, some of the phones connected to the public network are covered by a different regulation, namely The Branch Systems General Licence. This deals with emergency telephones in lifts and requires them to be adapted by the addition of inductive couplers so that they can be used for hearing aid wearers. It also requires the display of notices saying how the phones can be used with hearing aids."</p></blockquote>
John Hart makes other points about the clause which indicate that although it has benefits for people with hearing disabilities, it may not cover the range of possibilities. This is something to which I wish to return later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The points made by the Minister about the clause having limiting effects on telephone development technology are countered by arguments to the effect that design modifications that take account of the problems of those with hearing difficulties are not necessarily developments that hinder technology. In fact, it could be argued that they
	<span class='label label-info column'>242</span>
assist it. There is likely to be a technological spin-off from the use of phones and telecommunications provisions to ensure that people with hearing difficulties are catered for in that that may help those who do not have such difficulties. I am not as worried as the Minister about the impact of the provisions on the development of telecommunications. I want the clause to stand and I want to take into account the points made by Hearing Concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all have a common purpose, but the promoter of the Bill needs to take more advice on whether the insertion of subsection (7A) might freeze technology. If, for example, new telephone systems—which would presumably include mobile telephones and the telephones in offices and factories as well as those that would be available to ordinary domestic purchasers—must conform to the technology currently used in hearing aids, what would happen if a new hearing aid was developed that would be compatible with a different technological system? Would the new system on the telephone be banned from production because the old system of hearing aids blocked the availability of new technology?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strongest argument is that telephones that are available to the public or to employees should, perhaps with limited exceptions, be in line with what people with hearing aids are likely to be able to use. We do not know whether the induction loop is the only system that will ever be available and I think that the promoter and sponsors should therefore reconsider the clause. I shall not vote against it, because I am not sure that the issue is practical or relevant if the Bill is not to become an Act this Session, but advice should be sought on what is practical and what would bring benefits not only at present but in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's bias is towards what hearing-impaired people are telling him. He has quoted John Hart, than whom one would go far to find a more distinguished authority on what hearing-impaired people seek from the legislation. If my hon. Friend has a fault it is that he has bent over backwards to take account of people who, day by day, week by week and year by year, live with what they feel to be severe discrimination against them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Technology is not run by referendum. It is advanced when one person has an idea and tries it out and, if it is successful, others want to copy it. Proposed subsection (7A) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A designation under this section which relates to telephones shall specify that any newly manufactured apparatus be designed to provide for effective use with hearing aids that are designed to be compatible with telephones."</p></blockquote>
If I were to come along, with Bottomley Enterprises, perhaps having taken advice from those who are hearing impaired, and present a new system for a hearing aid that had not yet been manufactured and a new system for a telephone which could not be manufactured because compatible hearing aids did not yet exist, I should find that technology had been frozen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>243</span>
If there is one thing that we in the House have learnt—especially where the media, of which the telephone is only one example, are concerned—it is that technology overtakes legislation. That has happened with television systems, for example. We should be extremely careful about freezing technology, because those who gain most through advances in technology are those with disabilities to overcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fairness to John Hart, I should point out that few people know more than he knows about technological developments. He is a Post Office engineer who has spent much of his life—as did Bell, the originator of the telephone—trying to help those who are hearing-impaired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is clearly well intentioned and I do not regard him as a hostile participant in the debate, but he should realise that John Hart is well tutored in technological matters and especially in current developments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not have much time and I do not want to speak about John Hart, whom I have not met. I am sure that I would admire him as the right hon. Gentleman does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me make an analogy. Suppose all hearing aids were geared to take signals from analogue telephone systems and someone said that there would be long-term benefits for everyone—if not immediately for the hearing-impaired—if we moved to digital transmission. The new subsection would ban the development of digital telephone services, as hearing aids are geared to the analog system. I am sure that that is not intended, but the new subsection would have such an effect. I shall not vote against the clause, but the drafting does not achieve the aims of John Hart or my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) has identified the problem. He has given an example of the difficulties that the clause could cause. We share the intentions that the right hon. Member for Manchester, Wythenshawe (Mr. Morris) outlined; that is why we included references to forms of communication in the Government's disability discrimination measure. We do not disagree about aims, but good intentions are not enough. We have to get it right. We must ensure that there are no unintended side effects. My hon. Friend and I have given examples of such side effects that could arise. I welcome the intention to reconsider the clause. I hope that that will take account of our points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 59, in page 10, line 18, at end insert—
	<span class='label label-info column'>244</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1B) Nothing in section 12 makes it unlawful for a provider of goods, facilities or services to fail to take any steps which would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods, facilities or service in question or the nature of his trade, profession or business.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 60, in page 10, line 18, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1C) Nothing in section 12 makes it unlawful for a provider of goods, facilities or services to fail to take any steps which would cause him to incur expenditure exceeding the prescribed maximum.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(1D) Regulations under subsection (1C) may provide for the prescribed maximum to be calculated by reference to—

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would protect service providers from being obliged to make changes that would alter the fundamental nature of their business. The Bill provides that a service provider must not discriminate against disabled people by failing to make reasonable modifications to rules, policies or practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 12(2)(e) obliges a service provider to remove architectural, communication and transport barriers when such modifications will not impose undue hardship on the business. Under Clause 12(2)(f), the service provider has a duty to supply auxiliary aids and services when that will not impose undue hardship on the business. The Committee knows my objections to a test of undue hardship, and also that I support the intention of the provisions. The Government's disability discrimination measure contains parallel provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The test of undue hardship must be considered with the provisions of clause 14(1), which contains the Bill's criteria for determining the reasonableness of any modification. The test does not refer to the effect of a modification on the nature of the service. Therefore, the Bill may require a service provider to make changes that would fundamentally alter the business. That could lead to ludicrous circumstances in which, for example, the proprietor of a nightclub would be required by law to increase the level of lighting to meet the needs of a visually impaired person. We agree that a proprietor of a nightclub should not be allowed blatantly to refuse entry to a disabled person. But a requirement to turn up the lights would change a fundamental feature of the business and would spoil the enjoyment of other customers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the problems of nightclubs, with which members of the Committee may be familiar, is that their noise is turned up so much that those who are not already aurally impaired become so impaired. Is the Minister satisfied that sufficient controls exist to prevent hearing-threatening amplification from loudspeakers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would require a different measure.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0228">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>245</span>
From my limited experience of nightclubs around the nation, I sympathise with my hon. Friend's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The circumstances that I described would be unacceptable. They would not arise often, but the Bill contains nothing to prevent them. Service providers would not regard the Bill as credible if it were to demand from them that they change the essential nature of their facility or service. The support of those providers will be crucial in ensuring that the legislation works.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a fascinating point. I cannot recall receiving any representations from blind people who want lights turned up in nightclubs or from nightclub owners who are worried about blind people wanting the lights turned up. Is that a problem at Conservative party conferences or Young Conservative gatherings? I have to admit that it is a new one on me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our job is to anticipate problems and solutions, not merely to repeat what we have heard. The omission of such a provision from the Bill is all the more surprising given its inclusion in the Americans with Disabilities Act. Since the drafters of the Bill have, in many ways, taken the Act as a model, I wonder whether the omission is deliberate or accidental, and whether there is some reason why hon. Members sponsoring the Bill have decided to omit a provision of that kind. I hope that it is not another example of a code of practice from a commission, which would not be enforceable in the courts, being meant to save the day. Amendment No. 59 would deal with that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 60 introduces a subject familiar to those of us who discussed the Disability Discrimination Bill. It would introduce the power to set a financial limit on the level of expenditure required to comply with the right of access. The power to set a financial limit on the cost of meeting one's duties under the legislation is essential if businesses and service providers are to have confidence in the Bill. Service providers will reap the rewards of better access through increased custom, and when the Disability Discrimination Bill becomes law, we must all join in persuading them of that. Nevertheless, it is important for service providers to know that there is a limit, within any given time period, on the expenditure in which they are likely to be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It my be claimed that the concept of undue hardship is a sufficient safeguard for traders' interests, but I am not persuaded that it would be or that service providers would be convinced that it would be. The ability to set a financial cap, as set out in amendment No. 60, would give a certainty to business that a phrase such as "undue hardship" cannot provide. In previous sittings I gave examples from the United States of firms which appear to have been driven out of business because of the enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the uncertain concept of undue hardship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would incorporate an ability to set a financial limit, in the same way as in the Disability
	<span class='label label-info column'>246</span>
Discrimination Bill. That could be calculated by reference to a variety of situations. It could encompass aggregate amounts of expenditure incurred in different cases, so that a service provider could consult a local access officer, plan a series of improvements to access over a period of time and be reassured that just because elements of that plan did not come up to the financial limit, he would not be required to make further alterations. We must account for the wide variety of modifications that might be considered; for example, installing a ramp, widening doors or removing obstructions from corridors or shopping isles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision would be a fair way of ensuring that the service provider who sensibly planned ahead would not run the risk of having greater liabilities than the service provider who chose to delay taking any action until forced to do so by the threat of legal action. For similar reasons, it could also cope with different periods. The provision might also be a way of allowing a service provider to make an earlier start to improvements without necessarily waiting for a particular date when the provisions became operative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is our plan in phasing in the Disability Discrimination Bill to set out clearly what will be a service provider's obligations and then to allow time for him or her to incorporate those in, for example, planned schedules of refurbishment of premises. One of the clearest messages that I brought back from my studies of what is happening in the United States is that service providers and employers can be persuaded overwhelmingly to support antidiscrimination measures for disabled people and will be prepared to make adjustments, but they need to know what will be required of them and to know that the costs will not be unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision can also cope with the problem of different services, thereby allowing traders in certain types of business to be treated differently from others. Following consultation on the Government Bill, it became clear that it would be inequitable for a provider of a computer support service for, for example, who may have no premises open to the public, to be under the same obligations as a major chain of high street retailers. The proposal would allow us to cope with the problem of different premises and would allow peripatetic services to be treated so as to ensure that they would know their obligations to be reasonable, taking account of the fact that they operated from different premises at different times. It could also allow for expenditure incurred by one provider of services to be treated as incurred by another. The provision could apply to expenditure by a previous tenant of a shop who would ensure that the premises were accessible. It would be important for a new tenant to know what obligations he or she would continue to face—for example, subcontractors of franchisees. It would ensure that a person who rented out stalls in an indoor market could take the necessary steps to ensure that the premises met the requirements of the legislation. An individual stallholder could thus have confidence that no further physical alteration to the premises would be required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The flexible approach that I propose could deal with such situations; the Bill as drafted offers nothing to help service providers understand their obligations other than
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0229">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>247</span>
the woolly notion of reasonableness in clause 14(1), with no reliable, legally binding mechanism to provide a clearer picture in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly agree with my hon. Friend about the critical importance of the providers of services and others involved, including disabled people, being as aware as possible of the obligations and the rights in certain situations. My hon. Friend is making a strong case for a Disability Rights Commission. Does he acknowledge that that key provision meets the objections that he describes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that it meets the objections. I know of no evidence that such a commission would be willing or able to set a financial limit of the kind that I propose. I expect that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East will say that a commission would draw up codes of practice to deal with many of the situations that I describe. My point is that such codes of practice would not be legally enforceable and that they would not have to be drawn up until after the measure had come into force. That would not necessarily resolve the problem. The experience of the ADA shows the importance of businesses knowing exactly what the law requires of them. The Bill as drafted does not offer such certainty. The amendments would ensure that the Bill provides that certainty, and I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the Minister did not move amendments Nos. 57 and 58. Amendment No. 57 tackled the matter of undue hardship; presumably he did not move it because the Committee had already debated the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a sense in which the amendments meant that the undue hardship criteria were replaced by the provision to ensure that any expenditure incurred would not go beyond prescribed limits. The removal of one amendment and its replacement by others showed the Minister's different approach. The undue hardship debate and the principles upheld in the Committee should be taken into account so that the courts can make reasonable judgments. The other provision does not have the urgency required because the clause covers the point. As the Minister pointed out, the commission could play a fruitful role and that would feed into other investigations taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 59 is on the fundamental alteration of goods, facilities and services, but that concept is implied in the Bill. The Minister may want to say a little more about the word "fundamental" and what he envisages by that, but it may not be necessary to include items that are already covered elsewhere. That may lead to the avoidance of doubt. If the Minister says a little more about the scope of the amendment No. 59 I shall not necessarily seek to block it. However, amendment No. 60 runs counter to the general principles of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know what I am trying to achieve. I wish to build a provision into the Bill rather than to bolt it on later. I agree that a degree of urgency is needed. Too many people have been excluded from
	<span class='label label-info column'>248</span>
activities in which they wish to take part because there has not been a sense of urgency. We should aim to start making further progress now, while recognising what has been achieved in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The greatest change will come from a change of culture. Instead of people having to argue whether they should be required to do something or whether the measures can be afforded, it should be regarded as an obligation of community, citizenship and enterprise not to exclude people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember going to a department store in Belfast that had undergone massive renovation as a result of public grants. The owners thought that I was being unfair when I pointed out that the menswear department was in the basement, with no access for anyone in a wheelchair. I then considered that example in the light of clause 14(1), which states that the factors in determining whether something
	<br><blockquote><p>"could be undertaken without undue hardship shall include—</p></blockquote>
	<ol>
	<li>the nature and cost of the actions in question;</li>
	<li>the overall financial resources …</li>
	<li>the availability of grants from public funds".</li></ol>
I wondered whether the department store in Belfast, which has now closed, could have been required to ensure that half its potential customers in wheelchairs would have access to the suits rather than having one or two samples brought to them on the ground floor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the provisions in the clause, with or without amendments, would work. Are they justiciable? Are there any other examples in this country where the questions of undue hardship and the availability of grants have been tested?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 59 raises interesting issues, but it is not the key. I hope that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East will consider amendment No. 60, which is even more interesting. I do not know the answers to the problems that arise. We cannot expect outside providers to tell us what they regard as reasonable, but we should ask major providers to commit themselves to a programme that will produce achievements in the forseeable future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
London Underground is one example. If people argue that we should not build accessible platforms now because most of the existing platforms are inaccessible, we shall never have an underground system that is accessible. However, if we say that London Underground must have a programme to make all platforms accessible within the next five years, the system will get worse because all the money will go into modifying the platforms. Even then, the stated aim will not be achieved. One ought to have discussions with major providers to find practical ways forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the best way to pursue disability awareness in the context of clause 14 is to ensure that people know about the examples of best practice in Britain? For instance, shop mobility in Redditch is a wonderful opportunity for people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0230">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>249</span>
to see that my hon. Friend's objectives work. In addition, shop mobility means that far more money is spent because the partners and friends of disabled people also go there. It is a total success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I completely agree. The hon. Gentleman has put the point that I am trying to make better than I can. There is an important role for law: as I said at the beginning of the Committee stage, the Government and Parliament will always find ways of going further than was thought achievable the year before or five or 10 years before. That is the nature of advance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me is that too often organisations such as the Commission for Racial Equality and the Equal Opportunities Commission achieve prominence for their battles in court or at tribunals rather than for a general change in attitude which is the underlying driving force and the persistent permanent force for achievement. We need a mixture. The reason for our occasional disagreements on the Bill is to do with the rate of change at the margin. But we all agree with the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) who said that good practice needs talking about so that other people see the advantages and join in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I and, I think, most members of the Committee agree that legislation can be used, and should be used successfully, to tackle these problems. It remains to be seen whether the Government will succeed in reassuring my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham. However, we intend to be successful in using legislation to achieve the sort of improvement of which my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Monklands, West, among others, have spoken. I believe that it would help us to do that if our proposals were included in the Bill. I am not surprised that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East does not want to accept amendment No. 60. I attach importance to it and it mirrors provisions in the Government's measure. I have made my point and I shall not press it further, although I might want to return to it later in the Bill's proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the hon. Gentleman's open mindedness about amendment No. 59. He asked me about the word "fundamentally". It is a word of which we all have a certain understanding. It is stronger in this context than saying simply, "would alter" or "would significantly alter". It would fundamentally alter the nature of goods, facilities and services—a change to a critical part of their provision. That is why the United States Congress was happy to include it in the Americans with Disabilities Act. For the avoidance of doubt, given that it seems to match the hon. Gentleman's intentions, I think that he should accept amendment No. 59. If he is prepared to do that, I shall not move amendment No. 60.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly accept amendment No. 59.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the informal understanding between the hon. Gentleman and I to complete our consideration of the Bill today is to bear fruit, we will have to cover quite a bit of ground in the next half hour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to be a bit clearer about what powers of exemption the Secretary of State would have under the clause. Is it intended that he could make a blanket exemption for all service providers for a specified period, or could he identify particular services or industries? I imagine that the latter option is intended, because some of the past references to this provision by the Bill's supporters suggest that in transport matters the Secretary of State might allow a longer period of exemption than in other areas. If so, how will we identify those areas, and according to what criteria? Furthermore, how could the Secretary of State accomplish all that, given that clause 38 stipulates that this part of the Bill must come into force within six months of the Bill's receiving Royal Assent? My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is very talented but I had not realised that his abilities were held in such high regard by Opposition Members. To identify all those exemptions and bring them into force within six months of the passage of the Bill would be to stretch the task.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend got that right? Surely clause 38 brings into being powers which the Secretary of State would have to introduce in regulations. I am not sure that my interpretation of that clause suggested that he had to have all the exemptions ready within six months of the passing of the Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may be right. The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East will no doubt put me right if that is not the intention of the Bill. I read it in that way. I am not trying to be awkward about it. If there is a plain explanation I should be most grateful to hear it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. Is it possible to have any quick advice from the people here in the Room to tell us what the normal interpretation is? Could you cast some light on this shortly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chairman's rule is never to cast light on anything except Standing Orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In any event, I do not wish to oppose the clause standing part of the Bill. It is the only defence available against over-hasty implementation. Mine are minor questions, but if the hon. Minister for Derbyshire, North-Eat responded to them I should be grateful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have always argued that their principal concern about the Bill is that it would be executed in too hasty a fashion. The provisions in the clause seek to prevent that. The work of the commission is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0231">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>251</span>
a dynamic force which helps to implement over time the general principles that are being established and turn them into reality. Likewise, it is not expected that everything, everywhere must be done overnight. This is a practical measure; nevertheless it is highly principled in pushing Governments towards its aims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is a check and a guide but is to be there for a specific period. It does not mean that the Secretary of State has power to ride roughshod over the principles in the Bill. It is an important clause but it is not intended to have a universal application for areas where exemptions could take place nor to be used in such a way that the specific period was so long that it defeated the object of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whatever the intention may be, I do not see that there is a limitation to the exemptions that the Secretary of State can make. It seems to be an unqualified power given to the Secretary of State. If I am wrong perhaps I could be put right. I should also remind the Committee of one of the most effective driving forces for improvement with which I worked: the statutory Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee— DIPTAC—which showed a way of getting pressure, innovation and spread of good practice, and provided ways of getting Members to propose legislation to Parliament where appropriate. My reading of clause 15 is that it allows the Secretary of State to go at any speed to any area that he wishes. It goes far further than the Bill's sponsor intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we are debating clause 15 stand part I hope that an agreement between the sponsor and the Minister will not mean that my hon. Friend will not move amendment No. 61 when we come to it because I regard it as an important amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The legal implications are as the hon. Member for Eltham has described them, but there are practical considerations. The Secretary of State's role in these matters will not be aloof legalistic consideration; it will be determined by practical politics. Those politics will show that he must not give masses of areas exemptions for a host of periods because organisations of and for the disabled and those who support them will not wear it. In addition, a commission will produce codes of practice and reports which also will help to shape the Minister's attitudes and determine his horizons. It may be difficult to use any other legal wording but when we take legality and practicalities into account we must go down this road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The main thrust of the Minister's argument was that in the absence of his amendment the Government might be accused of being over hasty. Has the hon. Gentleman or my hon. Friend any experience of the Government ever being accused of being over hasty in any sense on disability matters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They might operate in certain ways to defeat the principles of the legislation because they have an entirely different approach. There lies the danger of the practicality in politics approach. We are moving through the Bill in such a way that old arguments and battles have
	<span class='label label-info column'>252</span>
been dropped and the Committee favours the principle of the Bill. The bits of amendments that we can fully and properly discuss are within the framework of that principle but the practicalities of operation are causing the problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Monklands, West tempts me to speak again. If I had copies of 	<i>Hansard</i> of Committee sittings on the Disability Discrimination Bill I could point to a substantial speech from the hon. Gentleman in which he said that the Government had been over hasty in producing the White Paper, the statement and the Bill in November and December last year, and in January this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister wishes to continue to proceed at the pace that he has set he must not be so provocative. I asked my hon. Friend—and I am now asking the Minister—whether there was ever a shred of evidence that the Government have ever been over hasty in implementing any measure relating to disability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That seemed to be the point of the hon. Gentleman's speech when he asked for more time to debate the Disability Discrimination Bill. Let us move on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I warn both Front Benches that someone else may be provoked into making speeches on matters in the Bill that he cares about if this exchange continues for much longer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I undertake not to start any such exchanges, but, if started, I shall respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seem to be left with a worry about the timing of the regulations that would be made under clause 15. My hon. Friend may be right in that my initial assumption was incorrect, but there is still a problem because part IV would come into force before exemptions were made—six months after the Bill received Royal Assent. There would then be a period when there were no exemptions, and legal actions could be commenced against people who would subsequently be exempted. A problem still exists and further thought is required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The intention was always that the Bill would apply to Northern Ireland and the fact that the word "Britain" crept in twice was a drafting error. However, amendment No. 95 is another matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is interesting. I entirely accept the hon. Gentlemen's intention to accept amendments Nos. 61 and 65 as correcting drafting errors, and that matter ends there. However, there are only two ways to make the Bill apply to Northern Ireland. One is to take the power to make the Order in Council as set out in amendment No. 95. The other way is the way that we adopted after amending the Disability Discrimination Bill. Schedule 6 to that Bill made all the necessary amendments directly to the relevant Northern Ireland legislation. That is quite unusual. The Bill's statement that it applies to Northern Ireland places it in conflict with much other Northern Ireland legislation. The hon. Gentleman and I have the same intentions in the matter, but all the advice on which I have based my approach to this and the Government legislation suggests that he would not achieve his objective if the Bill were passed without amendment No. 95. It might be interesting to see if my account is borne out by the experience in Northern Ireland of my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the amendments and the fact that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East accepts the amendments to replace the words "Great Britain" with the words "the United Kingdom". That is clearly in line with what is intended and it will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is right about amendment No. 95. It would be asking too much of the advisors to the sponsor to require a schedule equivalent to schedule 6 to the Disability Discrimination Bill, even if that were relevant or practical. It would be sensible to include the power to make provisions by Order in Council in so far as they may prove necessary with respect to other parts of the Bill. I am not sure that the Committee should spend too much time debating that point. It would bring the Bill into line with its intentions and with reality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 38, to which amendment 95 relates, states that
	<span class='label label-info column'>254</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"This Act extends to Northern Ireland"</p></blockquote>
so it has clearly been the intention all along that the United Kingdom is the entity to which the Bill applies, as it would be under amendments Nos. 61 and 65. I want to ensure that matters are constitutionally correct. Although it might go against custom and practice with regard to much Northern Ireland legislation to include on the face of the Bill a statement that it extends to Northern Ireland, it does not appear to me to debar the Bill from thus applying or therefore to require an Order in Council to achieve that. There is concern in Northern Ireland and among its politicians about the operation of the Order in Council procedure. Often there is a desire that legislation such as the Bill should apply to Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know of anything that prevents the measure from being applicable to Northern Ireland. I do not think that special adjustments need to be made in the Order in Council provision because differences might apply. If, however, I am wrong and there is a constitutional impediment, that would be a different consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that if there is no need to alter the legislation by Order in Council, it will not happen, because it would require work by Ministers and their advisers in the Northern Ireland Office and the equivalent Departments here. If, on the other hand, it turns out that the Bill will not work in Northern Ireland because of conflict or overlap or underlap, or because there is existing legislation in effect in Northern Ireland but not in Great Britain—or, for that matter, not in England and Wales,—the provision in amendment No. 95 will be essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rather than waiting for the lottery of a private Member's Bill or the Government's agreement on legislation to come forward, it is vital that the provision be in the Bill. There is no trick in what the Minister is providing. He is trying to help any provision to be applicable in Northern Ireland and, if the power to modify is necessary, the amendment will include it in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall oppose amendment No. 85, having listened to the debate. The Bill is sponsored by four hon. Members from Northern Ireland, including the late Sir James Kilfedder, from the four political parties that represented Northern Ireland at that time. There is a Bill in the House at present, sponsored by one of them, which applies to Northern Ireland and which is a replica of this Bill, with the words "Northern Ireland" added in the appropriate clauses. There is great commitment to the legislation among Northern Ireland politicians.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not the end of the Bill—hopefully it will go through other stages in the House. I will consider the matter in the future and discuss it with Northern Ireland politicians to find out what their feelings are and whether they see disadvantages or difficulties in not having the Order in Council provision added.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is as far as I will argue now—I shall take on board the Minister's position on the first two amendments because that would bring the Bill in line with our intention. I maintain the rest of our intention, which is to apply the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0233">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>255</span>
Bill straight to Northern Ireland. I realise that Northern Ireland and its legislation are not always straightforward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is not overstating the issue. On the contrary, I was reminded in a recent interview by Ulster Television that this was the first time in the history of parliamentary representation in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland that all 17 Members of Parliament from there were united in support of any piece of legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course all the Northern Ireland Members support anti-discrimination legislation and of course the hon. Member sponsoring the Bill intends it to apply to Northern Ireland. That is why he has said in clause 38 that it extends to Northern Ireland. The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham and me is that that does not make the Bill apply to Northern Ireland. The Bill does not apply to Northern Ireland, and any advice taken by the hon. Gentleman on the matter will confirm that. Two ways of applying the Bill are to have an Order in Council to make the necessary changes to Northern Ireland legislation or to have a schedule to the Bill. If the hon. Gentleman examines the schedule to the Disability Discrimination Bill, he will see that it is substantial, and it has been necessary to bring that Bill into force in Northern Ireland and to amend a great body of existing legislation in Northern Ireland. I welcome the hon. Gentleman's willingness to reconsider the matter. I think that he will find that he needs to adopt one or other of those routes. I welcome his acceptance of the other amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are liable to get stuck. I believe that if we want to give some time to discussing the new clauses, we need to get past clause 38 before they can be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both sides of the Committee may wish to reflect on the debate. The Bill may apply in Northern Ireland, if that is what the Bill states. The actual problem occurs when it may be in conflict with existing Northern Ireland legislation, which might be either United Kingdom legislation or Northern Ireland legislation. Also, it may be legislation that came before or after direct rule. We are covering such a wide field that all that we know for certain is that there is Northern Ireland legislation and that parts of the United Kingdom legislation do not apply to Northern Ireland. The Bill would add on to either, both or neither, in certain circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anybody who believes that amendment No. 95 wrecks the Bill is wrong. Without amendment, any glitches that may appear over conflict, overlap or underlap with existing legislation in Northern Ireland may mean waiting, possibly for years, before the intention of the Bill applies in full in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want to waste time on Divisions. If we reach amendment No. 95 while I am still here, I shall not push it to a vote. But I argue strongly that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East should not be suspicious. The Minister's proposals are helpful. If those proposals are not
	<span class='label label-info column'>256</span>
in the Bill and the Bill becomes an Act, I suspect that the hon. Gentleman and his supporters will say, "I wish that we had accepted the Minister's advice, at least on this occasion."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It should be clear to anyone that I am interested in Northern Ireland issues and will therefore pursue carefully the arguments presented today and consider whether there should be changes either in terms of schedules or in terms of the Minister's suggestions. In the meantime, I hope that the matter will not be pushed to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 19 deals with new constructions. Subsection (1) states:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0234">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>257</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"A failure to design and construct new buildings, extensions and material alterations in such a manner that they are readily accessible to … disabled people shall constitute unlawful discrimination, except where … it would be structurally impracticable so to do."</p></blockquote>
Is it the intention that all new dwellings should be accessible or, in the case of a housing development, only a percentage? Would a single dwelling constructed by an individual to his or her own specifications have to be accessible, whether he or she wished it or not?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the hon. Gentleman happy that "structurally impracticable" is the right test of reasonableness? It seems to be a stricter test than the undue hardship provisions that we debated earlier. Something that fell short of being structurally impracticable could nevertheless cause undue hardship, so the clause may not be consistent with the rest of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask one question and make one suggestion? Where do the words of clause 19 come from, especially those in subsection (1)? There seems to be no exemption, other than structural impracticability. I can think of many examples in a house that I own where I might want to build an extension or carry out modifications, but I would have to knock the whole house down. It might be a listed building or there may be all sorts of other reasons why it would be difficult to modify, but not impracticable or impossible. I do not think that the words were lifted from somewhere else, and I do not believe that they would work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My suggestion concerns the Palace of Westminster. We are constantly making extensions and material alterations to it. We should try to apply the intention of the Bill to the entire Palace of Westminster and see how we would achieve that. We would discover what exemptions we would want or need, and what progress we could make. That would give us a better idea of what we were imposing on others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that the principle of access should be applied to new constructions. Problems relating to existing buildings, adaptations and extensions are covered by the provision. No exemptions are listed, except the structurally impracticable case. The clause is intended as a general provision, but it recognises that there may be circumstances in which it would be difficult to live up to the principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be possible to find more adequate wording than the term "structurally impracticable", but the clause seems to meet the concern that new buildings and constructions should allow proper access. Some alteration to regulations might be necessary to assist the building of lifetime homes in which people would be able to move around as their circumstances and conditions changed. We are all potentially disabled people, so that is of great importance. I am always willing to consider an alternative way of arguing the same principle. Generally, access should be built into the new provisions, but there may be difficult circumstances which make that impossible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People might want to change the boundaries between the two areas and alternative forms of wording may be
	<span class='label label-info column'>258</span>
necessary. At present, we stand by the provision, although we shall consider alternative arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the measure apply to upstairs bedrooms in a new maisonette?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is covered by the Bill. Part of the dynamic of the application is the role of the Disability Rights Commission, which would be concerned with buildings. The structural practicalities of providing access inside houses beyond the ground floor must be considered. There may be difficulties in making structural adaptations that comply with the principle of full access. Provisions which specify a chair lift, for example, in a building of more than one storey must be taken seriously by architects and others when drawing up plans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<li>a person who considers that he may have been discriminated against, in contravention of any provision of Part III, is referred to as "the complainant"; and</li>

</ol></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is important, as my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham pointed out. We could spend much longer discussing it. It sets out the remedies that an industrial tribunal may award in cases of well-founded complaints, and outlines the route of appeal to the employment appeal tribunal when a point of law is at issue. However, the Bill makes a significant omission. New clause 10 would remedy that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 10 would introduce a questionnaire procedure, similar to that under sex discrimination and race discrimination legislation. Under the procedure, potential complaints could question their employers to decide whether to take their cases to an industrial tribunal. The majority of applicants who appear before industrial tribunals are not legally represented. The Government envisages that the Secretary of State for Employment will produce a statutory questionnaire to help people, when questioning an employer, to gain the relevant information on which to judge whether there is a case to answer. If individuals understood that their employers had a valid and lawful reason for acting as they did, the number of complaints might be reduced. The questionnaire would help complainants and their employers to focus on relevant information and enable Advisory, Conciliation and
	<span class='label label-info column'>260</span>
Arbitration Service officers and tribunals to identify the key points of a dispute more easily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The emphasis of the Bill should be on helping disabled people to obtain work and to retain their jobs. The Government believe that it is important to help disabled people and their employers as much as possible to resolve disputes as they arise. The questionnaire and the work of conciliation officers would help to achieve that. We shall not oppose clause 27, but I invite the Committee to accept new clause 10.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the context of the Bill, new clause 10 is rather different from the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Bill.

The Disability Discrimination Bill does not provide for such an advisory body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman said that new clause 10 was acceptable. That is welcome.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should not accept new clause 10 without noting (3)(b)(i) and (ii). In effect, the Committee will accept that the right to silence can be used to the employer's disadvantage. The new clause 10 provides that if,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the respondent deliberately, and without reasonable excuse, omitted to reply within a reasonable period"</p></blockquote>
the tribunal could draw an inference from that.

The equivalent provisions in the Disability Discrimination Bill cover not only agreements purporting to prevent people from presenting a complaint or bringing proceedings before a tribunal, but also agreements that purport to require a person to contravene any provision of the Bill and agreements that purport to exclude or limit the operation of any provision of the Bill.

It is right that disabled people should not be placed in a position whereby they could be pressured into signing away their rights.

Amendment No. 75 makes provisions about national security.

It is a standard provision, which features in many Acts or Parliament, including the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and the Race Relations Act 1976. Similar provisions are to be found in the Disability Discrimination Bill. It ought to be included in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 13 provides that the provisions of the Bill do not take precedence over any enactment made before or after the Bill's passing into law. The Bill does not therefore make lawful any act done in compliance with other legislation. The new clause also provides that the Bill does not outlaw an act done to comply with a requirement imposed by a Minister of the Crown or to safeguard national security. The Bill should not take precedence over such matters as the need to ensure health and safety at work. However, the Bill would still require an employer to consider making changes to overcome a health and safety problem if that could be done within the terms of the health and safety legislation. Additionally, nothing in the Bill should make unlawful any act done for the purpose of safeguarding national security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 16 provides that in making appointments to an office or post outside the scope of the Bill, Ministers and Departments are to act as though part III of the Bill did apply. The main areas that the new clause would relate to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0237">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>263</span>
are appointments to posts where there is no contract of service and where the service is not for the purpose of a Minister or department—for example, certain appointments to non-departmental public bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power to make regulations, set out in subsection (3), would allow the Secretary of State to exempt the selection of specific appointments from the requirement to act in accordance with part III, although I do not at the moment envisage any use for that power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is broadly in line with the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and the Race Relations Act 1976. A similar provision is contained in the Disability Discrimination Bill. I commend the amendment and the new clauses to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a desire that the Bill should tie in with sex discrimination and race relations legislation, but I am not convinced that that should be achieved by changing the Bill. Perhaps the other legislation could be adjusted to tie in with the Bill in its present form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulties that might arise in terms of national security are not as obvious to me as they seem to be to the Minister. Perhaps they could be made clearer to me in the brief discussion that we are now having, but as things stand I am not disposed to accept the amendment or the new clauses. I accept, however, that we have reached a stage—it is a pity that we did not reach it earlier—at which we are discussing amendments that generally accept the framework of the Bill. Those, rather than wrecking amendments, are exactly the type of amendments that need discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that that could be slightly better phrased. We are considering the Bill as though there were agreement on the framework, to allow discussion to go forward and to allow the Bill to come out of Committee, which will be greatly welcome to the promoter of the next Bill, on whose Committee I shall also be serving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right to say that there are normally two ways in which to achieve what at least one of the new clauses proposes: either the Bill could say that it gives way to other legislation or other legislation could say that it is superior to the Bill. However, if other legislation was enacted before the Bill was contemplated it would be extremely difficult for it to mention it in particular. Presumably, there would have to be some power under secondary legislation to make a provision subordinate to previous legislation. Otherwise, we would end up with a traffic jam.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Had we more time it would be interesting to ask what would happen if two Bills were potentially in conflict and each said that it gave way to the other. I would not want to trouble the Government's legal advisers with that issue at the moment. If we want to make progress and finish the Bill's Committee stage by 1 o'clock, the hon. Gentleman would be well advised not to oppose sensible provisions that have appeared in similar legislation to overcome discrimination in other fields.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment and the new clauses are intended constructively. They mirror provisions in other legislation and without them there would be loopholes and omissions in the Bill.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rather than spending all our time on hypothetical issues—we do not know whether we shall get through all the new clauses—the sensible approach is that the Committee accept amendment No. 75.

	<div class='title'>AMENDMENT OF EDUCATION ACT 1993</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Berry 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingswood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a problem with the clause. It refers to section 160 of the Education Act 1993, which I do not understand fully. The clause would mean that that section would now read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any person exercising any functions under this Part of this Act in respect of a child with special educational needs who should be educated in a school shall secure that the child is educated in a school which is not a special school unless that is incompatible with the wishes of his parent."</p></blockquote>
That means that any parent can insist on a special school place even if that were not in the interests of the child. That is my problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are examples of local education authorities arguing that a child's needs would be better met through mainstream, integrated education. The clause would amend section 160 of the 1993 Act which would, as I understand
	<span class='label label-info column'>266</span>
it, effectively result in some children being inappropriately placed in special schools if that was their parents' preference. If my reading of the clause is correct, many people, including many disabled people, would find it of dubious value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Member for Kingswood is right to say that people would not find that acceptable. However, I am not sure that his interpretation of the effect of clause 31 is right. Let us look as clause 32, which makes provision for Scotland. It provides that new section 60A "shall be inserted"—added, not omitted, as in clause 31—after section 60 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. New section 60A(1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of an education authority in respect of a child with special educational needs who belongs to their area … to secure that the child is educated in a school which is not a special school, unless that is incompatible with the wishes of the parent."</p></blockquote>
Under clause 31 a child must go to a school which is not a special school unless the parents object. I do not think that clause 31 would require the education authority to provide a special school if the parents insist. It is the other way round—a child cannot go to a mainstream school if the parents object.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it does mean the latter—that is, if the parents object, the child should not go to a mainstream school. That is precisely my concern. There are circumstances in which it would clearly be in the child's interests to attend a mainstream school and receive integrated education. If the parents were not happy about that the clause, as I read it, I would effectively give them the veto. If my understanding is correct, I must express a strong reservation to any measure which would provide such a degree of restriction on integrated education when it was appropriate to meet the needs of the child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have strong reservations about clause 31—indeed, I am opposed to it—for reasons which I gave earlier and which are not dissimilar to the points raised by the hon. Member for Kingswood. I think that I have followed his point, although it is one that we have not considered before in our debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At our previous sitting, when I moved amendment No. 54 to clause 12, I referred to the problems which would be created by the Bill cutting across the delicate balance of section 160 of the 1993 Act. I made that speech two weeks ago on 24 May and it can be read in column 227 of 	<i>Hansard.</i> Indeed, it may run into other columns as it was of substantial length.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1993 Act, which has had a great deal of support from organisations of and for disabled people, sought to balance the wishes of parents, the educational needs of other children and the resources available to the authority. To complement the point of the hon. Member for Kingswood, as a result of this clause, children with, say, severe emotional or behavioural difficulties could be put into a mainstream school when it would be better for the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0239">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>267</span>
other children if they attended a special school. Some children will still have to go to special schools, although I think that all members of the Committee would like the great majority of children with disabilities to go into mainstream education. Under the clause, not only could some children go to special schools when it might be better for them to go to mainstream schools but, in a limited number of cases, it could work the other way round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause would disturb the extremely delicate balance achieved in the 1993 Act, which has been well received and is so far working well. The clause is dangerous and has not been thought out properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be best for the Committee not to accept clause 31—and possibly not clause 32, which I imagine will have a similar effect. Of course, we may return to them later, if the Bill reaches a later stage. What my hon. Friend the Minister said provided an additional argument for new clause 13. He said that the provisions of the Bill might cut across other Acts. New clause 13 would leave other Acts with their power and effect, if the Bill otherwise inadvertently removed their provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even with new clause 13, clause 31 would override the Education Act 1993, because it specifically says so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be an argument for including new clause 13 and not clause 31, unless it is reintroduced with substantial modifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a serious issue that is beyond the expertise of many members of the Committee. The hon. Member for Kingswood was right to say that whatever the interpretation of the effect on the other clause, we do not want parents to be able unreasonably and unilaterally to make decisions that are not in their childrens' interest. That is a warning: perhaps we should let clause 31 rest for the time being and return to it when more specialist advice is available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we should let the clause rest in for the moment. I accept the sensitivity of the problems involved. My hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood has been contemplating producing an amendment based upon the arguments that the hon. Gentleman has propounded, and will undoubtedly do so later. I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The desire for those young persons—children—who suffer from disabilities to be involved as fully as possible in mainstream education which allows children to share with each other, and which therefore helps children who are disabled to have a greater understanding of the society in which they are involved, is important. If it is felt that the balance of the clauses is not exact or that there might be problems with the clauses cutting across existing legislation, as has been suggested in our discussion today and previously, that must be seriously considered, and I am quite happy to do so. However, I would like the linchpins that will enable future debates on those matters to be held in place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 84, in page 18, leave out lines 12 to 16 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(3) This section comes into force on the passing of this Act.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(4) The other provisions of this Act come into force on such day as the Secretary of State may by order appoint and different days may be appointed for different purposes.'.</p></blockquote>
Clause 38 deals with the short title, extent and commencement of the Bill. As currently drafted, there is requirement that parts III, IV and V of the Act should come into effect six months after the Act is passed which would lead to a great deal of trouble for service providers, employers and disabled people alike. The lack of time to prepare would lead to a great deal of difficulty and it is possible that this style of implementation could create a large amount of resentment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be sensible in the way that the provisions are implemented. This amendment provides that clause 38 comes into force immediately the Act is passed, and the other provisions of the Act should come into effect when the Secretary of State appoints. It allows different provisions within the Bill to be brought into effect at different times and for different purposes by a commencement order. That will allow us to ensure that the detailed provisions are in line with the wishes of disabled people, employers and service providers. It will also make sure that business can afford to deliver the changes required according to a sensible timetable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment will also allow the Secretary of State to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0240">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>269</span>
consult on areas contained within the Bill before the relevant areas have come into force, thereby taking into account representations from interested parties before finalising the effects of those provisions. This flexibility is essential for the Bill to be effective in practice and mirrors the commencement provisions in the Disability Discrimination Bill, which have already been accepted as sensible during the Committee stage of that Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remain troubled, and this brings me back to a point that I made earlier, that the Act comes into force within six months but under clause 3 the codes of practice do not have to be drawn up for 18 months. There appears to be a hiatus when the Act will be in force, legal responsibilities will be in existence and rights will have been created but not the codes of practice which explain them. That sets alarm bells ringing for me about how it would be implemented. I would welcome the hon. Gentleman's comments on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The alarm bells that ring with me are that nothing will be done because the Government have their own Disability Discrimination Bill.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very unhappy about the Minister's alternative suggestion. He may have arguments about practicalities and phasing. There has been much discussion about that with disability organisations which are keen that matters should be moved on apace and that the pressure should be there to begin to act. Given the Minister's practical points I shall not say that the provisions are in the Bill for all time—there must be further procedures—but I cannot accept the amendment, which contains dangers that I have already described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The trouble with saying that the provisions are not there for all time is that the provisions of Acts are indeed there for all time unless an amendment is made. My hon. Friend the Minister's points are convincing. I understand, especially looking at—or rather, past—the hon.

The purpose of the new clause is to insert a provision similar to those in the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, the Race Relations Act 1976 and the Disability Discrimination Bill, for cases of victimisation, even against people who may themselves not be disabled, to be made unlawful. It concerns situations in which it can be shown that a person has discriminated against and victimised another due to previous actions or intentions in relation to proceedings under the Bill. The new clause offers the necessary protection in such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential that the new clause be included so that disabled people can rely on the help and support of non-disabled people when they are being discriminated against. The new clause will ensure that it is unlawful to victimise non-disabled people. For example, let us consider the case of a disabled person who has been discriminated against at work and has taken a claim of unjustifiable discrimination to an industrial tribunal; a non-disabled colleague helps the disabled person by giving evidence to the tribunal that clearly shows that unjustifiable discrimination has taken place. It is not too difficult to imagine that an employer might look on the other employee's actions unfavourably and might attempt to take some kind of revenge for putting him in trouble with the tribunal. The employer then victimises the non-disabled employee. As the Bill is currently drafted there is nothing that the able-bodied employee can do, as he does not satisfy the definition of disability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely that cannot be right. He is being victimised because he helped somebody else who was protected by the Bill's provisions. The new clause would allow the non-disabled employee to bring an action against the unscrupulous employer. It would encourage people to support disabled people when they brought actions against employers or service providers without allowing discriminatory action to be taken against them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Discrimination by way of victimisation is covered in the race and sex discrimination legislation. There is no specific
	<span class='label label-info column'>272</span>
cover in the Bill for victimisation. The clause has deliberately been phrased in this way to offer a parallel approach to that in those other pieces of legislation. It is my intention to give clarity and guidance to employers, tribunals and disabled people about such situations and I hope that other members of the Committee feel the same way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is widely admired is the way in which my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East has proceeded in close consultation with the organisations of and for disabled people. I take it that, having consulted so closely with organisations, he would like to proceed with the new clauses as he has before and say, "I have listened to what has been said here. I will discuss that with disabled people and their organisations and come back at a later stage." I take it that that is my hon. Friend's approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I jolly well hope not!

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Wythenshawe may be right that there should be discussion with people outside the House. That is perfectly proper. But the new clause has now been on the amendment paper for six or seven weeks. It is not something that I have brought up today. Its purpose is perfectly clear and it has been sitting there since 24 April, when I tabled the new clauses. There has been plenty of time for discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one could have anticipated the agreement that appears to have been reached between the two sides of the Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East has been trying to cope, sitting by sitting, with items that he thought would be discussed. I am sure that he is right to bias his approach in favour of consultation with the organisations which were deeply involved in the drafting of the Bill from the outset.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is different is that the Minister has now argued his case for the new clause. That produces a different situation from that of the new clause merely being on the amendment paper. Because of the Minister's references to the similarity with sex discrimination and race relations legislation, I am favourably disposed to his position, but I want to have those further discussions. I am not saying that as part of a pattern that I will follow with the rest of the new clauses, but the measure relating to victimisation contains an important set of principles and I am well disposed to it. An opportunity to allow that discussion to solidify would be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, to be fair to him, has been very constructive about a number of amendments, particularly during our discussion today. I do not criticise him for that, but I must criticise him a little on this occasion. There has been a lot of time to consider the new clause. There is no valid excuse in terms of there having been inadequate time to consult on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>'. Nothing in this Act shall render unlawful the treatment of a person in relation to an annuity, life assurance policy, accident insurance policy, or similar matter involving the assessment of risk, where the treatment—

</ol></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would ensure that insurance companies will continue to be allowed to consider actuarial data, or other data from a source on which it is reasonable to rely, when assessing the insurance risk of a disabled person without being accused of unlawful discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I explain the detail of the new clause, it is important that the Committee understand the background. The United Kingdom insurance market is highly competitive. In that market, there is considerable variance in the degree of cover provided, rate of premiums charged and policy imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Insurance is the business of selecting and calculating risks and setting premiums to correspond to those risks. When disability has no effect on the risk, it should be disregarded in the calculation of the premium and in setting policy conditions. That is why we have included coverage of financial services in the Government's Disability Discrimination Bill. However, disabled people, like others, can have a medical condition that, in the case of life insurance, can affect mortality. Insurers must be able to take those factors into account in setting premium rates and policy conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, discrimination is, to some extent, the basis of the insurance industry. Although it is right that insurance companies must be allowed to discriminate, we should not be prepared to let them discriminate unfairly. That is what the Government Bill will prevent and what the hon. Member for Kingswood said was his objective when he sponsored his Bill last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many hon. Members will remember that in the Government's consultation document last year it was suggested that there was little evidence of unfair discrimination. It is fair to say that many people disagreed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0243">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>275</span>
with that, and the Government took on board the responses to the consultation. I will not go through the cases that were described, as many members of the Committee will already be familiar with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have previously discussed in Committee, the implications for business of the definitions of "disability" and "qualified person with a disability", taken together with the definition of "discrimination", are unclear. They are probably sufficiently elastic to allow a court to decide that, when dealing with a disabled person, insurers should not reflect differences between risks in their underwriting decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not to allow insurers to assess the risks arising from medical conditions would be farcical, however. Medical underwriting is central to the provision of life insurance, and the assessment of medical risk is fundamental to most other types of insurance—permanent health, critical illness, medical, personal accident and sickness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingswood—I apologise for detaining him in Committee when he wishes to leave for a moment—knows about those fears because, as he explained last year during the consideration of his Bill, he thought it necessary to meet representatives of the Association of British Insurers. They, naturally, were worried that his Bill amounted to a withdrawal of an insurer's ability to differentiate risks. He will remember that his meeting with the ABI followed the tabling of an amendment similar to new clause 17 and a similar provision in the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, which the ABI had inspired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not clear from reading the official reports of that time, but the hon. Gentleman presumably thought, after he met the ABI, that the association had a point, and that discrimination on the basis of documented risk should be permitted. He may wish to correct the view that I am ascribing to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, the reason for meeting the ABI was that the association requested it, and we met any organisation that wanted a meeting. Secondly, the ABI seemed to misunderstand the Bill and thought it would abolish insurance as it is known. It was important to meet the association and point out that the Bill contained no such provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, it is not the hon. Gentleman's intention to abolish insurance as it is known. We seem to be in agreement about what we are trying to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Insurance companies should not be able to discriminate, except on the basis of clear actuarial or other evidence, which is an important part of their business. New clause 17 would make that clear and reflect in the Bill the need for insurers to be aware of the main forms of disability, and whether they have any relevance in assessing the size or probability of an insurance claim; the need for insurers to be aware of the wide range of conditions which might
	<span class='label label-info column'>276</span>
amount to disability; the need for insurers to be able still to reflect claims experience, mortality or other relevant factors in their underwriting, and the need for insurers to ask only for medical information which is demonstrably related to the additional risk associated with insuring the disabled person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those considerations can be summarised as a need to ensure that insurance companies charge higher premiums only when that is based on a reasonable assessment of risk, and not on any illogical or irrational ground or—perhaps worse—no ground at all. Where bona fide actuarial evidence exists, there is no problem. Any action based fairly on such information will be reasonable. We must make that clear. That is the purpose of new clause 17, and I am sure that most members of the Committee support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Masses of disabled people face great problems with insurance companies. As a constituency Member of Parliament—apart from being the promoter of the Bill—my postbag often reflects those difficulties. There is a widespread feeling that matters that are irrelevant to actuarial consideration are taken into account simply because a person happens to be disabled. In those circumstances, premium rights that exist for other people in terms of the full coverage of insurance begins to be taken away. Obviously, legislation must tackle that problem. However, I fully accept the Minister's points about the nature of insurance. Insurance companies must take into account hosts of actuarial considerations in making judgments and will not operate a blanket provision, irrespective of the circumstances of the persons concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must satisfy both principles. We must operate insurance as it has operated while ensuring that its principles are properly extended to disabled people. The Minister gives a correct defence of the insurance industry: it must not have unreasonable burdens. On that basis, I accept the new clause. I shall discuss it further with disabled organisations and shall leave myself the right to suggest amendments to the new clause at a later stage. But, they would not be wrecking amendments; they would ensure that the right guaranteed to insurance companies is not operated in a way that hampers the rights for disabled people that we are seeking to establish. The Minister's arguments and the new clause are, at this stage, acceptable and should be included in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a welcome response to the new clause. The reference in new clause 17 to
	<br><blockquote><p>"data from a source on which it was reasonable to rely"</p></blockquote>
is important. For example, disabled motorists rightly complain about loaded insurance premiums for which there is no justification in data that covers stolen cars, crashes from excess speed or drink-driving incidents. Insurance companies should regard disabled people as likely, according to data, to have a lower claims record than others, but for different reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the realism of the Minister and the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East. Nowadays, insurance
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0244">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>277</span>
is worldwide and can be arranged over the telephone and by electronic money transmission. The idea that we can build a wall around our island and say, "Only insurance companies in this country will be affected", would be as wrong as to claim that the same argument applied to banking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that people will not go to extremes, even with the new clause. For example, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers made a deal with an insurance company for a 20 per cent. discount for teachers and lecturers. That deal discriminates against those who are not teachers or lecturers or, perhaps those who are disabled. There are many examples of marketing gimmicks that people, if they took an extreme view, could argue contravened the Bill. I hope that we shall be realistic. I welcome the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
