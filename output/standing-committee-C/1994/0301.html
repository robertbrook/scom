	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed [22 February],</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the remaining proceedings on the Activity Centres (Young Persons' Safety) Bill the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.—	<i>[Mr. Jamieson.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good morning. I inform the Committee that I have selected an amendment to the sittings motion in the name of the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington). I suggest that he moves it formally at the end of the debate on the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Lidington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aylesbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment encapsulates the remarks that I made during the previous sitting. It would be inconvenient for members of the Committee who have made arrangements for this afternoon were we to commence afternoon sittings this week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is general good will towards the Bill and no reason why we should not accomplish proper consideration within three sittings. I hope that the Bill's proposer will be able to accept my proposal. Do you want me to move the amendment now, Mr. Hill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, at the end of the debate, please.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Liddington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that, for the reasons that I have given, the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) will feel able to accept the proposal that today we have a morning sitting only, but next week, if it proves necessary—and I believe that to be unlikely—we can sit in the afternoon as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it helps the Committee, I am happy to accept the amendment. Last week, when it became clear that there were 55 amendments, I thought that we might be detained for a long time, but as there have been only three further amendments, one of which has been tabled by the hon. Member for Aylesbury, I am happy to accept the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made,</i> in line 3, after 'and', insert

	<br><blockquote><p>That during the remaining proceedings on the Activity Centres (Young Persons' Safety) Bill, the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o-clock and with effect from Wednesday 8 March also at half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>ADVENTURE ACTIVITIES: LICENSING</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Piers Merchant 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beckenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 23, in page 1, line 16, leave out 'may' and insert 'shall'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is straightforward and would leave out the word "may" and insert the word "shall" in the provisions for regulations. We all agree that the Bill is important and that its effectiveness depends on the thoroughness with which the regulations are drawn up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little worried by the use of the word "may". That may seem to be a minor point, but if the Bill is to work as intended and give full protection to children and visitors to outdoor centres, it is vital that the regulations, when they are drawn up, should be thorough and far-reaching.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid that leaving the Bill as it is presently worded may result in regulations being loose and covering only some of those important matters. I do not propose to delay the Committee for long, but I want to say a few words about the need for the legislation to be complete.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By changing "may" to "shall", the amendment would impose a requirement on the Minister and the licensing authority to draw up regulations covering each of those aspects. For example, on requirements relating to safety, clause 1(3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Regulations may make provisions as to—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) any requirements relating to safety (whether applying to facilities for adventure activities or to other facilities) which must be satisfied by an applicant for a licence".</p></blockquote>
It should be crystal clear that the Bill will impose an obligation to make regulations on requirements relating to safety because that aspect is so important. That is one of the Bill's crucial objectives. When dealing with disasters such as the Lyme bay disaster, it is essential that, if we alter the law, we alter it to give full protection to all those involved in outdoor activity centres by ensuring that regulations on safety are of paramount importance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gary Streeter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Sutton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much agree with my hon Friend's remarks. Does he accept that, if his amendment is successful, those who will be charged with drawing up the regulations will be able to use the provisions as a checklist of all the things that they have to consider by law, but if the word "may" is retained, they will be able to skip over clause 1(3) (a) or (b)? If we insert the word "shall", there will be a checklist which they will have no option but to consider, even if the regulations are not then particularly onerous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Merchant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, my hon. Friend is absolutely right
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0026">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
and he encapsulates my point. The phrases in clause 1(3) are general and do not provide for the specific provisions of regulations. They are headlines for the regulations that will be drawn up, so they provide a useful checklist and say to those who will draw up the regulations, "You will have regulations in these areas." The phrases cover all the headline points that we would want the regulations to cover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to draw attention to two other important points. Clause 1(3) (h) covers
	<br><blockquote><p>"the investigation by the licensing authority of complaints concerning licence-holders".</p></blockquote>
It is important that the regulations provide full powers for investigation to be carried out. It is not sufficient for the regulations simply to exist if there is no facility for ensuring that they are fulfilled and that action is taken if they are not fulfilled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, I believe that clause 1(3)(j), which covers
	<br><blockquote><p>"the keeping, and availability for inspection by the public, of a register of licences",</p></blockquote>
is an important deterrent it is also important for open government that those who have been granted licences are known to the public and can easily by checked. If I am fortunate and we are able to discuss a later amendment, I will seek to strengthen that clause because I believe it to be important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the conditions relating to inspection by the licensing authority, included in clause 1(3)(c), are also important. I hope that, by strengthening this part of the Bill, we will enable the requirements for drawing up regulations to be clearer, more precise and mandatory and, in so doing, will pursue the objective of the Bill in a more effective way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Stern 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to express a minor doubt about the amendment to which my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham (Mr Merchant) spoke so comprehensively. He will recollect the concern expressed on Second Reading about the need to get this measure on to the statute book as quickly as possible. However, before the Act—as it will then be—is in operation and the licensing authority set up, activity centres should know in advance what regulations are likely to be introduced. In that way, even though the law will not be in operation by the coming summer season, centres can at that time comply with the regulations that will be introduced in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about turning a guidance provision into a mandatory provision, and I look forward to hearing the advice of my hon. Friend the Minister. It may be necessary to delay the wording of the eventual regulations and the dissemination of that wording while lawyers—and we all know and love the legal profession, and the extent to which
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
it does its work effectively and comprehensively—check all the regulations that have so far been drafted to ensure that they meet the new mandatory requirements rather than the former permissive requirements. I hope that either my hon. Friend the Minister or the hon. Member for Devenport can reassure men on that point in what otherwise seems a useful amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Education (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can immediately confirm what my hon. Friend says. My love for the legal profession is unbounded, as Mrs. Forth happens to be a lawyer. The amendment takes us into the familiar territory of our old friends "shall" or "may". In this case, however, it is in a different and important context. There is an "in principle" part to the argument: is it good law-making for the Bill to prescribe precisely what the Secretary of State should do? To do that is always a temptation for the members of a Committee, who have been in similar situations many times. However, there are very few occasions when it is sensible and good law to seek, at such an early stage of a Bill's proceedings, to include in it a detailed prescription of what should happen. That is even more true of this Bill, because its promoter has very wisely drafted it as a framework enabling measure, recognising that the effectiveness of the provisions that he wants to introduce will lie in the detail. It is acknowledged that such detail can sensibly be introduced only after extensive consultation. That much has always been common ground. I believe that all members of the Committee have signalled, in their different ways, that they are comfortable with that approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Applying that principle to the amendment shows it in a different light. My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham wants the Bill to state that the regulations "shall" make provision as to the comprehensive list that features in paragraphs (a) through to (1). I understand the reason for including such a provision: it gives a sense of certainty and predictability, it fixes the ideas in the Bill and enables everyone to march forwards with confidence. However, such an approach is completely at odds with the basis on which the Bill has proceeded so far—namely, that the consultation process is likely to throw up matters which may alter the emphasis and even the detail of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we pinned ourselves down, and fixed this list, albeit as the minimum, as my hon. Friend suggests, we may find, after consultation, that one or two of the items on it are inappropriate. Even with my undoubted respect for the Bill's promoter, I do not think that he is necessarily gifted with such foresight and prescience that he can predict accurately the outcome of the consultation process or what is likely to follow it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Wolfson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sevenoaks)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend the Minister agree that his arguments are strengthened by the fact that the Bill is an enabling Bill? The key is the consultation that will follow the Bill. Therefore, I strongly support my hon. Friend's arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. My
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0027">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
arguments reflect the thrust of his speech on Second Reading and we all agreed with that. My hon. Friend pointed out that legitimate interests will have something positive and helpful to say about how to make the Bill as effective as possible. That will become clear during the consultation process. I believe that that might alter the thrust of some parts of the list currently in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand what my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham wanted to do in the amendment, but I ask him to think again. The Bill's existing wording is right. It gives us a framework on which to operate and then leads us naturally into the consultation process. It then gives the Secretary of State of the day the flexibility to take account of the consultation process and to frame the regulations appropriately following the consultation. That is the right way to proceed. For all the reasons that I have given, I urge the Committee to reject the amendment and to stand by the original words in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the dangers of our debates is that we are trying to anticipate what may happen at the next stage—the regulations and secondary legislation that will be brought before the House. In our anxiety to view the legislation in its full form, many of the amendments, including this one, try to place the type of detail in the Bill that I would expect to appear in secondary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would agree to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Beckenham if line one of the clause did not contain the word "shall". If line one read the "Secretary of State may", I would be concerned about the effectiveness of the Bill. However, the use of the word "shall" in line one means that the use of the word "may" in line 16 is adequate to cover the provisions that we want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Committee's attention to column 600 of the Second Reading debate. This matter was raised with the Minister, and, just as he has unbounding respect for me, I have unbounding respect for his integrity. On that occasion, he gave positive assurances that the use of the word "shall" in line one would oblige the Secretary of State to proceed with the other items in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am fairly relaxed about the amendment. My other feeling, which I share with the Minister, is that it is possible that during the consultation period we may find that items on the list may need a different emphasis or require striking out altogether. I am more worried, however, that the insertion of the word "shall" in line 16 may make the clause appear exclusive rather than inclusive. After consultation, it may mean that we exclude items for which we may wish to make regulations. As I said, I am fairly relaxed about the amendment and I understand the motives of the hon. Member for Beckenham. As the Minister has explained, however, the amendment may be more restrictive than we want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Merchant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a useful debate. Perhaps I can answer a few of the points raised even though, having unbounded respect for both the Minister and the hon. Member for Devenport, I find it difficult to challenge their judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
A number of points emerge, including that made by the Bill's promoter about the use of the words "shall" and "may". I am not entirely convinced that the use of "shall" in clause 1(1) overrides the need for "shall" in subsection (3). After all, requiring the Secretary of State to designate the licensing authority is one thing; requiring him to make regulations for the licensing authority to carry out is another, separate matter. A distinction exists there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am more persuaded by the argument about the danger of excluding things, although I am bound to say that the fact that an Act requires things to be done does not mean that other things cannot also be done. However, I do not wish the Bill to be restricted so, for that reason, I am prepared to give the hon. Member for Devonport the benefit of the doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West (Mr. Stem) mentioned transitional arrangements, and his argument was quite powerful. We do not wish the complications inherent in drawing up all the Bill's requirements to delay its implementation and effectiveness. Later in the Bill, however, there is a power for the Minister to include transitional provisions in regulations. I imagine that that would enable us to overcome the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During his remarks about the Bill's general structure, the Minister was right to say that it is an enabling Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This causes me some concern because I am not especially happy about enabling legislation that is so widely drawn. We seem to be giving the Minister an awful lot of power. I have no doubt whatever about giving this Minister such powers because we have so much respect for him, as we keep telling each other, but there is a danger that a less worthy man might hold the office—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or woman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Merchant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, although I do not usually think of women as being less worthy than my hon. Friend. However, there is always the danger that the powers might in such circumstances not be carried out as effectively as I am sure my hon. Friend would wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consultation was mentioned, and of course, it is very important. Consultation should indeed be thorough and all-encompassing—perhaps more so than simply being written into the Bill. However, consultation must be designed to improve the Bill's effectiveness rather than detract from it. Therefore, I do not necessarily see a clash between consultation and regulations that are thoroughly defined in the Bill and place a requirement on the Minister to take action. Consultation would go into the detail of the regulations which these headlines do not address, and would perhaps find the most effective way of drawing them up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister said that regulations might not be necessary to cover all the headlines encompassed by the Bill. That may be so, although I suspect that, eventually, regulations will cover them all. If they do not, it would be simple to draft a regulation with so light a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0028">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
touch that it answered the requirement to produce a regulation while not imposing unnecessary control or restraint on those affected by it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to spoil the Bill or to impede its effectiveness. As I am assured by both the Bill's promoter and the Minister that the existing wording is satisfactory, with a little reluctance I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 20, after 'any', insert 'reasonable'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 25, in page 1, line 23, leave out 'may' and insert 'shall'</p>
	<p>No. 3, in page 1, line 24, after 'include', insert 'reasonable'</p>
	<p>No. 2, in page 1, line 25, after 'imposing', insert reasonable'.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 1, 3 and 2 are probing amendments, designed to encourage the hon. Member for Devonport and my hon. Friend the Minister to tell us a little more about their thoughts on the balance that the Bill and its enabling powers seek to strike between the needs of safety and the reasonable expectations of people who try to run a business, whether in the commercial or voluntary sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My three amendments would impose a test of reasonableness on the Secretary of State's exercise of his power to make regulations under clause 1(1). Amendment No. 1 would impose the test on regulations made by the Secretary of State about the safety requirements that he would require of a licence holder who applies either for a new licence or for renewal of an existing licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 3 would impose the test and would require the Secretary of State's power to be exercised reasonably when the Secretary of State lays downs, by regulation, conditions relating to the inspection of facilities by the licensing authority. Amendment No. 2, which relates to subsection (3)(c), is consequential on amendment No. 1 and refers back to that amendment and its effect on subsection (3)(b).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to be careful about giving broad, sweeping enabling powers to a Minister, whatever our views about the outstanding merits of a particular incumbent. These matters are of the utmost significance, most obviously for parents and children. I think that all members of the Committee accept the need for a statutory system of regulation that will give schools and parents confidence that adequate safety rules exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also bear in mind the effect that badly

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Streeter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend share my concern about how some of our courts are expanding their jurisdiction to decide on Government legislation? Is he aware that if the word "reasonable" is included in the provisions, the test of reasonableness can be taken only by a court of law? Does not my hon. Friend share my preference for elected Members of Parliament and Ministers to make law rather than for the courts, which are sometimes presided over by judges who can be a teeny-weeny bit out of touch?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I defer to the legal expertise of my hon. Friend for Plymouth, Sutton (Mr. Streeter). However, there is a problem with the point that he made. It is all very well for us to say that we stand by the right of Parliament to lay down precisely the legal and regulatory framework within which our citizens go about their lives, but the Bill gives a fairly sweeping enabling power to the Secretary of State of the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid that it is a fact of life—if I did not know before, I have learnt it over the past three years—that the scrutiny by Parliament of statutory instruments is sometimes less than thorough. We must consider whether the Bill should contain a test that a regulation would have to embody before the Secretary of State is entitled to exercise the enabling power.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two matters are at stake for the operator of an activity centre who falls foul of the regulations. First and most importantly, he would run the risk of a criminal record and facing the penalties that will be imposed by clause 2. The second applies even if an operator is not convicted of an offence created by the Act. As I understand it, an operator whom the licensing authority deems not be complying with the regulations that the authority enforces could have his livelihood taken from him. I shall await the response of the Bill's promoter, but when the regulations could lead to the loss of someone's livelihood, we must be sure that they are drafted and enforced in a reasonable way that gives due weight to the balance of interests. I rest my case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that hon. Members will refer to that point. As I made clear, they are probing amendments.

debate. It will be debatable to the point that there is a real danger that a rogue activity centre that is not totally scrupulous or honest will use the word as a lever to avoid its obligations. That is extremely dangerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By and large, I would not like legislation to be too prescriptive. We should rely on plain common sense. However, in this case the track record of mismanaged activity centres means that we should be prescriptive, and the requirements on them should be clear. The word "reasonable" will create a tranche of problems and should not appear. If given an inch, a rogue activity centre will take a mile. It will always find excuses why it should wriggle out of an obligation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Llin Golding 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle-under-Lyme)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also oppose the word "reasonable". What is it reasonable to expect people to do in such circumstances?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anything accessible should be kept to a required standard that makes it not dangerous. The sea is an exceptionally dangerous place, however calm it looks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall tell a brief story which illustrates that even Members of Parliament sometimes behave stupidly, [hon. Members "Surely not."] Even on St. David's day, I have to say that two Welsh Members of Parliament behaved stupidly—myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Cynon Valley (Mrs. Clwyd), whom I visited when on holiday in Wales. She has a boat at Aberdovey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We decided to go fishing in the bay. My hon. Friend has a small sailing boat that she uses to reach a yacht that she keeps in the harbour. She had never been out in the bay and used the boat only for access, so it was kept to a standard that was not fitted for going out in the bay. We did not consider that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We donned our life jackets and decided that we were safe. It was a beautiful day. There was not a breath of wind, the sea was flat calm and it as beautifully warm—tee-shirt-and-shorts weather. We took our fishing rods and went out into the bay using a motor on the small sailing boat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We fished for an hour with boats all round us, then turned to come back in. We, had almost reached the harbour entrance when the motor cut out. We had run out of petrol. We thought that we could just manage to row into the harbour entrance, even though the tide was going out. We looked for the oars, but there was only one. The little holes to put them through were missing as well. [Hon. Members: "Rowlocks."] That shows how much I know about these things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We started to go round in circles as we paddled and I decided to hoist the sail. There is a little thing on the end to fasten it. That was missing. We tried to hold the sail, but there was no wind. We started to drift out to sea. We drifted and drifted. At the harbour entrance there are two big sand banks, which are dangerous. We drifted and became worried because the tide has not turned. By now, no one was in sight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
We looked for a flare. There was none. We kept paddling but drifted on to a sand bank. We were in about 18 in of water, so my hon. Friend the Member for Cynon Valley and I jumped out, heroes in the making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While my husband sat holding the thing that is used to point the boat in the right direction—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hampstead and Highgate)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rudder.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Golding</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, something else. We jumped out and pushed the boat, running along the sand bank laughing. My hon. Friend said, "Don't let go of the boat, because we could suddenly drop into very deep water."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the words came out of her mouth, we dropped into very deep water. The boat started to fill with water, because all the weight—the engine, my husband, my hon. Friend and myself—was on one side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The boat swung around and waves started coming off the sand bank, filling the boat even quicker. The drag was pulling us both underneath. If we had not been wearing life jackets we would have been in a much more serious position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My husband grabbed us at either side. He swears to this day that he was working out who had the biggest majority. However, he pulled in my hon. Friend the Member for Cynon Valley, which of course filled the boat even further, and, with enormous difficulty—the drag was very strong—they managed to pull me in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I looked for the thing to scoop the water out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The bailer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Golding</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the word. I whipped my hon. Friend's hat off and started bailing with it. The other two struggled to turn the boat round to prevent the water from coming in and filling the boat as fast as I was trying to empty it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We eventually drifted on to the shore, where my husband was sent off to get petrol—it being a man's job to get petrol—from a petrol station across the sand dunes, about four miles away. Fortunately, he got a lift. When he returned, we filled up the tank and sorted everything out. By then, we were extremely cold. Then we had to return into the bay to go round to get into the harbour. I later heard that the sand bank was full of that stuff—I cannot think of its name—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Merchant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sharks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Golding</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the stuff that sucks people down. [Hon. Members: "Quicksand."] Yes. It really was frightening. When we eventually returned, we found that my hon. Friend's husband had been sitting on the balcony, watching our exploits. We had been out for six hours rather than two, and when we asked him whether he had been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0030">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
worried about us, he said, "Not at all. It's a lovely day, the sea is flat calm, and I could see the boat. No problem."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is, what was "reasonable" in that instance? Was it reasonable for my hon. Friend to leave the boat in that condition, where it was accessible to people who wanted to go out into the bay? I do not think that "reasonable" is a good word to use. Adventurous children who saw a boat might use it, thinking that it was a reasonable thing to do especially if, like us, they thought that they were safe because they were wearing lifejackets. The only good thing was that we caught a mackerel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury will forgive me, I shall join in the chorus of condemnation for the amendment. However, let me first thank the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mrs. Golding) for her graphic description of the policy formation process in the new Labour party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point about what is reasonable is overlaid by the fact that we are trying to produce a Bill that will provide not a reasonable but an absolute degree of safety for young people. I accept that we can never, as law-makers, reach an absolute, but we are charging the Minister with the duty of producing regulations that aim to get as close as possible to the absolute of safety. We do not want to send the wrong signals—they are no more than signals, because it will be the Minister in the first instance who decides what is reasonable—to the Minister and the licensing authority regarding the degree of weight to give to the concept of reasonableness compared with the concept of safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologised on Second Reading that my only experience of matters dealt with by the Bill was with rock climbing, many years ago, when my shadow occupied a considerably smaller area of ground than it does now. I know from that experience that reasonable precautions to take on sandstone one day are entirely inadequate the following day. Reasonable precautions when climbing on gritstone are entirely different from reasonable precautions when climbing on limestone. From my experience in my constituency, I know that what are reasonable conditions for climbing in the Avon gorge on one day are completely different on another day when climbing is, rightly, completely banned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that if the Committee decides to import the legal fiction of reasonableness into what are signals to the Minister and to the licensing authority, we shall be confusing our message. I hope that my hon. Friend will reconsider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Jim Spicer 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dorset, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the use of the word "reasonable" in this context because in the discussions that will take place, the Minister and the team of people who he will designate to speak on behalf of ourselves and those in the industry will be reasonable people who want to see rogues outlawed. We must not spend too much time thinking that there are people who are seeking ways of getting round the measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Jim Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not many. We are dealing with a minority. The industry will approach the Bill with an open mind, wishing to see the imposition of reasonable measures for safety. It is impossible, in the context of outdoor adventure training, to be prescriptive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A situation has been described today of going out in an boat and running out of petrol. That will happen. Surely we shall not say that every boat must be inspected and that anybody whose tank is not full of petrol will be denied his licence for the rest of the year. We know that that would be impossible. Every day problems arise with outdoor activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we try to over-prescribe, we will bump up against the very problem that my hon. Friend the Minister had in his mind when this excellent Bill was introduced: that we will destroy the main elements of the Bill. That is my concern, as someone who has been involved in practical, outdoor activities for 55 years at least.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Merchant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, have considerable concerns about the use of "reasonable", which puts me in a quandary because the amendment is grouped with amendment No. 25, which stands in my name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main concern about the use of "reasonable" is that, while it is a well-used legal term, it is subjective. What one person considers to be reasonable, someone else may not. We should not leave too much flexibility in the regulation-making powers, as I mentioned earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can imagine a situation in which, in the eyes of one person, a light touch is applied to regulations in an attempt to be as reasonable to as many people as possible. By doing so, he may enable someone to be reckless—not deliberately seeking to take risks, but not applying sufficient care and thought to the activity over which he has control—resulting in reckless behaviour, which can lead to a tragedy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard a most graphic description by the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme. She is clearly an accomplished yachtswoman who, nevertheless, contrived to find herself, as it were, up the creek without a paddle. We all know how easy it is to do that. I suspect that there is not an hon. Member present who has not, at some stage, found himself or herself in difficulty in water, whether swimming, in a boat, or whatever. At one moment one can feel totally relaxed, in control and be enjoying the activity, and then one suddenly has a feeling of panic when one thinks that the situation is getting fast out of control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a strong swimmer and I like to think that I can swim more or less anywhere there is water. Nevertheless, one can suddenly find that one is potentially in difficulties when one least expects it. That is what the Bill is about. It will help to prevent people from becoming over-confident in the face of a risk that is far greater than they originally thought it might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0031">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
I agree with what my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, West (Sir J. Spicer) said about maintaining the purpose of such activities. By their very nature, they must encompass an element of risk. We should not sanitise activities by removing all risk; that would make them worthless. There is a difference however, between a measured risk within limits and allowing an activity to take place when potential recklessness or negligence is involved. The Bill attempts to take account of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 25 relates to the two words that I discussed in my earlier amendment—"may" and "shall". Therefore, I shall not discuss the amendment in great detail except to say that it is important that even if the regulations are flexible, they have regard to inspection and safety. That is what clause 1(3)(c) is about. It refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the conditions subject to which licenses are granted". It refers also to inspection and to paragraph (b), which bears on safety.</p></blockquote>
The Bill should contain as strong a requirement as possible to ensure that regulations are introduced on safety and inspection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we do not do that, I wonder what the Bill's purpose is. I find it difficult to imagine that there is an argument for not including regulations on inspection and safety. There is no harm in toughening the requirement in the Bill and making it mandatory rather than permissive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Streeter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to refer briefly to the use of the word "reasonable". I have spent most of my professional career either writing "reasonable" into commercial agreements involving the buying and selling of private limited companies or striking it out depending on whether one was the buyer or seller.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two implications of inserting "reasonable" into clause 1(3)(b). First, it will act as a dampener on any extreme prescription by those writing the regulations. It will serve to guide them that Parliament has said that the provisions must be reasonable. Therefore, one might imagine that the word would add something to the clause. However, the second implication reflects my fears. As I said to my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury, the real significance of "reasonable" is that it will not create a subjective test, but an objective one. It will give a third party the opportunity to decide whether something is or is not reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the rule of law, the only third parties that we have in this country are the courts. My worry is that some courts are increasingly taking it upon themselves to second guess Parliament. That has always been the case, but the trend is increasing. I worry about that because the European Court of Justice, which might rejoice in the name of the supreme court of Europe, is increasingly having cases referred to it from this country for a second guess. That is not to be welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I prefer duly elected Members of Parliament to make decisions. Ministers, who are accountable to the House of Commons, should have ultimate accountability for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
regulations. Although it may disappoint my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury, I oppose the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is one of those dangerously seductive amendments that have the characteristics of being desirable and reasonable. However, listening to the debate has given me cause for doubt. A string of questions has been raised, not all of which have been satisfactorily answered. My hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury may want to do that shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was concerned by my hon. Friend's underlying assumption that those concerned with law making and the process of drafting regulations are extremists and maniacs who wish to produce mechanisms that are completely unworkable and unacceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, there is some evidence of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that there is evidence to support that. Perhaps she will give us that evidence. It might sway the debate. I have spent some years in the foothills of Government, so I am not completely impartial. However, I submit that everyone involved in the process starts out with good will and a desire to do what is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not my hon. Friend the Minister in danger of straying into the argument which runs along the lines of, "I am from the Government and I am here to help you"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would go even further than my hon. Friend. I would say, "I am from the Government. Trust me totally." If I thought that comment were sufficient, I would finish my speech now. However, the Committee probably requires a few more words from me to allow it to judge the nature of the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must start from the presumption that parliamentary draftsmen, civil servants and, may I suggest it, Ministers of the day will want to work on the Bill to make it workable and practical. That leads to the question whether the insertion of "reasonable" repetitively through a Bill will give the Bill any more effectiveness or will constrain those who draft the regulations. If that were so, "reasonable" would appear everywhere in every Bill. If the word has any strength or effectiveness, it would be used as standard practice. However, that is not the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilboyle) not unreasonably asked, who will judge the meaning of the word? My hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury has given a worrying reply. If we are not careful, we shall drag ourselves and everyone else much more quickly on the road towards judicial review. We shall expect the courts to intervene ever more frequently to make their objective, third-party judgments on what is "reasonable" should the word appear frequently throughout the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would go further. If we want such comfort, why do we not include another provision—it is a pity that I did not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0032">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
think of tabling such an amendment—that would state that every element of the Bill shall demonstrate popular support? That is a pretty reasonable request that we could add to the Bill to ensure that it is acceptable in a democratic and accountable society. I do not expect anyone to entertain that view, but it would provide a similar form of comfort factor as that offered in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was persuaded by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West when he clearly pointed out that the concept of reasonableness can vary depending on the different circumstances in which it is being applied. I am not sure that putting the word in the Bill would have the effect required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 25 deals with our old friends "may" and "shall". I was tempted to approach the amendment by saying that I did not have the same concerns about it now as I had previously. However, I offer the Committee this thought. It is possible, not likely, that in future an inspection regime would no longer be required. In an ideal world that would be the case. As the Bill's promoter made clear—and we all agreed—in the initial stages, and perhaps as far as the eye can now see, an inspection regime of some sort will be required to ensure levels of safety in activity centres. Yet, at a future date, it is not inconceivable that it may be judged that an inspection regime will not be required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accepted the form of words suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham and the Act stated that there "shall" be inspection, there would be no possibility of removing the inspection regime other than by primary legislation. We always argue rightly in such cases, that everything written into the Bill is then set in parliamentary concrete because primary legislation is necessary to remove or amend it. It is better to practice in such cases to allow some flexibility within the framework of the legislation to permit proper changes, modifications and adaptations to be made in time, and with a change of circumstances. For those reasons, I urge the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has reinforced the overwhelming concern of members of the Committee about safety. My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme painted a wonderful picture of her own exploits at sea. I noted her detailed knowledge of the sea and yachts: she used phrases such as "the little things at the end", "the holes in the side" and "the stuff that suck you down".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that people will occasionally put their own lives at risk. How much more likely is it, then, that someone running a centre where the profit motive is to the fore—sales before safety, as the judge in the St. Alban's case remarked—could put children's lives at risk?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aylesbury asked for insights into safety matters. I have made these points before, but I shall
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
do so again as he has specifically asked for them. There is a matter of reasonableness in respect of safety; it is whether we strike a balance between activities that are exciting and adventurous and those that are dangerous and life-threatening. That seems to be the distinction between reasonable and unreasonable standards of safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the hon. Member for Aylesbury think it reasonable that the instructors who went out from the St. Alban's centre lacked the proper qualifications for the task? Was it reasonable for the centre manager to send a party of wholly inexperienced canoeists paddling across water that proved to be very dangerous that morning? Was it reasonable that the instructors did not know how to inflate the life jackets? Many of those are commonsense aspects of what is, and is not, reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Sutton, who temperately drew aside the veil from the nefarious world of lawyers, suggesting ways in which lawyers and courts could use the word "reasonable". It could be used to the advantage of those wishing to circumvent the law and safety provisions. The hon. Member for Dorset, West spoke of centres that try to avoid the law. He is right in his assertion that the majority of centres wish to abide by the law because, if for no other reason, it is in their commercial interests to run centres whose activities are safe for people to enjoy so that they return. However, we all know that a number of centres are not reasonable in their understanding and interpretation of safety, as the recent Health and Safety Executive report made clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view, the word "reasonable" in amendments Nos. 1, 3 and 2 would not help the Bill and might even create loopholes through which people could in future wheedle their way. Amendment No. 25, which is in the name of the hon. Member for Beckenham, proposes the use of the word "shall". I am fairly relaxed about it, but I wonder whether it might constrain some of the debates on statutory instruments. The hon. Member for Aylesbury said that scrutiny by statutory instrument Committees is sometime—I cannot quite recall the word—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Less than thorough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, less than thorough, or superficial. I was about to say that when a statutory instrument debate on this subject comes before the House it would be proper for us to scrutinise it carefully and thoroughly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been useful to explore these issues. Two charges levelled at my amendments were that I had insufficient confidence in the rationality of those who frame secondary legislation and that the amendments would create loopholes that could be exploited by rogue operators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is common ground that we all expect Ministers and their official advisers to act reasonably and dutifully. It is also common ground that, by and large, they do so to the best of their ability. One does not, however, have to be an unquestioning admirer of Mr. Christopher Booker to realise that there are occasions when the zeal to regulate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0033">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
runs ahead of the real needs of society for such regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not study newspapers that are critical of the party that I support, so I turned to today's edition of 	<i>The Daily Telegraph.</i> I recommend that my hon. Friend the Minister consider the warning note that it sounds. It states that even Governments who are determined on deregulation sometimes find that, in responding to difficult cases, they go that little bit further than can be justified on reflection and that this can sometimes store up trouble and unanticipated side-effects perhaps one or two years later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other criticism of my amendment was that it gave opportunities to rogue operators. As I anticipate the amended system working, it would be rather more difficult than my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Lady Olga Maitland) assumes. I propose that the test apply to the Minister's regulation—making power. It would not be a test that would bite directly on the enforcement powers of the licensing authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an operator wished to challenge a regulation as unreasonable within the terms of the amendment, the operator would have to make a choice. He could either wait until the licensing authority produced a list of conditions and say, "I refuse to abide by the Minister's regulations, which are unreasonable." In such circumstances, the licence would, I imagine, be withheld, with a consequent effect on customers of that centre while the challenge went through the courts. Alternatively, recourse to the courts could be had as soon as a regulation was published and enacted by Parliament without waiting for the licensing authority's implementation. I do not believe that the loopholes are quite as was suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, having listened to the arguments, and having been reminded that not only the Executive branch but the judicial branch of the constitution can sometimes act in ways unanticipated to the point of eccentricity, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment and trust the Bill's promoter and my hon. Friend the Minister to act reasonably and strike the right balance. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 would remove from clause 1(3)(b) the reference to "other facilities". The amendments are probing and I have a number of questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
Why is the reference to other facilities necessary? This is one of the occasions on which I worry that regulations made under a general enabling power will be applied to operations which the Bill's supporters, regardless of their party affiliation, did not intend. The Bill deals with facilities for adventure activities. Why, therefore, is it necessary to refer to other facilities? What other facilities does the hon. Member for Devonport have in mind?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are not other activities of a recreational, sporting or leisure nature already dealt with by health and safety legislation? Is it necessary to bring them within the scope of the Bill? Is not there a risk in the wording of clause 1(3)(b) that certain operations will have to put up with unnecessary duplication of form filling, certification and inspection?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We already know that that has happened over the years with fire inspection. There are civic buildings in my constituency that need a set of fire licences from the fire service and another couple of sets from the district council, because a different inspection under a different set of rules is required for the different purposes for which the buildings are used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is not there a risk that the same will follow in respect of this Bill? A centre offering, for the sake of argument, hotel facilities and unadventurous outdoor activities such as golf, may have to undergo one set of inspections and safety checks under existing health and safety legislation only to discover that not only its adventure centre, but its other facilities, which it had operated before the legislation came into force, also needed to be inspected by the licensing authority set up by the Bill and other relevant statutory bodies. I would like reassurance on those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to refer to amendment No. 40. To refresh the Committee's memory, the amendment would insert the words

I would like to dwell on the importance that I place on first aid provision and rescue facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was fortunate in a particular instance. I shudder when I think of the total confidence I had when I allowed my then 15-year-old son to take part in a Royal Navy exercise. He was taken on a frigate to the North sea in wild, tossing waters, lifted by a helicopter, swung on the end of a rope and dumped heartily into the sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to say that my son was well equipped, wearing a life jacket and a dry suit—he was totally safe. When I think back, I am horrified because it never occurred to me to quiz the Royal Navy about its safety procedures and first aid procedures to be implemented should things go wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was lucky. My son was in expert hands and came home
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0034">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
excited and exhilarated. The experience was of great benefit. However, there is another side to the equation, as we have learnt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have read of the things that went wrong in the Lyme bay tragedy. It was interesting that the Select Committee on Education brought out a report, "Safety in Outdoor Activity Centres" which pointed to core first aid and safety procedures. More than that, it is worth re-examining the report into safety in outdoor activity centres issued by the Health and Safety Executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report is damning in the extreme. People may have already examined it, but we should refresh our memories of why it is so important for first aid to be given a higher priority rather than being taken for granted. The HSE mentions that 24 per cent. of the 200 centres that it examined failed in their safety policy and organisation. Only 13 per cent. failed in their risk assessments; 8 per cent. had poor emergency procedures while 6 per cent. had poor instructor training and competence procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme made valid points about maintenance of equipment. The HSE report emphasises her remarks: 6 per cent. of the centres had poor standards of equipment maintenance and, crucially, 8 per cent. had a poor system of reporting accidents while 6 per cent. had a poor record of monitoring safety standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those may seem to be dry statistics, but when translated into human terms they are a different story. The Select Committee asked a number of people to give evidence. The story of Hayley Hadfield is tragic and exemplifies why we should be very clear about what we mean by first aid and rescue procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The story of Hayley is distressing in the extreme. I spoke to her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Peter Hadfield, who live in Salford. Their daughter, aged 11, died in May 1992 after attending the Manor adventure centre in Craven Arms, Shropshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The story is harrowing. Hayley went on a three-day holiday at the centre with children from her school, accompanied by a teacher. One evening they were taken for a forest walk when it was almost dark. The instructor told her group that they must climb down an almost verticle embankment. It was steep.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hayley and two other girls refused. They were terrified. The instructor went ahead and shouted, "You must come down or you'll be left up there on your own." The girls tried to slide down, clinging to trees. Hayley however, lost her grip and hurtled out of control until she hit a tree head first. She was knocked out and blood began to pour from an ear. What happened next was even more distressing: no one knew what to do. The instructor knew no first aid, but a 12-year-old boy knew a little and tried his best. The instructor managed to make his way to a house, where he made a telephone call—not for a doctor or an ambulance, but back to the centre to ask for the minibus to be sent out.
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
It eventually arrived, but with no stretcher or first aid equipment. The girl was hauled up the embankment and finally into the bus, but it could not start because it was stuck in the mud. Everyone had to get out, to heave the bus out of the ruts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Back at the centre, the managing director said, "I am not getting involved because I am off duty." Finally, Hayley's school teacher rang for an ambulance, horrified that one was not waiting. It was three hours before Hayley, with severe head injuries arrived in hospital. All the time, the hospital had an air ambulance on standby. It could have been at Hayley's side within 10 minutes flat. Young Hayley died three days later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the coroner's inquest, the verdict was that Hayley died through "lack of care". The Crown Prosecution Service took no action. But finally—I pay tribute to this—the Health and Safety Executive pushed for charges against the instructor, who was unqualified, managing director and centre. The centre and the managing director were each fined £15,000. The centre is still open and operating to this day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer again to the remark by Hayley's mother to me. She said that the difficulty is that first aid and rescue instructions are not sufficiently clear and must be prescribed. Had that been so, she felt keenly that young Hayley would have survived.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another case put to the Committee is also relevant. In her submission, Mrs. Stephanie Trotter described how her 12-year-old son fell from a rubber-tyre swing on to his head. Although she did not blame the activity centre for the accident she was severely critical of the lack of correct first-aid knowledge. Her son was given totally inappropriate treatment, which could have had disastrous results. He was put to bed and left unattended for several hours. He then developed a blood clot on the brain which, mercifully, a successful operation at the Atkinson Morley's hospital put right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Had the centre acted properly and appropriately, had known first aid and exactly what to do, that boy may have received treatment more quickly. A blood clot on the brain can leave a person paralysed for life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well to say that we should be reasonable and embrace provisions in a whole package. However, there is a strong argument for being clear about exactly what we mean by first aid and rescue facilities. We must avoid a repeat performance of Hayley's case, with an instructor calling for a minibus. He should have had a mobile telephone. He should have dialled for the hospital and Hayley could have lived.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Goulding</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam. I have a story with a happier ending than the stories that she related to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My husband went fishing on a lake with a large group of friends. They had paid a considerable amount of money and were all fishing happily. One of my husband's friends said "There are fish over there. We will get in the boats," which were provided at the lake, "and row out." He put the oars in the rowlocks, pointed the sharp edge towards the lake and started to row.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As they got out into the lake, the boat was sinking. My husband's friend was rowing vigorously and had not noticed that the boat was sinking. It sank, while my husband was shouting to his friend, who did not hear, that the boat was sinking. The boat overturned and hit my husband's friend on the head and knocked him unconscious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My husband, who could not swim but who was wearing a life jacket, turned for the shore. The fishermen on the shore were shouting "Tony, Tony. Turn back." He turned around and his friend was face down in the water, unconscious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My husband, wearing all his fishing gear, and with his Wellington boots full of water, somehow managed to get his friend to the shore. One of the fishermen, who was fortunately an experienced first aider, gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. My husband's friend was still unconscious but they managed to get him to a hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was at home and 	<i>The Daily Telegraph,</i> which has already been mentioned in Committee, rang me to say that the accident had occurred. Being a good politician, and not having been at the scene of the accident or knowing the circumstances, I naturally made up a good story on behalf of my husband.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that, since my husband could not swim, I was quite certain that his friend had rescued him and brought him to the shore, and I said how brave he was. As a result, my husband's friend received an award from the Royal Humane Society for rescuing my husband. My husband received nothing. The man who had given the life-saving first aid received a Royal Humane Society certificate. When I asked why had not jumped into the water to help my husband's friend, he said, "I had on my new Damart and I did not want to get it wet." There is no justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
The boat was not fit for use and it should not have been on the lake. When Tony complained to the fishery about the state of the boat, they told him that the boat was perfectly all right—and he was banned for life for bringing the fishery into disrepute. That seems incredible. That is the attitude of some of the people who operate such facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was said that boats should be examined. All boats for hire should have MOTs. Every year, every boat that is hired out ought to be inspected and granted a certificate of sea or water worthiness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the amendment because, if there had been a life belt available to help my husband to get his friend out of the water, that would have been extremely useful. The attitude of the fishery was, that was not their responsibility. When my husband rang about his friend's clothes, the fishery said "Did you know that we had an emergency here? Get off the phone." He said, "Yes, I did know." The reply was, "You can't have done. The cow has only just started to calve." What sort of attitude is that to someone who could have lost his life?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wolfson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With due courtesy, the anecdotal evidence related by the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme has no direct bearing on outdoor activity centres.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Golding</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are facilities for fishing at outdoor activity centres and boats are used. That should be taken seriously, considering the increasing use that young people make of lakes and fisheries. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wolfson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady, perfectly properly, reacts to that point. I am aware of the use that outdoor activity centres make of boats. I have been deeply involved myself. My point was that in the circumstances described by the hon. Lady, the organisation providing the service—in one case, a friend of hers—would not be caught by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No, 40, in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam, I am not entirely convinced that its addition, in the form that she suggests, would be of value. However, I strongly support her emphasis on knowledge of safety procedures and first aid as an integral part of the training, system and running of outdoor activity centres. The follow up after an accident is just as important as doing everything possible to ensure that accidents never happen. If they do, knowledge of the procedures for dealing with them is vital. I could not emphasise that more strongly, from my own experience of such situations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely endorse the motives behind amendment No. 40, but I am not sure that it would produce the result that the hon. Member for Sutton and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0036">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
Cheam seeks. If we made the amendment, it might be deemed that the first aid provision was fulfilled by having a first aid box on the premises, and that rescue facilities meant a rope ladder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the tragic story of young Hayley, surely the management of the outdoor activity centre was at fault in failing to employ someone who was adequately trained to put in charge of taking young people for a night walk in the forest, something that could be of immense interest and value to them, not least because of the wildlife that comes out only at night—the furry kind. The accident was a direct result of the instructor's lack of knowledge of first aid and of how to persuade young people to attempt something that contained an element of risk—going down the escarpment, in this case—rather than frightening them into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I endorse the thrust of the amendment, but I am concerned that it would not produce the result that the hon. Lady desires. It could leave those who are less than scrupulous in the management of their activity centres without the essential requirement that their employees must meet strict training standards before young people are entrusted to their care day or night.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Jim Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam for raising the matter of first aid. There is no doubt that the most crucial time when an accident happens—whether it be a heart attack or a fall—is the first 10 minutes or quarter of an hour. If matters are dealt with properly in that time, a life may be saved and not, tragically, lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unbelievable that a properly run centre could not include in its standard instructions the requirement that an instructor must be properly trained for such an emergency. When an emergency arises, people will not always respond in the right way—that does not apply only to outdoor adventure centres. There have been two or three heart attacks in the Westminster gymnasium. Thank goodness the instructor there dealt with that properly, and a life was saved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fleshing out the Bill to make it work, it is inconceivable that the Minister and the people whom he appoints will not emphasise the need for proper first aid instruction. As has rightly been said, that does not mean sticking a first aid box on the wall and claiming that that is sufficient to deal with any emergency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Training is the essence of the matter. We have failed, over the years, to ensure that even those who have completed a university degree in physical education, for example, are properly qualified to instruct. They are trained in the theory, and do a certain amount outside, but those young people must do much more before they are properly equipped and have the confidence to deal with other young people in the kind of situations that we are discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is undoubtedly an important area of the Bill. I find it difficult to decide whether it is advisable to include the words that were suggested by my hon. Friend
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
the Member for Sutton and Cheam. On balance, it is probably unwise to include them, and I shall try to explain why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that there is a technical difficulty, which is that to include a reference to rescue facilities gives rise to the possible danger of a confusion, duplication or overlap between what we want to do for activity centres and the existing provisions for more clearly-defined rescue facilities—for example, lifeboats and the fire brigade. That risk of duplication could be problematic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more important point concerns first aid provision. What gave me most doubt was when my hon. Friend said in her graphic description of the tragic events that, if only the instructor had used his mobile telephone and called the ambulance, the tragedy may not have occurred. I then asked myself why there was no reference to mobile telephones in the amendment. If they are so important—I should have little difficulty in persuading the Committee that they are—perhaps we should include in the Bill a requirement for the instructor to have available at all times a mobile telephone in working order, secondly, a requirement for the instructor to be properly trained'—my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, West made a valid point about that—and thirdly, a requirement for proper first aid equipment to be available at all times in an appropriate vehicle, backpack or whatever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is anticipating the consultation and the details of the regulations. I have no doubt that first aid provision will feature largely in the regulations that emerge after consultation. I realise that I am prejudging the position which is something that I asked the Committee not to do. I accept the thrust of the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam, but I am not sure whether the words that she used are right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we were to go down the road that my hon. Friend suggested, we would have to include a reference to mobile phones and we would have to bar an activity centre from operating in one of those parts of the country where the mobile phone cell network is not in working order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be most parts of the country where there are activity centres. I am already sorry that I mentioned it. Whether the reference that my hon. Friend wants to include would succeed in doing what she and all of us want to do is sufficiently doubtful for me to err on the side of caution and not include it at this stage. On balance, that is my recommendation to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury, the wording is intended properly to cover the different configurations of centre that we know exist—multi-activity centres or centres covering those who are aged under and over 18. I am advised that the wording in the Bill was intended to ensure that we would not unduly restrict the Bill at this stage. By using the term "other facilities", we thought that it would give sufficient flexibility to allow us to cover the activities of centres that did not fall neatly into our definition of outdoor activity centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0037">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
I concede that there is always a danger, as my hon. Friend pointed out, that we will go too far and give far too much scope to the draftsmen, over-exuberant civil servants and Ministers who want to spread the tentacles of regulations far and wide. At this stage, it would be advisable to keep the flexibility, given that we are at the early stages of an important objective, which is to bring a new safety regime to bear on centres, and when we do not know how many there will be or the variety of configuration that we may confront. My advice is to stick to the words on the face of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 14 would remove the words "or to other facilities". I want to flesh out some of the remarks that the Minister made. Adventure activities are defined on the face of the Bill as those that include some form of instruction and leadership and which are designed specifically for under 18-year-olds. It is possible that when more experience has been gained about the centres and inspectors visit them, other aspects of safety—I emphasise safety—may make it necessary to introduce regulations for areas that are not covered in respect of under 18-year-olds. There may be facilities that are specifically designed for over 18-year-olds or there may be facilities that do not involve instruction or leadership and it is inconceivable that an inspector would ignore aspects of safety in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the Minister's concern that the scope should not be too wide, but it is proper to legislate for those matters on which the teacher or parent, acting carefully, cannot make a reasoned judgment. On other matters, such as the quality of the food and hotel arrangements relating to convenience, not to safety, an adult can properly make decisions before sending a child to a centre. We must specify those matters on which it is difficult or impossible for a lay person to make an assessment. That is why the provision is included. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam graphically described the appalling case of Hayley Hadfield, with which I was familiar, of two and a half years ago. The way that the centre was managed was wrong. The problem was not the non-availability of rescue or first aid facilities, or trained first aiders, but management and the will to put in place a proper safety ethos. On Second Reading, several hon. Members spoke about the culture of safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, centres would sign a code of practice drawn up by the ACAC. There may be a successor body to advise the licensing body. In the committee's code of practice published last year, which is constantly updated, section 2.5 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Providers must undertake to instill in their staff an ethos which is conducive to safety."</p></blockquote>
	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A mobile telephone is ringing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand now why the hon. Gentleman referred to mobile telephones. It is unfortunate that they never fail to operate in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guidelines deal with safety. Section 2.8 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Providers must ensure that, whilst in their care, all groups of participants are accompanied by, or have ready access to, at least one responsible person with a current nationally recognised First Aid qualification."</p></blockquote>
Centres will have to sign up to such guidelines, which include that requirement for first aid facilities. The current ACAC documents do not require rescue facilities to be available. During the consultation process, consideration should be given to the question of including a reference to rescue facilities in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Committee to reject the amendment of the hon. Member for Aylesbury. Although I understand the concerns of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, inserting specific detail about first aid and rescue facilities would give them undue weight. The most important aspect is the management of safety, rather than specific safety issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his explanation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Merchant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 27, in page 2, line 12, after 'public,', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'and publication every six months,'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 57, in page 2, line 13, after 'licenses, insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'(which shall include the full names, addresses and dates of birth of licence holders, the date the licence was granted and the name or names of activity centres to which the licence relates).'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Merchant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 57 expands the objective of amendment No. 27, which is fairly narrow and straightforward. The objective is to be more specific about the requirement set out in clause 1(3)(j):
	<br><blockquote><p>"the keeping, and availability for inspection by the public, of a register of licenses".</p></blockquote>
It is important to keep a register of licences that is available to the public, and I am glad that will be included in the regulations that the Bill will empower the Minister to make. That is an important part of the public right to know and an important element of transparency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would make the Bill more effective and transparent in its operation and are in a wider sense an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0038">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
important part of open government, which I am glad is being increasingly applied. They would enable the legislation to be monitored effectively and properly; they would enable members of the public to take advantage of their right to know; they would provide transparency; and they would have an important deterrent effect. They would prevent unsuitable people from applying for and obtaining licences because their names would be in print for others to read.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process by which the granting of licences became open and public knowledge would deter those who might otherwise feel that they could get away with running an outdoor activity centre when they were reasonably widely known to be unsuitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 27 would extend the impact of clause 1(3)(j) by providing for the licence register to be published and made available every six months. The reason for that amendment is that, by itself, the keeping of a register, though important, can be an obscure process. It is important that a register be kept and made publicly available, but it is also important for it to be easily accessible. There is a danger that under the clause as drafted the register will be kept in one place—presumably, wherever the licensing authority is based, which could be anywhere in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The register might be kept in a remote location, such as befits outdoor activity centres, which would be difficult for a member of the public to reach to scrutinise it. Alternatively, the register might be kept in the capital, and people who wanted to check the information held on the register who lived a good distance away would be faced with a long journey to inspect it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any member of the public should have a right to obtain the register of licences by post or by consulting the local library. To enable that, the register should be printed and published. That should happen regularly so that the register does not become out of date—I propose that it be published every six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To draw a brief comparison, leaseholders currently have the right under various leasehold Acts to scrutinise bills, accounts and other documents related to the provision of services in their property. For example, if they live in a block of flats there may be common areas for which they pay a service charge each year. They have an absolute right to scrutinise such details, but the way in which the Act gives them that power means that leaseholders have to travel to a solicitor's office, freehold manager's office or managing agent's office to examine the documents. In practical terms, that deterrent considerably dilutes that right. Some of my constituents will have considerable problems with that because, for one reason or another, they may be unable to get to the office where that information is held.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The law says that that important information is available, but it prevents that right from being practically exercised. That would be all right if the office was near
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
where people lived, but, if it was far away, it might be impractical for the public to get there—perhaps because of the distance, cost or inconvenience. Some people may themselves have mobility problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of my experience in that area of the law, I do not want to see the same problem arising under the Bill. The information to be made available should be in its most accessible form—in other words, in a mobile form. It should be published and made available in the various ways that I described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 57 specifies in more detail the information that should be included in the register. Paragraph (j) is rather vague—it refers to a "register of licences", but it gives no indication of content. The linked amendment would include
	<br><blockquote><p>"the full names, addresses and dates of birth of all licence holders, the date the licence was granted and the name or names of activity centres to which the licence relates".</p></blockquote>
The name, address and date of birth simply ensure that the person is identified—the name for obvious reasons; the address to ensure that a specific person is described, as the name alone is not sufficiently descriptive; and the date of birth as a final measure to ensure that the person is specifically identified, because name and address are not always sufficient to ensure that. By adding the date of birth, one can be almost certain that one is not describing someone else. The chance of there being two people with the same name, address and date of birth applying for a licence is fairly slim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to know when the licence was granted. That would make clear how long the licence had been held. The name or names of activity centres to which a licence relates is important for obvious reasons. We would thus know who the people are, where they operate and a little about their background. Had I thought further, I might have required information to be held about the ultimate ownership of activity centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the majority of cases, that information will not be particularly relevant, because it will be about activity centres and licence holders who are entirely above board and in whom others will have placed trust. There will be no question of their competence to carry out the business of running activity centres. However, as we said earlier, the Bill seeks to deal with cases on the fringe—it seeks to prevent the problems that arise in the minority of cases where something has gone wrong. There is no doubt that in this business, as in any other, some activities could be described as being on the fringe. Those are the people against whom we must guard ourselves, which is why keeping information on licences is important. It is a difference and it allows transparency. For that reason, the clause should be strengthened. My amendments aim to do just that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has set the Committee a bit of a teaser. The argument about publication is finely balanced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
I shall deal with the simpler issue first. There is a technical problem with amendment No. 57, which seeks to spell out the details of licence holders. Some of the licence holders are corporate entities, so they will not have a date of birth. Such problems may be resolved, but that illustrates rather well the fact that such details are better dealt with after consultation. I suggest that it is not unlikely that we shall want more details, not fewer. My hon. Friend has made a good point, which we shall bear in mind. However, I am reluctant to tie us to the level of detail that he has suggested, irrespective of the glitch in the amendment's wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 27 is more important as it deals with accessibility. A balance of judgment must be made. My hon. Friend suggested that the register should be published every six months, but there are one or two problems with that, not least of which is the potential cost. That point should not be overlooked. There is also a risk in taking snapshots every six months. If something happens just after the finalisation of a report for a six-months period and after the report is published, the report will almost immediately be out of date. The Bill makes an outline suggestion that has yet to be fleshed out in detail. However, if we stick to that, it will create the possibility of always having an up-to-date record that can be accessed by people walking into the building, wherever that might be, or by those requesting extracts over the telephone or in writing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see why my hon. Friend wanted publication every six months, but I would place the balance of judgment with the words in the Bill. We can perhaps elaborate on them subsequently. No doubt we shall want to do that. The words in the Bill give us ample scope for keeping the record up to date and available for inspection. That can be fleshed out by the possibility of making extracts available or by creating other measures as we deem fit. There are precedents for that. We shall ensure that up-to-date information is fully and regularly available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The balance of judgment is fine. I advise the Committee to stick with the words in the Bill, which will be developed. We should not tie ourselves to six-monthly publication or to the level of detail that my hon. Friend suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we debated amendment No. 40, I gave the impression that the ACAC guidelines contained no reference to rescue. In fact, a sentence states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"All staff must be practised and competent in accident emergency procedures:"</p></blockquote>
The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Beckenham, particularly amendment No. 57, are highly tempting. I like amendment No. 57. It flags up the direction in which we should be going. Consumers—by that I mean parents, teachers and students—should have proper access to information about the centres and should know whether they are properly licensed. I agree with the Minister. Ultimately, I hope that considerably more information will be required to be given by Licensees, so that they provide information not only about those who run
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
the centres and where they are located, but about the sorts of activities undertaken and the risks involved. Most importantly, they must state that they abide by the code of practice and provide competent instructors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like school parties to be given ultimately a clear programme stating which activity will happen on which day; who, by name, will be in charge of the activity; and what skills and qualifications they have. Centres should provide such programmes perhaps a week or two before a party attends a centre. Although I am tempted by the amendment, I would go much further. I hope that the matters rightly referred to by the hon. Member for Beckenham and other issues will be covered by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want something far more comprehensive than the publication of a register every six months. The register of licence holders should be kept on a rolling basis. If a register were published every six months, it would, as the Minister said, become quickly out of date because centres could be added or, more importantly, removed from it. Six months could pass before the register showed that a licence had been lost because a centre failed to reach safety standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The licensing body should have a facility by which parents could contact it at any time to ask whether a centre has a licence. That would be a far more powerful way to supply information to consumers, and it is absolutely necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am tempted by the amendment of the hon. Member for Beckenham. I can understand that there are good reasons for it. The amendment has allowed the Committee to flag up matters that must be considered in the consultation procedure. I hope that there can be a more detailed debate of such matters under a statutory instrument some time later this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Merchant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been outdone. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister and the hon. Gentleman. They put my mind at rest. I had thought that the requirements of the clause were rather narrow. They want more details to be available than I proposed, which I welcome. I thought that I was being a bit demanding. I am glad to know that I was not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not intend six-monthly publication to be instead of a rolling register which is essential. I intended the six-monthly publication to be an additional measure. I am persuaded by my hon. Friend the Minister over that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During scrutiny of the regulations, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will bear in mind the point made about the difficulty of access to the register if it is kept in one place. Perhaps he will investigate the possibility either of having an on-line database or a facility for libraries in regional centres to carry a regularly updated copy of the register in addition to the main rolling register. In the light of my hon. Friend the Minister's remarks and those of the Bill's sponsor, the hon. Member for Devonport, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 2, line 14, leave out 'such'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 5, in page 2, line 15, leave out from 'authority' to 'and' in line 16.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 4 would amend paragraph (k) so that it refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the bringing of appeals to the Secretary of State against decisions of the licensing authority".</p></blockquote>
I want to give the Committee the opportunity to consider rights of appeal. It is worrying that the Bill provides for the fact that there will be circumstances in which there will be no right of appeal by an operator to the Secretary of State following a decision by the licensing authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek from the promoter of the Bill and the Government an assurance that, on the grounds of natural justice, a right of appeal will be provided when the consequences of a decision would put at stake somebody's livelihood, so that there will be a chance for the evidence to be re-examined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the principle that cowboys should be put out of business as speedily as possible, but it is also right that natural justice should be done. If people think that they have a reasonable case for arguing that the licensing authority is wrong, there should be a right of appeal so that the evidence can be reviewed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to emphasise the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury and to take that point slightly further. I find it difficult to accept that we are to pass a Bill which gives guidance on regulations, as clause 1 does, and which, even by implication, includes the principle that a non-elected body can take decisions which are not appealable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All our discussions this morning have been conducted on the basis that the clause gives guidance on subsequent consultations. It is important that that guidance makes it clear that we are not prepared to accept that there would be no right of appeal against decisions of the licensing authority which, whether in the view of the licensing authority or of the individual operator, would affect that operator's livelihood. I hope that the promoter of the Bill and my hon. Friend the Minister will view the amendment very sympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly concerned about recommending to the Committee that we accept an amendment which would introduce an absolute condition, but my concern may be the result, as I said earlier, of spending so long surrounded by expert advisers and failing to see the clarity of matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would make the Bill state that regulations may make provisions as to
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"the bringing of appeals to the Secretary of State against decisions of the licensing authority".</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friends have pointed out that the presumption would be that there would always be an absolute right of appeal against any decision of the licensing authority made under any circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible, although I would be hard-pressed to give an example of it now, that we might want to seek to constrain that in some way. For example we may want to deal with frivolous or repetitious appeals. We may want, in some way, to set a framework for, or limits on, the basis of appeals, although I do not anticipate that at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am being tentative because this is a sensitive matter. My judgment is that my hon. Friend need not fear that a sinister power will be seeking arbitrarily or unnecessarily to restrict the right of appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would result in the Bill making an absolute, bald statement. We know little at this stage about what will be the nature of the licensing body, the relationship it will have with operators of centres, the sort of decisions that it is likely to make and the nature of the appeals process. We may have some idea in our minds about how such provisions will work but, as yet, we are uncertain. Most of that information will be forthcoming in the extensive consultation process. I prefer the words to remain as in the Bill. I ask the Committee to resist my hon. Friend's amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is proper that natural justice must prevail in such cases. I draw to the attention of the hon. Member for Aylesbury that the licensing authority can only make decisions within the regulations. Therefore, appeals must be specified within the regulations. As the licensing authority will only operate within that framework, appeals can be heard only under the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury and I are saying that the regulations should not be restrictive in terms of the right of appeal granted under the regulations. By accepting the amendment, there would still be no barrier to the regulations—under which there can be no appeal against a decision that black is black. However, at least a clear signal would be sent to the licensing authority that, in framing its regulations and granting a right of appeal, it should be as unrestrictive as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The licensing authority can only act under the framework of regulations. If it deemed, for example, that black is white, that would not be in the Regulations that will ultimately pass through the House. It is only proper, that appeals can be heard only on those matters contained in the regulations over which the licensing body has power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still uneasy about the matter. I accept that my amendment is technically defective, but let us suppose that the licensing authority decides that, in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
particular circumstances, specified items of first aid equipment must be provided. I accept that would be a detailed decision, against which it would be silly to have a right of appeal to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the Government accept the principle that there should be a proper right of appeal when it comes to the possible refusal of a licence that would end someone's ability to make a living. Having listened to my hon. Friend the Minister and the hon. Member for Devonport, I hope and trust that they will continue to take seriously such assurances. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No.46, in page 2, line 21, leave out 'Secretary of State' and insert.
	<br><blockquote><p>'Health and Safety Commission; and before giving guidance under this subsection the Commission shall consult such persons (if any) as they consider it appropriate to consult.'.—	<i>[Mr. Jamieson.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> that the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 1 refers to the regulation—making power of the Secretary of State. Much hangs on the nature of the regulations, so will my hon. Friend the Minister publish his proposed code of regulations as early as possible before it is discussed in Parliament?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a pity if, as sometimes happens, the statutory instrument were tabled a fortnight before a debate in Committee Upstairs without giving people the chance to reflect on what will be an important code of rules. I ask my hon. Friend to operate a green code of statutory instruments, if there is such a thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the regulations will take account of voluntary organisations. I know that the hon. Member for Devonport has given much time and thought to that aspect. It is already hard for organisations such as the scouts and guides to recruit volunteer leaders. It is important that the leaders who take young people on potentially dangerous outdoor activities are properly skilled and qualified, but I hope that arrangements can be devised that do not cause scout and guide leaders to give up because of form-filling or the requirement that they must sit expensive courses in their own time, in addition to those that they are already obliged by their organisations to undergo.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee, and the regulations and Government guidance that will follow the enactment of the Bill, will make clear to parents and teachers the dividing line between the responsibilities of people in positions of leadership at activity centres and the responsibilities of those who act in loco parentis. I know that the hon. Member for Devonport has given much thought to the matter, which we discussed in the Select Committee on Education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most recent DFE guidance to schools and local
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
education authorities stresses that, even though the operator of an activity centre and the instructor in a specific activity are responsible for participating children, the teacher or other leader continues to be responsible in loco parentis throughout the visit to an activity centre, except while the children are taking part in a specific activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Merchant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 1 is the substance and meat of the Bill. Subsequent clauses may be debated quickly, and they will support clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will bear in mind the need to ensure that, under the regulations, persons who run and take part in instruction at activity centres are properly qualified. That will ensure proper standards and that suitable people supervise activities. That was continually referred to in the evidence that was submitted to the Select Committee's inquiry into safety in outdoor activity centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such standards are not currently assured, as there are no requirements for instructors and operators to reach a satisfactory level of qualification. I hope that, in drawing up the regulations, the Minister will ensure that children and others who go to outdoor activity centres are protected against the minority of instructors who have limited or no qualifications. During Second Reading, I mentioned people who come from abroad for summer holidays and get temporary jobs in such centres. Their qualifications are often non-existent or cannot be checked. I hope that regulations will take account of that gap in present practice and plug it securely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we will do as my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham has requested, because that is at the core of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury, the Bill will complete its Common's stages and then be dealt with by the other place. We hope and expect that it will then receive Royal Assent. During that time, we shall be able to do much preliminary work to frame the consultation document, which could be issued before Royal Assent, but certainly immediately after. A period of public consultation would follow and then the finalisation of regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the anxiety of all hon. Members, not least the Bill's promoter, to get the matter up and running as soon as possible. Nevertheless, we shall have to strike a balance between that and allowing Parliament properly to consider the detailed regulations and statutory instruments. I expect that that would be done; I see no reason why it should not be. Even if it meant waiting a little longer for implementation, I am sure that we all agree that it is more important to get if right first rather than rushing matters. I hope that I have reassured my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the amendments will start a brief debate on the nature of the penalties that should be available to courts. Amendment No. 16 would substitute a fine of £5,000 for the term "statutory maximum" on a summary conviction. Amendment No. 6 seeks to substitute 10 years imprisonment for two as the maximum sentence on conviction on indictment. Amendment No.7 would apply a prison sentence of five years as the maximum penalty for an offence under safety regulations on conviction on indictment. Amendment No. 12 would provide an accused person with the defence that he had exercised reasonable care in compliance with the conditions expected of him by the licensing authority. New clause 2 seeks to relate the Bill to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 16, 6 and 7 are about particular penalties. My slight fear is that the Bill may have made the penalties insufficiently heavy. The amendments suggest rather heavier penalties. I was interested to discover from the Bill's promoter what comparisons he bore in mind when preparing the Bill. Given the serious and tragic consequences of particular errors and cases of neglect by operators of activity centres, it is right that the penalties should be sufficiently severe to act as a deterrent. The amendments seek to make such deterrence more effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 12 seeks to shift the balance slightly by providing a defendant with a defence of reasonable care. It is important that people should not acquire a criminal record because they were let down or deceived by their employees—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
