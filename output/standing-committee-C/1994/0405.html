<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to call attention to the need to give adequate notice of amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments.</span></p>
<div class='clause'><span class='label label-warning'>clause</span>
Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
PROBATIONARY PERIOD FOR NEWLY QUALIFIED DRIVERS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Questioned proposed.</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Michael Clark <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rochford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: With your permission, Mr. Hill, before I deal with the detail of clause 1, I wish to say how grateful I was to the House for giving such a warm reception to the Bill on Second Reading on 3 February. More than two months have passed since then and that is sufficient time to discover all sorts of small, technical blemishes and, indeed, one or two bigger ones. The amendments tabled are a result of that.<br><br>
A glance at the amendment paper would suggest that my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Norris)—the Minister for Transport in London—and myself have done little else than consider amendments over the past eight weeks. I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for the assistance that he and his Department have given me in putting the Bill into proper shape. I am as convinced now as I was two months ago that the basic policy in the Bill is right and that the basic procedures will work.<br><br>
I do not have too demanding a task in this stand part debate. Clause 1 is an introductory clause, defining the Bill's scope. It is indispensable for understanding what follows. For the most part, the Bill is simple enough to understand. On the day on which a driver first passes a driving test in any class of vehicle, he or she becomes a "qualified driver". The two-year probationary period described in the Bill starts from that date. How the driver behaves during those two years is the subject of the Bill.<br><br>
If at any time during that period the driver's licence carries six or more penalty points, the provisions of clauses 2 and 3 come into effect. The driver is obliged to surrender his or her licence and is allowed to receive in exchange only a provisional licence and to drive under the conditions applying to learner drivers. For all learners, that means displaying L-plates and for a car driver it means being accompanied by an experienced driver.<br><br>
Obviously, motor cyclists do not need to be accompanied, but they will be restricted to lower-powered motor cycles as are appropriate for learner drivers. Moreover, their provisional licence is valid for only two years. They are then on and off the road for one year altogether before they can renew it. Therefore, for someone used to full-driver status, it can be quite a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
humiliation to revert to being a learner driver, but it is much less so than being disqualified totally. They are given the chance to improve and they can continue driving during that period provided that they abide by all the requirements of a learner driver.<br><br>
I should explain that because the probationary period begins on the first occasion of passing a test, it is not affected by any subsequent tests passed. Therefore, a driver who passes a motor cycle test in January 1996 and a car test in July of the same year will remain probationary only until January 1998—that is two years after passing the motor cycle test, which is the first test to be passed.<br><br>
The Bill will apply only to holders of British licences. However, British licences can be granted on the strength of certain driving tests taken outside Great Britain. The Bill needs to take them into account, too. Licences from Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and Gibraltar are readily exchangeable for British licences if a resident of one of those places moves to the British mainland. All those administrations use similar driving tests to ours. Under Community law, licences from all other member states are also exchangeable if the holder moves to an address in Great Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Elizabeth Peacock <span class='memberconstituency'>(Batley and Spen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend has studied this area of the Bill, but it is my understanding that those who have Irish and British driving licences can interchange. Someone could accumulate 12 penalty points, because he could have six on each licence, before becoming liable to retraining under the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Clark</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The Bill can be effective in this country only on a British driving licence, when the test was taken in this country and for the first two years following that test. I think that my hon. Friend's point was right; if it was not, my hon. Friend the Minister will correct me later.<br><br>
To return to the discussion of licences from other countries, the European economic area agreement of 1992 extends those benefits to certain other states. Three of them have joined the European Union, leaving only Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein outside. Subsection (3) of the clause is a necessary technicality because Liechtenstein has not yet ratified the EEA agreement, though it intends to do so when it has made the necessary changes to its legislation. One does not often see cars from Liechtenstein on our roads, but we obviously need to be clear whether they are covered by the scope of the Bill<br><br>
The point of all that is that drivers begin their probationary period on the day they pass their test, whether they took it in Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the offshore islands or in the various other European countries I have mentioned.<br><br>
I should reply again to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen (Mrs. Peacock), because I may have misled her. Looking at my notes, I see that the probationary period starts from when a driver passes a test, whether it was taken in Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the offshore islands or in various other European countries I have mentioned. However, my hon. Friend specifically mentioned the Republic of Ireland and, therefore, my answer was right. A different set of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0389">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
circumstances would have applied had it been Northern Ireland.<br><br>
Equally important is the fact that the probationary period will end on the second anniversary of passing the test.<br><br>
One question that may spring to mind is how the police and courts will know the date on which a driver passed a driving test in a foreign country. The answer is that all the countries' licences, either now or by 1 July 1996, will conform to the Community model and will show the date of entitlement in a prominent place. That is true even of licences from the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, although they are not part of the European Union. The EEA countries are also conforming to the model as part of their treaty obligations. When the holder of a licence from any of those countries exchanges it for a British licence, the date will be transferred to the British licence.<br><br>
Ideally, I would have liked to extend the Bill to other countries with licence exchange agreements with Britain, for example Australia and New Zealand. Many of us would feel that people from those countries were rather more likely to drive on our roads than people from Iceland or Liechtenstein. But I was advised that that would be too ambitious because those other overseas countries do not have the same sorts of licence, and when the licence is exchanged for a British licence it would not be possible to record the date which would commence the probationary period.<br><br>
It would be a little unfair to drivers from Australia and New Zealand if they were made to start a probationary period from the date they obtained a British licence, taking no account of the experience gained in their own countries. The only alternative was to leave them out altogether. The clause as it stands is therefore about as comprehensive as it reasonably could be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Rochford (Mr. Clark) on promoting the Bill. I am sure that all members of the Committee wish it a speedy passage.<br><br>
It is interesting to note that, over the past few months, there has been a rapid increase in the number of road safety issues raised by hon. Members from both sides of the House. My hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dun woody) spoke about heavy goods vehicles recently and there has been a spate of such debates, a few of which have resulted in moves in the right direction. Today, I hope that we are reaching the final stages of a narrow part of the changes necessary to improve safety on the roads.<br><br>
I hope that the Government will support other issues being promulgated at the moment. Several thousand deaths that occur each year in what are euphemistically called road accidents can be avoided. The Bill is a substantial step in the right direction. As the briefing from the Automobile Association states and as the hon. Member for Rochford said on Second Reading, young people are more likely to have road accidents—I am slipping into the misuse of that phrase.<br><br>
I sometimes think back on my own driving experience over nearly 30 years. For all my life, I have been in occupations that involve high mileage driving. The first accident that I had, back in the 1960s, was deemed not to be my fault. But, with the experience that I have now, I realise that it could have been avoided. If we are all
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
honest, we know that that is the case, and that we develop greater awareness of things that happen around us as we become more experienced. One tends to develop a broader vision around the vehicle which helps to avoid accidents.<br><br>
I have heard some criticisms of the Bill, but they tend to be from people who have the rather peculiar belief that, once they have passed the test, they suddenly become experts. Clearly, that is not so. I support the clause and the spirit of the Bill. I wish it a speedy passage. I hope that we can deal with the detailed changes rapidly and I hope to hear a positive statement from the Government about their persistence in getting the Bill on to the statute book.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Piers Merchant <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beckenham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you, Mr. Hill, to the Chair. I am pleased to be sitting on another Committee under your chairmanship. It was only a few weeks ago that we were in Committee with you chairing a different private Member's Bill. I know that you are a fair and tolerant but, nevertheless, firm Chairman and I am sure that you will display those characteristics today.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
I am a keen supporter of the Bill and I spoke on Second Reading. I should like to say a few words about the clause because it establishes the important new principle of probationary driver. It is an excellent idea and the other clauses are built on it. It brings into effect extra sanctions on probationary drivers for breaching road traffic laws.<br><br>
One or two points about the clause have been put to me since the debate on Second Reading. One issue is whether a probationary period of two years is right. Some people say, "Why two years? That is an arbitrary figure." That is correct. It would be possible, without altering the principle or the effect of the rest of the Bill, to have a probationary period of one year, three years, or some other arbitrary figure.<br><br>
I would defend the two-year period for probationary drivers. One year is too short. If one of the purposes of the probationary period is to establish experience, one year is too short. A longer period than two years, while it might have a practical effect in that it would further constrain drivers of limited experience, would be too onerous and would run the risk of making a mockery of the term "probationary period". For those reasons, despite misgivings that have been expressed to me, I think that two years is about right.<br><br>
One misconception that has been created by the probationary period, which was evident even on Second Reading, is that the clause is aimed at young drivers. That is not the case. The probationary period will apply to drivers of any age. While much attention has focused on the problem created by some young drivers, the question is not simply one of age—provisions covering age could have been written into the Bill if it had been so desired—but of inexperience. We focus on young drivers because these days the majority of new drivers happen also to be young.<br><br>
I can remember in the not too distant past—or perhaps it is rather distant—when I was a child, a large proportion of new drivers were quite old. I remember the headmaster of my school qualifying when he must have been 55 or 56. Within a few weeks of his qualification he bought himself a brand new Rover and within a few more weeks
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0390">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
the car was dented in many places. It was a great joke in the school that every time the headmaster arrived in his car it was bashed somewhere else.<br><br>
The point is that a driver who is newly qualified is, by definition, a much greater risk. That applies to elderly as well as young drivers. It is right that the clause should define a probationary period in terms of a period of time elapsing after qualification rather than being related to age.<br><br>
Another point that has been raised with me by some of my constituents, but which I have heard before, is whether the probationary period should be marked by more than a definition. In other words, a driver in his probationary period should carry some form of mark on his vehicle. One of my constituents said that a probationary driver should carry a green "P" on the front and back of his car. That puzzled me at first and I wondered what she was talking about, but then I realised that she was talking about a P-plate. That would indicate clearly to everyone that that driver was in a probationary period. I wonder if my hon. Friend the Minister will refer to that, as it has been widely discussed.<br><br>
The clause is significant in that it establishes a new class of drivers, who are fully qualified but who are not to be treated the same as other qualified drivers in law. The new category could be described as a halfway house. Therefore, the Bill establishes an important new principle. It is demonstrable from the accident figures that the chances of a driver's involvement in an accident in the proposed probationary period are far higher than those of a more experienced driver. That is the nub of the Bill: the theory on which it is based. The theory has been shown to be statistically accurate. A quarter of all fatal accidents occur when one of the drivers is newly qualified.<br><br>
The rest of the Bill covers drivers with convictions. Forty-two per cent. of young drivers with convictions have been involved in accidents. That is a phenomenal statistical indicator of the risks.<br><br>
Other reasons for a probationary period include experience. Good driving is a result of a combination of factors: techincal competence—the physical ability to control a car, experience, which is acquired only through time and familiarity with different circumstances in driving, and maturity. Maturity and experience are linked. Those three important factors underline the need for a probationary period as a yardstick by which other decisions can be made.<br><br>
Subsections (2)(b), (3) and (4) deal with drivers who qualify in other countries. I may not be able to follow the technical arguments that my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford understands. I belatedly congratulate my hon. Friend on the Bill—I apologise for not doing that sooner. I seek clarification about the Bill's impact on people who come to Britain with a foreign driving licence, which they continue to carry and do not exchange for a British licence under reciprocal agreements. The Bill should cover them. Everyone who drives on this country's roads should be subject to the same impact of the law.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will mention the theory test. Such a test would further equip probationary drivers to become good drivers. The idea has been widely canvassed; it has been discussed on a European level. My hon. Friend the Minister is an expert
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
on such matters. I hope that he can enlighten the Committee about the likelihood of a theory test and describe its impact on the Bill<br><br>
I support the balanced and sensible clause. The probationary period is a worthwhile proposal. It is widely supported and is backed up by all the figures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gwyneth Dunwoody <span class='memberconstituency'>(Crewe and Nantwich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I join other members of the Committee in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Hill. You are an excellent and helpful Chairman.<br><br>
The House of Commons owes a debt to the hon. Member for Rochford for promoting the Bill. I regret that the attitude towards death and disfigurement in road accidents is slightly ambivalent. There is no other way to inflict severe damage on another human being and be treated as lightly. Those who have seen much of the devastating effects of accidents on the lives of our constituents know how vital it is that road safety be regarded not as an add-on to some other action of life but as a fundamental responsibility.<br><br>
Anything that improves the standard and quality of driving in this country is to be warmly welcomed. The statistics show why such a change is so essential. With his usual highly efficient and responsible attitude, the promoter has not only produced something that will be of tremendous benefit to us all but has led the way to bringing about a fundamental change in our attitude to driving. I hope that the Bill will progress rapidly to the statute book. It is one that everyone who knows what happens daily on our roads will welcome. Any disagreements that arise will be only minor. The Opposition are not only happy to support the Bill but look forward to its taking effect in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Duncan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rutland and Melton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to all members of the Committee to see you so ably filling the Chairman's seat, Mr. Hill. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford on introducing the Bill. At a time when Parliament is so much under attack, rather more attention should be paid to the work of a Back Bencher in introducing such a useful measure.<br><br>
I take slight issue with my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham (Mr. Merchant), who said that this is about not just young drivers but new drivers who may be a lot older. Essentially the Bill concerns young drivers and it aims to address that problem by introducing a probationary period. A parliamentary brief from the Automobile Association contains a telling misprint; a title on one of its pages calls this the Road Traffic (Young Drivers) Bill when it is really the Road Traffic (New Drivers) Bill. That shows where minds have rightly turned. It is young drivers who need this probationary period and it is they who cause the problems that the Bill is designed to redress.<br><br>
Only a few weeks ago I was walking in the Lower Corridor and saw on the tape machine the announcement of the year's road death figures. I was pleased to note that the figures have fallen dramatically and are some of the best since records began. But around 4,000 deaths a year is too high a toll. It is not always the death of a driver; it may equally be that of a pedestrian. Over a quarter of those deaths are caused by drivers who are under the age of 21, which shows how essential it is to change the law to target our efforts on that category of young person that causes such a disproportionate number of deaths on the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0391">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
road. The young driver may get off with no more than a bruise because the car bonnet was between him and the pedestrian whom he so recklessly killed.<br><br>
I welcome the Bill absolutely. We should concentrate on the fact that the probationary clause will almost exclusively affect young drivers. It would be a waste of the publicity that can attach to this legislation if we did not make it clear that it is young drivers whom the Bill will affect. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham will not mind my pointing out a slight difference between my notion and his of the emphasis that should be given to the Bill.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(Warwickshire, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I join in the general welcome to you, Mr. Hill, in your chairmanship of a Committee that I am sure will sit briefly and happily; I know there is broad support among its members for the Bill. I think that this excellent measure will do much to improve driving. That is important not only because of deaths but because of inconvenience, delays and the social and economic costs that bad driving can cause.<br><br>
Many of the benefits of the Bill are likely to appear not immediately but over time, just as, since changes to the drink-driving law, it has proved to be today's young people who have adopted new attitudes and a different culture of drinking in relation to driving. They are far less willing than those of a generation ago to drink and drive. Perhaps the Bill will begin to change the culture of driving at speed without regard to other road users. Hon. Members have rightly said that the Bill applies to new drivers, but that concern has primarily attached to young drivers, who, it seems, often drive at speed. I hope that, over time—perhaps over a generation, but the quicker the better—there will be a change in attitudes towards driving at speed.<br><br>
Clause 1 deals with the scope of the Bill, on which subject I want to raise several points. Perhaps I should declare an interest as parliamentary adviser to the Police Federation of England and Wales, which has raised questions about the Bill. It broadly supports the Bill, but I want to ask the hon. Member for Rochford one or two questions about how he came to consider a probationary period for newly qualified drivers. What would be the impact of the two-year probationary period on newly qualified police drivers and on those of other emergency services? Is there a danger that operational restrictions will be imposed on officers who build up penalty points because of the way in which they carry out their duties—for example, if something goes wrong when they drive through a red light?<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman has decided on a two-year probationary period. When he was considering approaches to this issue, did he think about raising the age at which one may learn to drive from 17 to 18? What does he think about imposing a theory test on drivers in general—not just police drivers—who have built up penalty points and failed to get through the probationary period with their licence intact? Would not a written theory test be appropriate in any event for all drivers, rather than just a few questions asked during the driving test? Should training be mandatory for drivers during the probationary period?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
Some drivers feel that once they pass their driving tests they are highly skilled drivers. Of course, they are not. Would not it be appropriate that, perhaps during the two-year probation period, drivers should be obliged to undertake further mandatory training to improve their skills and to correct the bad lessons or careless habits learnt shortly after passing a test?<br><br>
I have been asked to raise those issues during the passage of the Bill and I hope that the Minister and the hon. Member for Rochford will address some of them.<br><br>
Finally, I congratulate the hon. Member for Rochford on putting an excellent private Member's Bill before the House and the Committee. In due course, many lives will be saved as a result of his efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Hawkins <span class='memberconstituency'>(Blackpool, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I also welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Hill, and congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford on his skill and perspicacity in bringing an excellent Bill before the House.<br><br>
I want to mention new drivers from different parts of the European Union. There is much in the news over the past few days that is relevant to what we are doing in Committee today. I learnt in this morning's papers that an enterprising driving instructor not far from my constituency in the north-west—in Wigan, in fact—is offering British driving tests to Germans as part of a package deal. They can fly into Manchester, stay in bed and breakfast accommodation in Wigan and take the British driving test because it is said to be easier than the German one. No doubt we shall have new drivers on the roads of Wigan and elsewhere who come from other parts of Europe. There have been inquiries, so the newspaper reports, from Italy, Spain and even America and Saudi Arabia, although drivers who fail tests in the latter two countries would not be covered if they passed in Wigan and returned later to their own countries.<br><br>
Yesterday's <i>Daily Mail</i> carried the description of a finally triumphant new driver who passed his British test in Bury St Edmunds at the 13th attempt. That driver is a Cambridge don and an old friend of my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) and me. Mr. O'Shaughnessy had spent more than £3,000 to have hundreds of lessons and 12 failures. The <i>Daily Mail</i> pointed out that he had finally passed, but, for the past several years, had managed to drive by building his own car as he is a lecturer in engineering at Cambridge university. He built a three-wheeler which qualified as a motor bike so that he had special permission to drive it around the roads of Cambridge so long as he carried an L-plate. He no longer needs that car now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend put it on record that our mutual friend Nicholas O'Shaughnessy is one of the most safe, meticulous and roadworthy drivers in the country?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to have my hon. Friend's support. On some future occasion, we may welcome Mr. O'Shaughnessy as a colleague. He was the prospective parliamentary candidate for the Swansea, East seat in 1983. He was sadly unsuccessful but would undoubtedly be an ornament to the House.<br><br>
I agree with the comments of hon. Members on both sides that my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford, with whom I worked for many years before coming to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0392">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
House, and who was kind enough to ask me to support the Bill, is undoubtedly bringing forward a most valuable Bill which will save lives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Peacock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Rochford will know that I was interested in road safety long before I came to the House. In 1983, as a new Member, I gained the opportunity to introduce a private Member's Bill. I was not quite sure what to do with it but I managed to get through the House the Road Traffic (Driving Instruction) Bill which closed a loophole and prevented trainee driving instructors from teaching young people to drive. We sent our sons and daughters to learn to drive at a driving school so that we did not pass on our bad habits, only to find that certain schools were using trainees to teach. The Bill gained Royal Assent in April 1984 despite being No. 20 in the ballot. Perhaps that was something of a record.<br><br>
A recent study by Southampton university, commissioned by the AA Foundation for Road Safety, showed that a significant number of young drivers—as many as 35 per cent.—could be categorised as unsafe. The Bill will affect only new drivers who are found to be unsafe by committing driving offences. It will not affect those who prove to be good drivers.<br><br>
In my view, motor vehicles and motor bikes are lethal weapons, especially in the hands of people without the experience to handle them. The number of young people not holding licences—some, the young teenagers, not even eligible for a licence—taking and driving away powerful, though sometimes small, cars, with terrifying results among communities where many innocent people have been killed, is a pointer to the experience that is needed to drive, especially to drive high-powered cars.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with the hon. Lady that cars and motor cycles should be regarded as lethal weapons. Does she agree that it is a pity that the structure of legislation governing road traffic offences does not have a parallel with other offences where handling a dangerous weapon is involved?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Peacock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept part of the hon. Gentleman's remarks. We have increased the penalty for taking and driving away, and for death resulting from that. We have not increased it as much as I should like, but I take a fairly strong view of people who take other people's lives. Not all my colleagues share that view. We could get even tougher, but we have moved a little.<br><br>
Further research at Southampton highlights the fact that many drivers do not drive unsafely because they lack the skills to drive well but because they choose not to use them. The Bill may help to focus their minds on the fact that they must use their skills to drive, or risk being penalised in the early days.<br><br>
The statistics on the life of a new motor bike are an eye-opener. I do not have current figures, but when I looked at them a little over a year ago I was horrified at the number of new motor bikes that ended up in pieces, with their riders, within six months of purchase. Thanks to good medical attention and technology, those youngsters survive, but are often disabled for life.<br><br>
A driving test is a test of competence to drive. Although I took my driving test more years ago than I care to tell the House, I recall that snowy day in December. After I had
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
taken the test, the examiner gave me a slip of paper which stated that I had passed; then he got out of the car and left me. I was not sure what to do. I had never driven without someone with me. I shall never forget that moment of panic, I thought, "What shall I do now?" It has stayed with me all the years. Afterwards, one collects one's thoughts and realises that one can drive. Perhaps many people do not have such doubts. They think that they can drive well, and they set off.<br><br>
We should think carefully about how to introduce newer drivers to motorway driving. Those of us who have driven on motorways for many years are aware of the complete change of driving habits that is needed and of the pressure of driving on motorways compared to driving in towns and cities. That is an important consideration for new, and especially young, drivers.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
In addition, the test of competence to drive would mean a test passed on any class of motor vehicle. For example, it could be a two-wheeled vehicle. I understand that the probationary period will not be extended or revised if a person later passes a test to drive a different class of vehicle. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will deal with that point. Switching from a motor cycle, even one that is high powered, to an even more high-powered four-wheel drive car makes a difference. The same would apply in a switch from a motor cycle to a minibus or Transit van.<br><br>
We must train drivers, especially new ones, to be not so aggressive in their driving. Those of us who drive in places such as West Yorkshire and then drive in London notice a complete difference. If one is not a little bit aggressive when driving in London, one will not get anywhere at any time of any day.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Merchant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that although aggressive and fast driving can be dangerous—I endorse her remarks on that—it can also be dangerous for a driver to be hesitant, unclear and too slow?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Michael Clark</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Dithering.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Merchant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, dithering as my hon. Friend says. Such driving is a problem, particularly at intersections. It can cause confusion and accidents. Normal drivers do not know how to react.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Peacock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that. Although nicely aggressive driving may be necessary in London and although fast driving is not necessarily unsafe—I know people who drive fast and who are safe because they have experience—there are those who dither at crossroads, junctions and traffic lights. I followed such a driver this morning. It was most infuriating. He seemed to take 10 minutes at every road junction before he decided what to do.<br><br>
Aggressive driving by both new and experienced drivers can be the cause of accidents. I know that only too well, having suffered a nasty accident many years ago as a result of someone's aggressive driving. It was only because my son and I were wearing seatbelts that we were not very badly injured. The accident resulted from the sheer aggression of someone who could not be bothered to wait for the traffic lights to change before he went through the junction.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0393">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
We must try to embody all good driving practices in the probationary period. Those who flout them will realise that they must go back and learn to drive again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Transport in London, (Mr. Steve Norris)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I assume the usual felicities to the Chairman? They are as sincere on this occasion as on any other. I shall move straight to congratulating my hon. Friend the member for Rochford.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is normal to wait until the end of a Bill before we extend such felicitations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is just that one is accustomed to the usual sycophancy from hon. Members seeking easy treatment from you, Mr. Hill. I realise that, in your case, such felicitations make no difference whatever and that is why I dispensed with them. Your fairness would extend to even my infelicity.<br><br>
While felicities are in the air and as my hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen has shown, I must inform my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford that obtaining a place in the ballot for private Members' Bills does not necessarily mean unalloyed joy. After the initial excitement, comes the choice of picking a title for a Bill. It is no secret that Departments of State will suggest areas where an hon. Member's interest might not be unrewarded. My hon. Friend was kind enough to look with favour at a concept that I discussed with him and which forms the basis of his Bill, but I should say that since he has taken the Bill on—it was evident on Second Reading—he has taken to heart the principle behind it. He has been extraordinarily assiduous in testing ideas and questioning myself and my excellent officials about how the Bill could be integrated into road traffic law. That takes some doing and I congratulate my hon. Friend. He has done us all a great service and, on behalf of every motorist, I am grateful to him.<br><br>
We have had an interesting debate on clause stand part, quite properly because the clause introduces the concept of the probationary period into an area that is of great concern to us all. I shall deal with the specific points that hon. Members have made.<br><br>
The background is straightforward. About 1 million new drivers a year come on to the roads as learners and, pace the odd Cambridge don—speaking as an Oxford man, I am not entirely surprised—most of them, and probably a higher proportion of Oxford dons than Cambridge dons, manage to pass the test and become qualified drivers. If the worthy gentleman to whom my hon. Friends the Members for Blackpool, South (Mr. Hawkins) and for Rutland and Melton referred ever becomes a Member of the House, I shall remember to avoid parking anywhere near him in the car park.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend goes any further down that road, he should be aware that my friend started life as an Oxford man and was president of the Oxford union. It was only on becoming a don that he so sadly went down market.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I knew the minute that I embarked on this discussion that it was P-plate territory. No more about dons.<br><br>
The important point is that 1 million new drivers a year come on to the roads. They start as learners and the vast
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
majority pass the test. It is true that fewer people are killed on the roads now than in any year since records began and that we have an excellent record, probably the best in the developed world on any fair assessment. That is not a tribute to politicians of any party, but to the huge amount of good technical work done by road safety officers and the superb team that I have known and admired over the past two or three years at the Department of Transport.<br><br>
A great many voluntary groups have also been involved and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents and the Institute of Advanced Motorists, of which I am proud to be a member, have contributed towards driver quality, as have the AA and Royal Automobile Club.<br><br>
However, the total of deaths still amounts to the killing of every occupant of a fully laden jumbo jet about once every six weeks. One has occasionally to put the facts in such a way, because it is the stark reality. If such a crash were to happen, it might concentrate people's attention more on the fact that there is a huge problem.<br><br>
The Bill is not the only measure that is being taken in relation to newly qualified drivers. I recently attended a meeting with representatives from schools to discuss how 16-plus awareness of driving might be improved. I was interested to know that there is a huge amount of material available in schools, for example on the subject of stranger danger.<br><br>
I shall not elaborate too much, because stranger danger has nothing to do with the Bill, but such material has to be carefully handled—most people who abuse children are known to the children. However, I had to point out to officials mat, although a road safety story might not be as newsworthy, in the average education authority the prospect of a child losing its life as a consequence of abuse, attack or murder by a deranged person is extraordinarily small. In contrast, the prospect of a number of young people being killed either as pedestrians or as newly qualified drivers can be measured in significant numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware that this is a specific Bill. He will also be aware of my concern about the effect of heavy goods vehicle drivers on safety and the number of deaths that result from HGV accidents. Can we confidently hope that he will address that problem before very long and bring something before the House?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Under clause 1, and this is incidentally a technical answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Batiey and Spen, a probationary period applies and starts from the date on which a driver first obtains a full licence to drive a specific category of vehicle. That means that the number of HGV drivers affected by the Bill would be extremely small because of their need to obtain the additional qualification after having obtained a full licence and before beginning work as HGV drivers. However, if any of them obtain HGV status within the two years from which they first obtained a licence, they would be caught by the provisions of the Bill. As to other matters relating to HGV safety, I acknowledge the keen interest of the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich. I am aware of her concern and I am studying with my officials further measures that we can bring forward in that regard.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0394">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
We can start from the proposition that there are essentially three elements in road accidents: first, the way vehicles are manufactured and can be handled, secondly the way the road is laid out and whether it is comprehensible and safe and thirdly, driver skill, attitude and education—the most important is that third element. It is said that about 95 per cent. of all injury accidents involve human error. It may be the error of a pedestrian who does not look, but it is still human error. We are therefore keen to correct that, particularly in relation to newly qualified drivers.<br><br>
A number of hon. Members have mentioned this morning that a package of measures has been introduced in that regard. One is "Pass Plus". There is a general agreement that "Pass Plus" has worked extremely well. My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham mentioned it on Second Reading. We have issued 1,000 certificates already and 26 insurance companies have signed up. The scheme is only eight weeks old and it is quite clear that it works because there is something in it for the driving instructors, for the insurance companies, but crucially for the new driver or, more likely, for the parents of the new driver who pay the premiums for the car insurance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Peacock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend obviously has young children like I do and knows the experience. The scheme has worked very well.<br><br>
The second element that I can deal with as it answers questions raised by the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North (Mr. O'Brien) and my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham is that of the theory test. We should be clear about what it can and cannot do. The second directive on driver testing requires the introduction by member states of an appropriate theory test into their driving test arrangements by a date that I cannot remember.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can help the Minister. It is 1 July 1996.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can say, without a smile, that I was about to say that it was either 1 June or 1 July 1996. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
In answer to the hon. Gentleman's question, if a driver had his licence revoked by the Secretary of State and had to take a new test, he would have to take the then current test. If that was before the introduction of a theory test, there would not be an additional component. If it was afterwards, a theory test element would be added, regardless of whether the original test taken by the applicant had included it.<br><br>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North for his suggestion that new drivers who are disqualified should, on retaking their tests, be required to undergo mandatory training. I will study that suggestion wth care.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman knows—I am sure that the Police Federation will have discussed it with him—presently there is no requirement to have qualified instruction before taking a driving test. The person simply arrives and takes their test and if they pass they obtain their licence. There is a strong lobby from the industry
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
stressing that it would be preferable for all applicants to undergo a period of qualified instruction. I suspect that the introduction of the theory test, in whatever form it emerges—we are still studying the optimum format for that—will induce more, regular, qualified instruction because it is generally recognised that it is likely to lead to a higher standard of awareness and appreciation of the "Highway Code" than has previously been the case.<br><br>
There is an interesting case for introducing mandatory training for drivers who need to be retested, but I have reservations. Under the Bill there would be a simple proposition that can be expressed by saying, "You did not learn the lesson that you were supposed to have learned when we passed you. We clearly made an error in passing you. Please go back and try again, and we will try to make sure that this time we all do the job properly."<br><br>
That has the virtue of being straightforward. One starts again with a provisional licence—assuming that one is in the simple position of having only one licence—and takes a test, theory test or no. If we were to introduce the element suggested by the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North, one would have to be able to identify the disqualified driver who is being retested, as distinct from the general group of probationary licence holders who would be making themselves available for testing. I am sure that the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North can understand the point that I am making, albeit rather haltingly. However, I have said that I will consider the suggestion and I will take it on board. I can see that there may be some virtue in it. Perhaps we can correspond on that during the proceedings on the Bill.<br><br>
The theory test will have an impact on how we can deal with the problem of the newly-qualified driver. The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller), who has always been concerned about these issues, made his point about penalties in his intervention during the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen. We shall not pursue that here but I understood his point. He knows that some of us have some sympathy with him, even if we think that the technical answer is that the penalties are available.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman said that most of us have an accident before we grow up as drivers. I put myself in that category. My hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen was terrified the moment that she was left alone in the car but I remember, at the age of 17, being absolutely delighted. It had something to do with growing up, particularly for young males at that age and it probably sends all the wrong signals to young drivers. I could not have been more delighted. My one problem was that I had the Ford Anglia by the hour only, with strict instructions to take it straight back to the driving school. I managed to return it by a circuitous route, but it took me a few years before I managed to acquire a car.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is very interesting, but we must return to the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that my driving experiences would fill a volume or two and I am not entirely sure whether you, Mr. Hill, would be happy if I regaled you with them.<br><br>
There is an important point, that has been made by several hon. Members. The Bill is about new, not young drivers. There is a problem of inexperienced drivers, which my hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0395">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
discussed, but slow, hesitant drivers, who make unpredictable moves, can be as dangerous as aggressive drivers. Let us not kid ourselves, the real problem is caused by irresponsible and aggressive drivers who think that they can drive on water—I hope that members of the Committee understand my metaphor. Such drivers are very good at video games. At 12 or 13 they can fly fighter aircraft faster than most qualified fighter pilots because they do it on simulators, which are freely available and cheap. They can be found in every motorway service area. They are extraordinarily competent at handling the machinery, but, in many cases, they lack a responsible attitude. They also lack hazard perception, which, although it is outside the scope of the Bill, is equally important.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen referred to the AA's recent LDQ addition—learner driver questionnaire—to the school's pack, which we are currently disseminating. The LDQ is an interesting, interactive programme, which tests young people's safety in terms of their aggressiveness on the road. That is a significant issue for drivers.<br><br>
The vast majority of young people will understand the need to tame that aggression. The AA programme is endeavouring to treat young drivers as more responsible adults and to try to get them to understand that, for example, when one is newly qualified, the skill with which to impress one's girlfriend is that one is an expert, defensive and safe driver and not merely someone who knows which pedal is the accelerator. If we can reach that stage, we shall have achieved a lot. The AA has a fine programme. That is the stick that must accompany all the available carrots.<br><br>
The probationary period included in the Bill recognises that, for a short period—two years is a modest amount of time—new drivers must be treated as being on probation, in the true sense of the word. The hon. Member for Warwickshire, North referred to that point as part of a culture change, with which I entirely agree. We are in the business of culture change and it is important that we achieve that.<br><br>
I know that the hon. Gentleman will agree that in the United States, where speed limits traditionally have been much slower, it is normal for motorists to drive for long periods, when there is no prospect of helicopters or camera technology, at speeds that would be regarded as a dawdle on British roads. That is not because they are less macho—they make interminable movies that focus on people who drive at horrendous speeds—but because their culture determines the pattern of their driving. The concept of good driving must be inculcated into people. As every Jesuit knows, it is best to do that at the earliest possible age.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham proposed the introduction of probationary plates in his thoughtful speech. We discussed probationary plates briefly on Second Reading. There is a great deal of public support for the idea. In Northern Ireland, there is a system of R-plates—"R" stands for "restricted"—that works in the way in which my hon. Friend suggested. Queen's university recently conducted a study of restricted plates. It covered a long period of implementation. Unfortunately, it did not produce especially helpful information, partly because of insufficient evidence of accident rates for new drivers before R-plates were
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
introduced. The evidence showed that R-plates were generally regarded as a good idea by people in Northern Ireland, and that they were fitted when required. But we have not been able to prove a link between R-plates and a reduction in accidents. Such a link must be the cornerstone of their introduction.<br><br>
The R-plate concept restricts a driver to 45 mph on any road for a specific period of time. That speed may be reasonable on a rural single carriageway where many young drivers come to grief, but on a motorway, it would only frustrate other drivers and cause more problems than it solved. Northern Ireland has one large piece of motorway on which it is rare to see cars with R-plates. New drivers either do not use that road, or they remove the R-plates and drive much faster than 45 mph.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Minister, can you point out where R-plates are mentioned in clause 1?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Their relevance is that they are used for a probationary period, which has widespread application, not only in Northern Ireland but in Australia, New Zealand, parts of me United States of America and Canada. Several continental countries use plates with distinctive markings to show that the driver is undergoing a probationary period. I am sure that you, Mr. Hill, would not want me to go through the experiences of all those countries.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Stick to the mainland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will indeed. The clause does not provide for evidence on the outside of a vehicle to show that a driver is in a probationary period. Many people, including my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham, believe that that is a defect in the clause. That is the context of my remarks.<br><br>
I have not closed my mind to using external identification of a probationary driver, but we want to examine the evidence that is available from other countries. The research in Northern Ireland—which is in the United Kingdom, albeit not on the mainland—is inconclusive. If there is a general sense that the public accept the concept and if it can be related to a reduction in accidents, by all means let us have it. However, I have one reservation. Precisely those bad eggs that we are trying to get at are least likely to bother to put the plate on and that has always been a concern. Mrs. Vicky Stone of the Learn and Live campaign has designed a green and white plate which hon. Members may have seen and which identifies a new driver. That excellent initiative is entirely voluntary at the moment and it would be important to set any official designation apart from it.<br><br>

The clause refers to two years, beginning with the day on which a person becomes a qualified driver. My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham asked whether that was the right period. We need not detain ourselves overlong on that. My hon. Friend will recall that there would be no purpose to the clause if we chose three years because a period would be caught by the normal requirement and be susceptible to disqualification if they had accumulated a certain number of points. I shall return to points later, but the period must be less than three years to be effective.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
The obvious alternative, therefore, is one year. I discussed that period with the Bill's promoter and we agreed that we are not in the business of applying a wholly draconian regime to young people. That would not be in the spirit of the proposals of my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and would not do any good. If we were seen to be hitting out at every young driver for the slightest mistake, the psychological framework for action that we seek to establish would be wholly vitiated. The important thing about the two-year period is that it is less than the period permitted for the normal accumulation of points, but is not an unreasonable period during which young people can be under some supervision.<br><br>
As to whether the number of points is correct, if we had moved to a figure other than six, then nine points in two years would be slightly worse than 12 in three. What we are looking for is people who have gone beyond the norm. The number of points is, strictly speaking, the concern of clause 2, but if we consider the number within a certain time frame the two relate to each other.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North knows, the police and emergency services drive under the same regime as every other driver. Exemptions are available for the police and other services when they are dealing with an emergency or a situation that calls for them to act outside normal road traffic law, but the general rule is that they are covered by the usual principles. Off duty or on, they are expected to observe the highway code and road traffic regulations. Technically, that means that they are as vulnerable to the Bill as anyone else. In practice, the Police Federation will acknowledge that few people under 19 or who have acquired their driving licences only within the previous two years will be allowed to drive police vehicles on the road. The police recognise that whatever else a driver needs, he needs experience before being allowed out with a police vehicle.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Warwickshire, North raised the thorny issue of age. It is not strictly within the scope of the clause, but if the question is raised of beginning the probationary period from the moment at which a person first acquires a licence, it is legitimate to argue that safety would be best enhanced by not issuing that person with a licence so soon. There is some merit in that argument, as I am sure me hon. Gentleman acknowledges. We debated it at length and discussed it with several safety organisations, including me Association of Chief Police Officers. The hon. Gentleman must forgive me, as I cannot remember whether the matter was discussed with the Police Federation—as he knows, such questions are usually addressed to the traffic committee of the Association of Chief Police Officers for its deliberation.<br><br>
We reached the conclusion that, particularly in relation to the minimum driving age elsewhere, 17 remained about the right age at which to introduce people to driving. The persuasive argument is that keeping people off the road at that time of life might bring about a marginal decrease in accidents in that category, but many of the consultees shared a real suspicion that it would lead to much more unlawful driving, which is in no one's interest. It is far better for young people to train for and pass a driving test—even within a few weeks of their 17th birthday, so that they get behind the wheel just as they are moving into the upper sixth, towards the end of their time at school. On balance, arguments have favoured retaining the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
present age qualification and we have no plans to alter it. I have already dealt with the other points that the hon. Gentleman made.<br><br>
In answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen I should mention that it is recognised that the driver test cannot deal with all manner of driving conditions. It is horrifying to realise that a young person who acquires a licence at 17 years and a few weeks is lawfully allowed to drive a Ferrari Testarossa on a motorway. That rarely happens, thank goodness, but we should be concerned about it. That is not the least of the reasons for the attractiveness of the restricted or P-plate, but it also is an example of the unfeasibility of expecting a driving test to cover all types of motor vehicle or conditions.<br><br>
For example, it is recognised that on balance it is safer not to allow learner drivers on to motorways, even though they will need experience of motorway driving, because of the risk that their presence on motorways would present to other motorway drivers. The balance is a difficult one, but we have had to achieve one. More importantly, since responsible young people are, thank goodness, still the majority, motorway driving is not the only factor. Frequently, people do not drive in bad weather until they are fully qualified. My hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen spoke of taking a test in a snow cloud, but most people take it in dry, bright conditions and often schedule their lessons and tests accordingly. They face a new predicament in snow and we hope to tackle that in all the training that we want to attach to the driving test and the theory test.<br><br>
As to exchange and eligibility, I am not too greatly disturbed by me Liechtenstein driving contingent mentioned in subsection (3) because I am advised by my excellent officials that me number of Liechtenstinians likely to be caught by the Bill is small. Indeed, I have no evidence that there will be any. In any case, as my official speaking note so aptly puts it, we have quite enough idiots of our own to keep the courts busy. One reason for being so grateful to officials is that just occasionally a shaft of real light, of me type that enlivens all our lives, dawns.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen mentioned Irish licences. Clearly it is important that under the directive's provisions a licence obtained by a motorist in France, Spain or Portugal will be a valid driving licence in Great Britain when the second driving licence directive comes into force. At present, non-British licences must be exchanged for British licences after one year's residence in Great Britain; this will apply to drivers from outside the European Community in future, and it applies to EC drivers now. When the second driving licence directive comes into force, there will be no requirement to exchange EC licences for British licences, so they will remain valid until they would normally expire, which, for British licences, is at age 70. The concept of mutual recognition will also apply to licences from EEA countries from the same date, subject to me provisions of clause 1(3).<br><br>
The Bill does not give the Secretary of State power to revoke a non-British licence. As my hon. Friends will appreciate, that would be extremely difficult to enforce. To answer my hon. Friend me Member for Blackpool, South, there are very few such drivers on British roads.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to hear that there are not many people who could incur double penalty points and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0397">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
still continue to drive. However, if there is to be increased recognition of foreign drivers licences in the United Kingdom, should not the Minister do something about that? A bizarre situation could arise where two persons were involved in an accident, and were equally culpable, and the United Kingdom driver could have his licence revoked while the other person in precisely the same position would be allowed to continue driving, using a foreign licence. That would be most unsatisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That will be covered by clause 3, when we get to it. I take careful note of all these points that relate to later clauses in the Bill, but we must make some progress on clause 1.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Hill. By all means let us discuss this issue under clause 3.<br><br>
In terms of the extent to which clause 1 establishes the concept of an EEA state and the EEA agreement, the point being made by the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich and by my hon. Friends is none the less quite important, for the following reason. If we intend to apply the provisions of probation and subsequent disqualification to foreign drivers from the date at which a recognised licence, which may not simply be a United Kingdom licence, was obtained, it is quite relevant to question whether the Secretary of State is sure that he has the power to do that. But I must tell the hon. Lady that he does not.<br><br>
Under mutual recognition arrangements, people will not be acquiring 15 different driving licences, one for each Community country. If we are to be sensible, we do not need to detain ourselves by considering the idea that someone will acquire 15 different driving licences before he starts his career of death and destruction on the roads and that he will swap them around as each licence picks up six penalty points. The vast majority of drivers will have one licence. However, we must recognise that, at some future date, we may need to amend the Bill if the problem described is deemed to be sufficiently widespread.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Merchant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to clear up a point on the definition of the probationary period applying to non-United Kingdom licences. It is an important principle. Once the new directive is in force, and bearing in mind the implications of the clause, will it be possible for a British citizen to pass a test in another member state, obtain the licence of that country and then return to Britain to drive indefinitely on British roads without the provisions of the Bill being brought to bear upon him?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Technically speaking, the answer is yes. The Secretary of State does not have power to interfere with licences issued by other member states. He must accept the principle of mutual recognition, which underpins the second European Community driver directive, and that is a sensible arrangement. I am healthily sceptical about a great deal that emanates from Brussels; that might attract the affection of my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan), not to mention the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich—if we get her going. I must add that she is a marvellous person. However, on this issue, I admire the arrangements in place.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
A licence could be obtained in the way described. A British Secretary of State would not be able to interfere with that. If the person became resident here and chose to exchange the licence, it would be amended in the appropriate way.<br><br>
I hope that my remarks have been useful to the Committee. As you will have observed, Mr. Hill, every member of the Committee on both sides has wanted to speak to this important clause. I hope that my explanation has helped to expedite it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is unusual. With private Members' Bills, the person who is supposed to sum up is usually the promoter of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Michael Clark</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will do my best to stick to discussion of the probationary period, as I too am on probation at present.<br><br>
I thank the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston for his support on Second Reading and in Committee. He said that the Bill had some critics, but he pointed out that the critics were those who consider themselves to be perfect drivers and who do not see the need for such legislation.<br><br>
I have received three anonymous letters. One was from Essex and two were from other parts of the country. They were from parents who wanted to remain anonymous because they were writing about their own children. They said how important the Bill was in order to put those children on probation. The parents have tried to instil a sense of responsibility for safe driving, but the children, having passed their tests, are not driving safely. They believe that the Bill will do what they, as parents, have been unable to do. I can understand why the letters were anonymous.<br><br>
The Bill has the support of the Metropolitan police, the AA and the RAC. The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston said that the term "road accident" was a terrible euphemism. Those who have lost members of our families in road accidents know what a terrible euphemism the term is. Under the title of "road accident" there is a great deal of heartache, anxiety and a sense of bereavement that is never expunged.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham asked why the probationary period was two years. The alternatives were three years or one year. Three years would be too harsh, because it would put people on probation up to the time at which they would fall into the three-year disqualification period that all of us have as fully qualified and experienced drivers. There is no need for a double barrier at three years; there is a barrier at three years already, so that period is ruled out on that ground and on the ground of the harshness of a three-year probation.<br><br>
One year would be too lenient; in any case, the first year after passing a test is the year in which drivers are being a little careful. By the third year drivers are experienced, but in the second year drivers have perhaps abandoned their care and have not yet gained experience. The second year is thus perhaps the reckless period, so two years seems to be the right amount of time.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham pointed out that the AA handout dated 31 March referred on its first page to the Road Traffic (New Drivers) Bill, but on the second page referred, in a Freudian slip, to the Road Traffic (Young Drivers) Bill. That says it all; perhaps it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0398">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
was a deliberate mistake on the part of the AA—one never knows. However, it has been picked up on and mentioned in Committee.<br><br>
The other points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham—P-plates, R-plates, foreign licence driving, which will be dealt with under clause 3, and the theory test—were dealt with by my hon. Friend the Minister.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich—I am grateful for her support—made the important point that road safety is not an add-on, but an important part of everyday life. All of us, if not driving on a given day, will be pedestrians and in contact with motor vehicles.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton talked about young drivers. As he pointed out, 10 per cent. of drivers are young drivers, but 20 per cent, of accidents and 25 per cent, of fatalities involve young drivers—and very often the fatalities are not the young drivers, but others.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Warwickshire, North—he is unfortunately not in Committee at the moment but I hope that he will read my comments—brings specialist knowledge to the Committee and I am grateful to him for agreeing to serve on it. As he declared, he is an adviser to the Police Federation with a great deal of experience of road safety before coming to the House.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Warwickshire, North said that the Bill would probably have long-term tamer than short-term benefits and compared it to the drink/drive legislation. His other points about the impact on emergency service drivers, the possibility of raising the driving age to 18, theory tests and mandatory training were dealt with by the Minister.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South referred to the article in today's press about Germans coming to Wigan and other nationalities coming to this country to pass our driving test, which they reckon is cheaper and easier than their own. But if they pass our test, obtain a British licence and drive in this country on it, they will be subject to the Bill. That closes the loophole referred to earlier by other hon. Members.<br><br>
My hon. Friends the Members for Blackpool, South and for Rutland and Melton referred to their friend Mr. O'Shaughnessy, who failed his driving test 12 times but has passed it at last, and pointed out that he is a parliamentary candidate. My experience is that when we stand for Parliament we fail the first time, rather like taking our driving tests, and hope to pass the second time. I hope—[<i>Interruption.</i>] Well, some of us are lucky, but I hope that Mr. O'Shaughnessy is luckier in his attempts to get into Parliament than he was in his attempts to pass his driving test and does not suffer from a ratio of 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My experience was of passing the test first time but unfortunately being caught by the probationary period and not having my licence renewed after the first four years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Clark</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But men, if I remember, my hon. Friend passed his test to come into the House first time, so he cannot have everything.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen is well known for her interest in road safety and also for the fact that she is chairman of me parliamentary motor club.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
It is in that capacity that we welcome her to the Committee. She reminded us of the dangers of motorcycles and the importance of a probationary period for motorcycle drivers.<br><br>
Finally, I turn to the remarks made by the Minister. I thank him for his kind opening remarks. He stressed the importance of road safety and the number of deaths that the absence of road safety brings about, comparing it to 747s. As you observed, Mr. Hill, the Minister not only presented the case but summed it up, so there is no need for me to sum up too much of what he said. However, I thought it appropriate when he ended by saying that the probationary period will trap young, male drivers wanting to drive Ferrari Testosterones, or words to that effect.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This extensive group of amendments covers clauses 2, 3, 5 and 9 and schedule 1. Some of the amendments are important and some are not but they are linked and it will probably make more sense if I explain them in broad terms as a group, rather than dealing with them separately or in smaller batches.<br><br>
The meaty amendments are Nos. 3 and 5 to clauses 2 and 3 and deal with an important principle. I shall set out the background, which I hope will be helpful. Clause 2 is in two parts, dealing first with the courts in subsections (1) and (2) and then with fixed penalty clerks in subsections (3), (4) and (5).<br><br>
We shall put aside for the moment the issue of fixed penalty clerks, for whom there is a separate arrangement. They are relevant these days because under the arrangements operated by police forces for the conviction of young offenders—I hope that the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North might have something to say on this point—the police, quite sensibly, do not move instantly to convict young people on precisely the same basis as they would necessarily convict an adult driver. That adds an extra element which we should explore. However, if they do, they are likely to do it in relation to the fixed penalty notices which are increasingly a part of driving life these days.<br><br>
Subsection (1) requires the court to examine a licence. It may discover that the driver who has committed the offence is a qualified driver but that the date when the licence was issued puts him into the probationary period. It may also find that the number of points on the licence plus the number that would be added on the conviction that is currendy before the court takes that number to six or more. We are working on the principle, Mr. Hill, that you may accumulate these things normally by threes. I am sure you do not have any points on your licence at all, Mr. Hill. If you did, it would not be my place to invite you to disclose that fact to the Committee. You are far too adept at these matters to do so.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not mink that you would give me time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope not, Mr. Hill. We must make progress, as we both appreciate. Anyway, points tend to be acquired in threes. If the effect of the offence for which the driver has been convicted is to add points to those already held and the licence is still in its probationary period, subsection 2(2) requires the court to take the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
licence from the driver and to send it to the Secretary of State for revocation. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"the court must send the licence and its counterpart to the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
The use of the word "must", not "may", is a distinction that members of the Committee will have appreciated. That leads us to clause 3(1), under which the Secretary of State on receiving the licence from the court revokes it by serving notice on the holder. That all seems perfectly sensible and logical and we do not intend to disturb it.<br><br>
There is however a problem with the system that is outlined. In order for it to work, the courts need to get hold of the licence in the first place. Existing legislation provides the police with ample powers to get hold of the licence. Section 7 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 requires a person prosecuted for an endorsable offence either to deliver or post the licence to the court clerk so as to make it available the day before the hearing, or to have it with him or her at the relevant hearing.<br><br>
Section 27 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act requires the licence to be produced to the court if it does not already have it for endorsement at the time of conviction. Failure to produce the licence without good reason is a criminal offence which carries a level 3 penalty, of anything up to £1,000 at current rates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Peacock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we will be tough on this point. My recollection of sitting in courts was that people did not send their licences in. They did not appear for the case when it came up. It often had to be adjourned once, and sometimes twice. Eventually we would discover that the individual was going on holiday and needed to keep his licence. Therefore any leeway in the system encourages people to postpone their appearance at court for as long as they can for their own convenience.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is at the heart of the matter. Our debate is about whether the Bill should be amended to bring about quite radical changes to the whole of traffic law. My hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen is right. I do not know whether Opposition Members have experience as magistrates but I am told that licences are often not available, extremely conveniently. There could, of course, be genuine reasons but it may also be for the kind of reasons outlined by my hon. Friend.<br><br>
Perhaps I can make clear some of the reasons behind the amendments. My hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen has a great friend in the Bill's promoter, who has made it clear that he is concerned that people might try to avoid penalties by simply not bothering to turn up with the right piece of paper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Merchant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This may be the moment to raise a query on amendments Nos. 3 and 5. They refer to the licence "and its counterpart". I am puzzled by that. As far as I know, my licence does not have a counterpart—certainly, I have never been able to find it. What does that refer to, and what is its impact?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a perfectly fair point. Clause 2(l)(d) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"the court has received the licence and its counterpart or they have been produced to the court".</p></blockquote>
The counterpart is a creature of statute. My briefing note from my officials tells me that it is a somewhat mythical one, and one may make of that what one will. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0400">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
counterpart made its first appearance in an obscure statutory instrument, the Driving Licences (Community Driving Licence) Regulations 1990. The explanatory note described them as part of the process of giving effect to the first EC directive on driver licences, which dates from 1980. We have been talking of the second directive, which is more relevant to matters such as mutual recognition and theory tests. The first directive prescribed a standard, Europe-wide licence design.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich might say something that I would find it difficult to agree with but which would have given a frisson of pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Merchant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was a cry of pain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Be that as it may, the directive prescribed a standard, Europe-wide licence design which did not cater for all that is normally shown on a British licence. In particular, the EC-wide licence does not provide for penalty points or endorsements and does not show provisional licence entitlements. Both of these are crucial to the Bill; and since 1990 the current type of British licence has been two documents in one. It includes a licence that conforms to the European design and the counterpart, which contains information required by UK law but which is not part of the first directive's requirements.<br><br>
The counterpart contains the convictions, penalty points, disqualifications and statements about provisional entitlements. Just to confuse the matter, the counterpart and the licence are actually the same piece of paper. As so often, to comply with the regulations we have had to apply some modest invention. As my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham said, most licence holders probably do not know that they have a counterpart. If a policeman asked them to produce it, they would not know what it was. But the Bill does not contain the counterpart's first appearance in primary legislation. The Road Traffic Act 1991, which amended the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988, refers to "the counterpart".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The wording and shape of the British licence conforms to the overall requirements of the original directive, but it is necessary in British law to provide space on the licence to record penalty points. Is the Minister suggesting that that will change in future?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am indeed. I wish to be clear about the implications of the first and second directive. As the hon. Lady knows, we plan, if possible, to introduce a plastic card licence in the middle of 1996, in accord with our Community partners. The card will contain information on its surface. It will include a photograph of the driver, the EU circle of stars, and a square on a blue background, which will display the letters of the individual member state.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister is straying too wide. There are many amendments, and the Minister's skill means that he can work almost any point into the discussion, but we have drifted too wide.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. I would not dream of criticising the Chair. However, my point
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
about the framing of the licence is important. The form of the licence is the subject of our discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Bill refers to a counterpart. If I may be allowed to express a personal opinion, it is relevant to point out that the counterpart is currently on the same piece of paper as the licence. The hon. Lady asked me a pertinent question. She asked about the future, when there will be a plastic card—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where will the counterpart be?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I could not have put it better myself. Your question, Mr. Hill, sums up the relevance to the debate of the hon. Lady's question. I tried to reply in that spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Please continue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hill.<br><br>
People have few objections to photographs. It may surprise the hon. Lady, who shares many of my views on European matters, that I do not object to using the letters of the member state to determine the nationality of the licence. If my licence has an identical format to that in any other Community country, except for the letters that denote it as a UK licence, not a Portuguese or a Greek licence, that conveys to me a real right to drive in another Community country without let or hindrance save that which is proscribed by normal road traffic law in that country. There is an argument for national flags. I understand the sentiment behind that. But I have always supported a common form of identification, with the appropriate design and number of stars, but also with the letters that identify the Community country.<br><br>
However, in the middle of 1996, when the new licence is issued, there will no longer be a single piece of paper. The hon. Lady has identified the fact that one will need two documents. One will be a person's driving licence and the other will be the progression of the present counterpart. That is not as burdensome as it sounds because the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency already has an extensive record, which is accessed by the courts to record convictions, disqualifications, points and so on. Thus, the possession or non-possession of the piece of paper would not, for example, allow somebody to evade the law, as the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich was suggesting. But she was right in saying that people will be required to produce two pieces of paper. The Bill will not alter the requirement by which a person does not have to produce his licence at the point at which he may be requested to do so. Those arrangements will continue.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
I spoke about the way in which the amendments refer to subsection (2) and clause 3. I cannot blame my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford for reaching the conclusion that, as the courts are expected to receive licences in the normal course of their work, they would have no difficulty in sending them to the Secretary of State for revocation. If you recall, Mr. Hill, we were studying the case of somebody not turning up with the licence. But, as Oscar Wilde remarked, the truth is rarely pure and never simple. Again, I am grateful to the literate members of my staff for that illusion, which is nothing less than I would have expected from them.<br><br>

My hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key) was a most distinguished holder of the office that I now have the honour to hold. He knows the officials in person and will appreciate the quality of their advice to Ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Key <span class='memberconstituency'>(Salisbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I endorse that point. It is relevant to the amendment and yet I never fail to be amazed at the depth of knowledge and breadth of wisdom of the officials in the Department of Transport. I was always grateful to them, as I am sure is my hon. Friend. The quality of language that I have so far heard in the Committee confirms that point.<br><br>
My intervention gives me the opportunity to apologise for my absence for certain periods this morning: I have been considering our southern flank for most of the morning on the Defence Select Committee. I hesitate to mislead the Committee into thinking that we should talk about any other southern flank.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mackinlay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Tory marginals in the south-east!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One cannot intervene on an intervention.<br><br>
It has been an enormous pleasure to hear the language and I look forward to many more happy hours listening to my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Officials put in a huge amount of time on Bills and it was nice of my hon. Friend to praise them so elegantly.<br><br>
We are making the serious point about the sad reality that, in certain cases, the courts do not obtain the licences of drivers whom they are sentencing. Indeed, one could say that the agency has become the victim of its own success because the computerised record is far more accurate than the pieces of paper that it issues. The police and the courts rely increasingly on the computerised record and do not trouble themselves much about obtaining the pieces of paper, even though they have the power to insist on seeing them.<br><br>
The point has been put to me that the procedure could work by means of the computer record and the procedure whereby the court keeps it up to date. That procedure works smoothly and is well established. In the end, that argument is not totally persuasive. I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford was right to build on existing legislation, which requires the production of licences as the basic procedure that we are adopting.<br><br>
We are debating a private Member's Bill and it is a modest Bill, yet it has ten clauses and a schedule already and has about 50 amendments tabled. You, Mr. Hill, have a huge amount of experience of Bills. I believe that such a Bill should not be used to reinvent the entire system of dealing with the production of licences. We have said that it is not right to do that in this Bill and that we are trying to adapt what we have to the provisions in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make two points. First, I understand why we do not want to turn this into a Christmas tree Bill. Therefore, I was persuaded not to table amendments on behalf of Motorcycle Action. It made sensible suggestions about how legislation on such matters should be improved. However, it was unlikely that those suggestions would have been within the terms of the Bill.<br><br>
Secondly, will my hon. Friend the Minister advise me on what happens if the motor cyclist that we mentioned or
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
a probationary licence holder of any vehicle were driving a military vehicle? It is an important issue. An increased number of military vehicles are on the roads because of their withdrawal from Germany. Military vehicles will operate under separate regulations, with different rules and a different licensing procedure—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We do not want to discuss the southern flank in Europe or military vehicles. We are making slow progress and I know that the Minister is anxious to get the Bill through Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the thrust of my hon. Friend's point. Essentially, normal rules apply to military licences. As with police and other emergency service drivers, military licence holders will not be exempt from the general provisions of the Bill. The Bill deals with new drivers. The probationary period begins at the point at which qualifications are initially obtained in the first category.<br><br>
The Bill is not the means by which we shall reinvent a new system for dealing with licence production. As long as underlying legislation remains, drivers will be requested to send or deliver their licences and counterparts to the courts. The more honest ones will always do so. If, having examined the licence and discovered that the conditions in clause 2(1) of the Bill applied and that sufficient points had been added to put a driver above the limit, it would send the wrong signals for a court official to hand the licence back and say, "Here you are. Don't use it because in the next couple of days the Secretary of State will revoke it.". That is not realistic. Given the pressure of work on the courts, there would seldom be time for such remarks to be made. A driver would simply get his licence back. The obvious invitation for many people would be to continue to use it. They would ignore any subsequent communication from Swansea.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Peacock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: From court experience, if a driver lost a licence and it were handed to the court, it would not be returned to him on that day. That would be inconvenient for someone who had driven to court knowing that he would lose his licence, but he would argue that he needed the licence to drive home. The court would say, "Tough. Your licence is with us. You have to make other arrangements to get your car home.".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That gets to the heart of the problem. Some of those cases may involve people who must go away the day before the hearing or who are ill, but the majority are likely to want to avoid producing their licence. Although there is nothing fundamentally wrong with clause 2, we must supplement its provisions to ensure that those cases are covered.<br><br>
This group of amendments would ensure that the procedure is not aborted because the right documents failed to materialise. That is the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen. The court can act on the basis of the licence record and the Secretary of State can act on the basis of a notification from the court. That is not necessarily the preferred modus operandi, but it may be used when attempts to obtain a licence fail. If that notice procedure is not allowed, the alternative is to adjourn the hearing for a long time—which might be just what the driver wanted while attempts are made, at least
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0402">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
in theory, to recover the licence. The driver would be able perfectly legally to continue driving during the adjournment. It is not in the interests of road safety, let alone the proper expedition of the courts, to let matters hang in the air in that way. It is better to allow the court to deal with the offence as soon as it can and to send the information to Swansea, from where a letter can be sent on behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, revoking the licence.<br><br>
If the court does not receive a licence from the accused, there is an arrangement for it to request a copy from Swansea, so it will have probably the most accurate record of the licence held by the accused person. If it is discovered that the relevant conditions are met, the court will endorse the licence accordingly and the notice will be sufficient to require the Secretary of State to exercise his authority to revoke. Either the notice of the court's decision, together with the licence, would cause the Secretary of State to use his powers, or the simple issue of the notice would cause the powers to be invoked. In many ways, that is a fairly sweet answer to our difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to form a clearer idea of the time scale, since the hon. Member for Batley and Spen rightly expressed concern about delays. A considerable time could elapse before the revocation of the licence, because, if the accused person did not produce the licence at the first hearing, the court would presumably have to apply to Swansea to produce the copy, upon which an order could be made and a copy sent to the Secretary of State. He could then make a revocation order and serve a notice, specifying a revocation date subsequent to the date of service. What time scale is envisaged?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that everything would be done on the same day. The notice would be sent by the court by whatever electronic means were available, if not by letter post, and the revocation would take effect once the Secretary of State had the notice. Only the transmission time is at issue. The Secretary of State would not have the power to determine whether, having received the notice, to exercise his powers. That is to avoid a great time delay between a court's decision and a revocation. The confusion is rather like asking whether a licence is endorsed at the moment when a person is convicted, or a minute later. The answer is that, whereas it may take hours or days to have the relevant words typed on the licence, the endorsements apply from the moment when the conviction is received. My understanding is that the clause deals with a similar legal process. The relevant provision is clause 3(1), which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where the Secretary of State receives a person's licence and its counterpart sent to him in accordance with section 2 he must by notice served on that person revoke the licence."</p></blockquote>
The revocation takes effect from the receipt of the notice by the Secretary of State, which means, I am advised, on the same day. It is an important point and, to make it quite clear, I shall write to the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North and to other members of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was more clause 3(2) and the amendment that will no doubt be made to it that were causing me concern. Amendment No. 6 would provide that the effective date of the notice of revocation
<br><blockquote><p>"may not be earlier than the date of service of that notice.".</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
It seemed to me that, in effect, there might be a delay, but I accept what the Minister has said. No doubt he will clarify it in writing in due course.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The relevance of subsection (3) is that it would be quite wrong and legal nonsense to antedate a notice of revocation. The hon. Gentleman will have read subsection (4), which refers to the notice being in writing. I will check whether that means that the revocation applies from the point at which conviction is obtained or whether a day, or perhaps two days, are required for the notice to be issued.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
For the sake of completeness, I should add that there is no need for parallel arrangements for fixed penalty clerks because under existing legislation, which the Bill will not affect, a fixed penalty clerk can accept payment of a fixed penalty only if it is accompanied by the licence and the counterpart. If the documents are not produced, he cannot do other than return the payment to the police and invite them to initiate a prosecution. In each case, FPCs will be able to comply with clause 2 as written.<br><br>
Amendment No. 3 affects clause 2(2). Instead of requiring the courts to send the licence and counterpart to the Secretary of State, it will require them in all cases to send him a notice of the particulars endorsed on the licence counterpart and, where they have the licence and counterpart, to send those as well. Amendment No. 5 requires the Secretary of State to revoke the licence if he either receives it, or receives the relevant notice. Amendment No. 1, which removes the necessity for the court to receive the licence, is supplementary and amendment No. 2 is consequential.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 4, 6, 7 and 14 are in a lower key, being essentially merely drafting improvements, tabled with the intention of avoiding excessive repetition. All references to sending documents or notices to the Secretary of State or to the sending of notices by the Secretary of State should be covered by a single set of provisions that the amendments would put into clause 9, the interpretation clause, instead of their being scattered round the Bill. There is need for greater clarity now that notices are sent on a two-way basis, from courts to the Secretary of State and from the Secretary of State to licence holders. Amendment No. 6 is consequential on amendment No. 5.<br><br>
Some provisions added to clause 9 apply to all notices, others to revocation notices only. As with other provisions in that clause, the basic principle is that expressions in the Bill be interpreted in the same way as in the two main road traffic acts—the Road Traffic Act 1990 and the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988. The provisions in section 107 of the 1990 Act that are being applied to notices of revocation are that a notice may be delivered or left at a person's last known, or be sent by post. These are standard uncontroversial matters. The expression
<br><blockquote><p>"at such address as the Secretary of State may determine"</p></blockquote>
appears in clause 2, but, if the amendments are accepted, it will appear in clause 9 instead. It is hallowed by usage in the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988. The address to which licences, counterparts and test certificates must be sent is the DVLA in Swansea, but the agency may not be located there for ever and a day and a simple
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0403">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
administrative means for changing the address is desirable.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 in schedule 1 are simply parallels to amendment No. 1. My hon. Friend will explain that schedule's intricacies, and the major surgery that he proposes on it, later in our deliberations. Amendment No. 19 removes a regulation-making power from the schedule which would be unnecessary if the other amendments in the group were carried.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 are different. They concern drivers who have successfully appealed against the decision of the court that led to their acquiring six penalty points. My hon. Friend will no doubt speak in more detail later about how clause 5 works, but suffice it to say that currently a licence may need to be granted while the appeal is pending to replace a licence that has been revoked—that is done under clause 5(1). If the appeal is successful, another licence must be granted under clause 5(2).<br><br>
We considered whether the first of the licences should be retained, but it would have penalty points shown on it that were no longer relevant, which would imply that it should be revoked under clause 3. If a holder has been able successfully to appeal against a conviction or a sentence, he would not have the slightest interest in having a licence with penalty points on it. Many people regard it as not in their interest should they be stopped by a policeman for him to see points on the licence, even if me points are expired or irrelevant.<br><br>
It is reasonable that we should have reached that decision, but it is also reasonable that the Secretary of State should not be obliged to issue a new licence until the old one has been returned; otherwise, people might cling on to two licences, which is not in the public interest. That is what amendments Nos. 9 and 10 are about. I hope that my remarks are helpful and I commend the amendments to the Committee.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mackinlay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee for not being here at the start of the debate. I spoke to the hon. Member for Rochford to explain that I would be delayed. I was grateful for his invitation to be associated with the Bill as a sponsor. I also told the Minister that I would be delayed.<br><br>
The only point on which I wonder whether the promoter or the Minister could help us is something that relates not only to the clause—it trespasses on other clauses and may need to be tidied up in another place if we do not have time in Committee to deal with it. There should be provision in the Bill to cover the separate jurisdictions that are outside the European Union—Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man.<br><br>
I single out the Isle of Man because it does its own licensing. I know from colleagues in the Tynwald that they are keen to have reciprocity in such matters. For example, when their courts issue a driving ban it is not held up in the United Kingdom, which is anomalous and foolish. There should be provision in the Bill added now or later as a new clause should the Parliaments in the Channel islands and the Isle of Man decide to adopt comparable legislation—they often do—and to ensure that their points apply to the United Kingdom. Those who obtain licences within those jurisdictions should not be exempt from the sanctions provided for in the Bill.</span></p>
