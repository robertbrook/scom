	<div class='clause'>Clause 2</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>SURRENDER OF LICENCES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed</i> [	<i>5 April</i>]: No. 1, in page 2, line 1, to leave out paragraph (d).—[	<i>Mr. Norris.</i>]</p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are discussing the following amendments: 2 to 7, 9, 10, 14, 16, 17 and 19.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Michael Clark 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rochford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank you, Mr. Hill, for taking the Chair so soon after our return from the Easter recess. I also thank my hon. Friends and colleagues who have come here this morning to try to ensure that the Bill completes the Committee stage and proceeds to Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will recall, Mr. Hill, that on the Wednesday before the Easter recess my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Norris), the Minister for Transport in London, summarised and explained the amendments to clause 2. During that debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen (Mrs. Peacock) asked about non-British driving licences and tests and I want to give a fuller answer to her questions and those from other hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rules on exchangeability and validity of licences from other European Union countries will change radically on 1 July next year when the second European directive on driving licences comes into force. On the same date, the provisions of that directive will be extended to non-European Union countries in the European Economic Area. The Bill has been drafted to reflect the new rules because it is impracticable for the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency to introduce the provisions of the Bill in advance of the major changes required to implement the second European directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill applies only to holders of British driving licences. The word "licence" is construed in the same way as in section 108 in part III of the Road Traffic Act 1988, which defines a licence, except where the context otherwise requires, as
	<br><blockquote><p>"a licence to drive a motor vehicle granted under this Part of this Act."</p></blockquote>
The Department of Transport considered the possibilities of applying the provisions to holders of licences of other European Economic Area countries, but was advised that it would not be possible to revoke a licence granted by an authority other than another European Economic Area state, and nor would those states be obliged to recognise such revocation were it to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, a licence granted under Part III of the 1988 Act is not necessarily granted only to people who have passed driving tests in Great Britain. It may be granted in exchange for an equivalent licence issued in Northern Ireland, the Channel Isles, the Isle of Man, Gibraltar or in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
other European Economic Area states, or on evidence of passing a test in Northern Ireland or any of those states or territories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all the cases mentioned, a British licence granted in exchange on or after 1 July next year will show the date of the holder's first becoming entitled to a full licence—that is, the date on which the probationary period begins in accordance with clause 1(1) of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the second European directive to which I referred earlier, a licence may be issued only by the authority of the applicant's country of normal residence which, with some exceptions, means the place where he lives for at least 185 days in each calendar year. Hence, a British licence cannot lawfully be granted to a non-resident in terms of the directive for use as a flag of convenience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to say that the hon. Gentleman's comments are not relevant to the amendments that we are discussing and I should be grateful if he would return to the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for that advice, Mr. Hill, which I entirely accept. I was attempting to explain more fully the effects of the amendments in respect of holders of non-British licences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That can be done on clause 2 stand part, which is only a moment in time away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that advice, Mr. Hill. I therefore move that clause 2 stands part of the Bill. I beg your pardon, Mr. Hill—I move the amendments as explained by my hon. Friend the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is the trouble with long recesses. The amendments were moved by the Minister before the Easter holiday; we are now discussing them and I thought that the hon. Member for Rochford (Dr. Clark) was summing up. Unless any other hon. Member wishes to speak on this subject, I shall put the Question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gwyneth Dunwoody 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Crewe and Nantwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume that we are on clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. We are on the amendments, and I shall now put the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am now not confused, but possessed of the belief that, if we are not careful, when this debate is written up it will appear confusing. I started down a line of summary of the clause at the wrong stage of our proceedings—which you quite rightly pointed out, Mr. Hill—and I am now picking up the thread at the correct stage which is the clause stand part debate. Thank you for allowing me to say that, Mr. Hill, as it will explain the rather strange gap in my explanation of non-British driving licences. Thank you for your guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall resume my explanation by saying that the second European directive does not require holders of the EEA licences to surrender them when they change their country of normal residence. On the contrary, they are entitled to keep the licences as long as they remain valid and all EEA states must recognise their validity. However, given the residence requirements for obtaining a licence in the first place, it is unlikely that there will be many drivers who have changed their place of residence during their probationary period. No doubt, some visitors and people studying or working temporarily in Britain who hold non-British licences would be subject to the provisions of the Bill if their licences were British. It is simply not practical for the Bill to cover those groups of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the second European directive's provisions do not apply to the eligibility within Great Britain of licences from Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and Gibraltar, the rules applying to them are, in practical terms, very similar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British licences may be granted in exchange for licences issued by certain designated countries outside the EEA. In those cases, because the licences come in various forms, it is often not possible to ascertain the date that would mark the start of the probationary period under clause 1. Licences granted in exchange from a third country are identified by a special code. Where such a licence cannot show the date of first entitlement, the space will display the date exchange preceded by a symbol indicating that the licence was issued earlier than that date. People who acquire a British licence by that form of exchange—the most numerous being Australians and New Zealanders—will not be subject to the probationary period because they are not covered by clause 1(2).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman moves on, may I ask how international drivers' licences will be affected by the change? I discovered the other weekend something that I should have known as a user of an international driver's licence. It is extraordinary that although Welsh driving licences carry a vast amount of extra information, international drivers' licences give no indication of previous endorsements. That puts ordinary Britons at a disadvantage. A police officer stopping a Briton with an ordinary licence can tell whether that person has endorsements; but if that person has an international licence, the police officer can tell nothing of the kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for raising that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Elizabeth Peacock 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Batley and Spen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will recall that earlier in our proceedings I made the point that those who have an Irish driving licence and a British driving licence from time to time produce one or the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
other, depending which country they are in and which one has penalty points. My hon. Friend might like to consider that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not quite the same point, but I shall try to respond to it in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to the point raised by the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) is that the international driving licence is a six-month short-term licence which gives people the facility to travel internationally with a valid licence that can be shown to authorities as they pass through frontiers. As such, it is not covered by the Bill. Were someone driving with an international licence, the chances are that that person would have had a licence at home for more than two years. There will, of course, be exceptions, but that is the general rule and would not be covered by the Bill's provisions, even if the Bill were able to include international licences. If the driver had not had a licence for two years, one would hope that in the six months of holding an international licence, during which time he or she would probably have travelled in several countries, the short time spent in this country would not have been enough to obtain six penalty points. However, I accept that there will be exceptions where that is possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dispute that what the hon. Gentleman says is the sensible response. Under normal circumstances, one would expect his answer to be the applicable one. But the reality is different. Today, we are deciding on legislation that will affect what is written on the face of the licence and there is a clear opportunity to find an easy way to get round that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We established in our first debate that there will be one or two exceptions. In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham (Mr. Merchant), we mentioned Liechtenstein and how people entering our country from there might be able to avoid the measures in the Bill. However, the Bill is the best effort that can be made to include and catch in the provisions as many people as possible. The large number of amendments that we are debating today—we debated a similar number two weeks ago—are a result of trying to improve the Bill and catch more people. But we cannot catch every person in every instance. The hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich highlighted a case in which one or two individuals might get through. I hope that that is all it will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Transport in London (Mr. Steve Norris)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On this specific point, we should be clear that a United Kingdom citizen would not be entitled to produce an international driver's licence for the purposes of disclosing a licence to the police or for the purposes of a fixed penalty notice or other criminal proceedings. Although the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich is right to say that a person with an international driving licence would be able to escape the provisions of fixed penalty notices, which are applicable specifically to those with United Kingdom licences, it should be clear that that is not a large anomaly. No British citizen would be able to take advantage of the situation that the hon. Lady described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady wants to intervene, I should gladly sit down to enable her to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0408">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to labour this point because only a tiny number of people will be involved, but the hon. Gentleman's comments were not entirely accurate. A British citizen, who had been temporarily resident abroad and who had an international driver's licence, could easily escape investigation of the points on a previous licence. That is not simply possible: I think that it will be quite likely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Lady accepts that I have attempted to answer her points as far as possible. We are not disguising—I mean myself and the Minister; or at least I hope that I speak for the Minister—the fact that there will be one or two small exceptions to the Bill, which will be caused by the very complicated nature of international travel and licensing and by the absence of uniformity of licences within Europe, let alone the world. However, the second European directive, which I mentioned earlier, will improve matters within Europe. Perhaps when there is a world union, there will be a second directive of that as well, which might makes things a lot better for the whole world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen talked about a person driving with both a British and an Irish licence, and producing whichever one suited him at any given moment. She may recall that a few moments ago I mentioned that the second directive, which is expected on 1 July 1996, will prohibit any person from holding licences from more than one member state at the same time. Holding two licences will be illegal, although I accept that making something illegal does not stop it from happening—otherwise, there would be no burglaries. However, it will be more difficult to hold more than one licence, and anyone found doing so will be prosecuted, and have one of the licences taken away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How would that information be available to a police officer? Will the police have access to Irish records?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that at the end of my remarks. If, when I have finished, I have not satisfied the hon. Lady on that point, I hope that she will bring the matter to my attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before this series of interventions, I was saying that fixed penalties can be paid only by holders of British licences. The Department of Transport is proposing, upon implementation of the United Kingdom's obligations under the second directive, to extend that to holders of other EEA licences. Penalty points are endorsed only on British licences, although a driver file is set up by DVLA for anyone who is convicted of a penalty-point offence who does not hold a British licence. That deals with the point about Irish licences. If anyone holds an Irish licence, DVLA will still set up a person file because that person would have been convicted and would have incurred penalty points. If that person subsequently applied for a British licence, the penalty points would be endorsed on that licence from the moment of issue. That should largely cover the points that were raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen and the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In summary, there will be only two classes of new driver who fall outside the scope of the Bill: holders of non-British licences—the majority of whom will be visitors or temporary residents in Britain—and holders of British
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
licences in exchange for a licence from a non-EEA country other than the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, whose licences will be in EEA format.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank you, Mr. Hill, for indulging me after my earlier false start, and for letting me go through what I consider to be important points about non-British licence holders. Clearly, I got the sequence of debates wrong, but I do not apologise for going through those points, which are very important for the implementation of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the risk of being accused of dragging out the debate, I want to make one or two brief points about this important clause. Information contained on the driver's licence is one of the most important aspects of the legislation. In a country in which vast numbers of people use the roads all the time, it is essential that drivers are capable of driving safely. If a driver has infringed the law in any way, he must not escape the due penalty and, if he is stopped by the police for any reason, it may become important that certain information is known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, even with the best will in the world, the House of Commons should not allow legislation that contains anomolies to slide through. The hon. Member for Rochford (Dr. Clark) is extremely hard-working, brilliant and caring, but I am worried about some of the clause's contents. It is worrying if there are anomalies between one sort of licence and another. Some of the examples that we have used today may be considered to be dancing on the head of a pin, affecting only a tiny number of people, but as I have made clear in my remarks about heavy goods vehicles, I am concerned about the differences that still exist and the possibilities of taking action against drivers who, for whatever reason, are licensed in one country and driving in another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, by the end of our deliberations, we shall have sorted out any real difficulties. I understand that many of the amendments that we are discussing today aim to deal with precisely that sort of omission or difficulty. However, there are two problems with this wide-ranging clause. The clause is written so as to take account of legislation that the House of Commons has not fully examined because it is contained in a directive, which will come into operation sometime in the future. In itself, that is a bad thing. We have always held out against retrogressive legislation, but to write into legislation something that has not come into operation and has not been considered fully by the House of Commons is to put us in an extraordinarily difficult situation. The clause is excellent as far as it goes, but I still believe that it could create anomolies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the information, which will be available to many people, will be of different classes in relation to different drivers and that that will enable some people to escape. As the Bill's purpose is to ensure that people do not escape and to identify new drivers who are likely to need some sort of extra supervision, it seems sad that we should approve legislation that is not properly polished. I conclude on that slightly carping note, for which I apologise, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will bear in mind those important points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Piers Merchant 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beckenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make a few general remarks in support of the clause, although it is a little difficult to pick up a debate that was started a couple of weeks ago. I want to make two main points. The first relates to what the hon Member for Crewe and Nantwich said about the imperfections in the clause and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0409">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
the international element. I agree with the hon. Lady in theory, but not in practice. I entirely support her concerns about the loopholes and the consequential effects of the international element. However, in terms of the practical impact of the Bill and the purpose of the clause, it would be a mistake to make too much heavy weather of those issues, although it is right to draw attention to them. We are talking about a very small number of people. I would hate to see the purpose of the Bill and its passage into law frustrated simply because, at the edges, it does not quite cover everything that we should ideally like it to. Note should be taken of those concerns, but they should not impede the passage of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The core of the Bill lies in the clause, which defines the vast majority of drivers who, by accumulating more than six penalty points, would be subject to the provisions relating to revocation contained in clause 3, which we have not yet debated. Most of the clause deals with the technical details of defining a licence holder and the steps to be taken if a person has broken the limit on penalty points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main provision on six-plus penalty points—which I think is about right—has a threefold impact. First, it automatically provides for mandatory additional action against those whom we can call probationary drivers—those who have recently passed their test. It is perfectly appropriate for someone who has only just passed his test to be put under an additional yoke. Secondly—to take up a point made by the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich—it is a means of ensuring that the new drivers on our roads are capable of driving. That is the purpose of the driving test and the Bill will put an additional brake on them, doubly to ensure that they are capable of driving by taking away that newly provided right to drive if they show by their actions that they are not as responsible as they should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the most important aspect of all is the deterrent effect. The measure will say in large capital letters to people who have not yet passed their test and to those who have just passed their test, "You are being watched. If you do not drive in an entirely responsible manner and if you do not abide by the laws and regulations, you will be liable to be put back to the status of a learner driver for a while." The deterrent effect of that cannot be overstated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The detail of the clause will put into effect a mechanism which will help to avoid the countless tragedies that have occurred—and still are occurring—on the roads in which innocent victims lose their lives or are seriously injured as a result of the sort of irresponsibility which it is our duty to control and minimise. The Bill does that in a major way, and for that reason I strongly support the inclusion of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Slightly carping, she says. I want to resist the notion that the clause is imperfect for a number of reasons. Firstly, as I understand it—though I defer to your view on the matter. Mr. Hill—it would not be constitutionally possible for the House of Commons to pass legislation which was predicated on anticipated future legislation which it had not considered. Although my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford was quite right to refer to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
anticipated second directive, it should be clear that the clause is entirely free standing. If the second directive were not be implemented, in no sense would the purpose of the Bill vitiated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, in our debate we might be guilty of forgetting precisely the object of the Bill. The Bill does not aim generally to provide for penalties in this country to be affixed to licences that are held in other countries throughout the world. That issue gives rise to considerable difficulty. The Bill relates to new drivers and, in that context, the hon. Lady is right to say that the number of people who might escape the provisions of the Bill would be tiny because we are only dealing with drivers in the first two years from the date on which they hold a driving licence. It must be obvious, therefore, that almost no drivers will arrive in the country within their first two years of having acquired a licence—even one from their country that is incompatible with a EEA licence—and thereby evade the Bill's conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The overwhelming majority to whom the Bill refers will be young, British people who acquire their licences, typically at age 17—although as we have already discussed, the Bill deals with new, not young, drivers—and who will be covered by the extra provision, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham pointed out, during the first two years they drive. To imply—even to carp in the gentlest way—that somehow the clause is imperfect because technically it is possible for an indvidual—in circumstances that would provoke an angels-on-pinhead debate—to evade the Bill's provisions, does not mean that the Bill should not be passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Rochford made it clear that the DVLA maintains a file on those who are convicted of offences in circumstances where subsequently they may exchange their licence for a Britsh format licence; and that, in those circumstances, penalty points that have been awarded by a court and not endorsed on the licence will be endorsed on the British licence. My hon. Friend also pointed out that only two restricted categories of drivers—so tiny as to be de minimis—could now be excluded from the Bill's provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the hon. Lady accepts the important provision that we should never let the perfect be the enemy of the good. The fact that one can construct an abstract case in which an individual can, in unusual circumstances, for a few months, evade the provisions of a Bill of such limited scope, is no bar to the passage of the clause. I strongly defend my hon. Friend and the amendments that I have introduced for producing a sensible arrangement for enforcing the essence of the Bill which, in practice, will ensure that all the aims that we are trying to achieve in terms of road safety are achieved by it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to discuss amendments Nos. 21 to 50.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The main part of the Bill covers the straightforward case of a qualified driver who has exchanged his or her provisional licence and test certificate for a full licence and is driving under that licence. Schedule 1 modifies those provisions to cover a qualified driver who has not yet exchanged a test certificate and still holds a provisional licence, although a test certificate as well. Section 89 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 allows a driver to obtain a full licence at any time within two years of passing the test. However, in the interim, he is permitted to drive free from the conditions attached to the provisional licence—that is, he need not display L-plates and, if a car driver, need not have an experienced driver sitting beside him. He has passed a test and although he is still technically driving on a provisional licence, the test certificate serves as proof of his entitlement. If he were asked by a policeman to produce his licence, he would be advised to produce the test certificate also. If he did not, he might have to defend a charge of driving otherwise than in accordance with his licence. It seems most odd that anyone who passes a driving test does not immediately send off the application for a full licence, but the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency informs me that it receives quite a lot of late applications. If the application is made after the two-year deadline, the applicant must pass another test. That happens more often than one might suppose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
All that relates to schedule 1 as drafted. The schedule does not cover another group of drivers of which I was not aware when drafting the schedule—those who pass more than one test for more than one class of vehicle. I am looking at the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) while I explain the reason for there being so many admendments and specifically the three amendments to clause 4. Loopholes in the Bill, some of which the hon. Lady tried to find in clause 2, were found in time to correct them in clause 4. They were covered in the amendments before us and I hope that the hon. Lady will give them an easy passage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Someone who has passed two tests may send in his test certificate and obtain a full licence on the first occasion, but on a later occasion he may not get round to upgrading the licence and might hold a test certificate as well as a full licence. The first question to ask is whether it matters. In some cases it could matter a great deal—for example, if someone with a full motor cycle licence then passes a test to drive a car but does not exchange the certificate. Motor cyclists are always punctual at trading in their provisional licences because they are valid for only two years, but those for cars are valid for longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a driver has his licence revoked with six penalty points, the court will return the licence to the Secretary of State, but is not obliged to inspect the test certificate because he has a full licence; it may not even know that he has a full licence; it may not even know that he has an extra test certificate. The all-knowing computer in the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency would know about it, but the agency could do nothing about it. The driver might then obtain a provisional licence but he may by then not be interested in motor cycles. He may realise that he still has the unclaimed certificate for passing his car test and could send off that certificate to the agency and apply for a full licence. Having held back his pass certificate and having got a new provisional licence, he puts the two together, sends them off and attempts to obtain a full licence for a car, to which he is not entitled. The agency staff check the computer records, realise what he has done, read the small print and conclude that they have no grounds on which to refuse the application. He is not prevented from obtaining the licence under clause 4 because he never held a full car licence. He is not prevented by schedule 1 either because his licence is not a simple provisional licence. He has slipped through the net and can have the licence he wants without taking a re-test. That is clearly unacceptable and I am attempting to stop it by means of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had hoped that the courts and the agencies would apply the main part of the Bill and schedule 1 concurrently to achieve the result that we want: unfortunately, however, life is not that simple so amemdments were clearly needed. I had not anticipated that the process would be so long and so complicated, but the whole structure of the Bill as originally written is affected, so there are more complications than we would have wished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had better explain the mechanics. Amendment No. 27 gives the schedule a new title. The schedule is to be divided into five parts: part I defines the scope; part II requires all test certificates to be produced to the court; part III is similar to the present provisions for drivers who still have provisional licences; part IV, which is entirely new, is similar in effect to part III, but deals with drivers who have full licences and test certificates; part V again deals with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0411">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
both those groups, covering much the same ground as paragraph 5(5) and paragraph 6 in the Bill as printed, but modified to take the new group of drivers into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The procedures for the new group of drivers combine those in the main body of the Bill and those in the existing schedule 1. It may not be altogether clear how the amendments to clause 4 fit into that pattern, but those, too, reflect the fact that a person may be entitled to drive some vehicles as a full licence holder and others under provisional licence conditions. The fact that a single piece of paper may serve both functions is not taken into account in the existing wording of clause 4 and is a potential source of confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may help the Committee if I give an example. Suppose a young driver passes the car driving test and obtains a full car licence, which allows him also to ride a motorcycle as a learner, as I did as a young man of 17½. It was a long time ago and my long-term memory is fading, but I just remember it. If that person's licence were revoked, rather than re-take the car test, he could take a motorcycle test and argue that it was a test of competence in driving one of the classes of vehicle that he was previously entitled to drive, and that he had therefore passed a relevant driving test and should have his car licence back as well. That is not a very strong argument, but there is some ambiguity in the present wording which it is better to remove.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention behind clause 4 is that a person whose licence is revoked under the Bill will be able to regain all the previous full entitlements by passing just one test, provided that it is one that he has passed before. The licence that he regains will be the same as the one that he lost. If the licence that he lost was provisional, the licence that he regains should not be upgraded to a full one unless he has passed the appropriate test in the meantime. The amendments will clear up any possible doubts and will tighten up the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the group contains several small amendments to clause 7 and schedule 2—which are purely consequential on what I have just described—inserting references to the new paragraphs of schedule 1. I do not think that I need say any more about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warwickshire, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise only one point, which is about the nature of the retesting. The aim of the initial driving test is to bring a driver up to what we regard as a satisfactory standard before allowing him to drive unaccompanied. Passing the test does not suggest that the driver has the level of skill that we should like him to have. However, if a driver has obtained six points during a two-year period, he has demonstrated that he is neither the quality nor the caliber
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
to be allowed to drive unaccompanied. If that were not so, we would not be seeking to revoke such drivers' licences in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question therefore arises whether the standard of the test taken on the second occasion should be more difficult, because the person who passed the first test has shown that that test failed to raise him to a satisfactory standard to allow him to drive unaccompanied. Are we to say that, despite that failure, the driver simply has to pass another test and we will allow him to get his licence back? Alternatively, are we to say that the second test should be tougher and more difficult to pass, so that the person who has shown himself to be incapable of satisfactorily driving unaccompanied will have to reach a higher standard, thus—we hope—ensuring that he is safer on the road than he was before?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the hon. Member for Rochford to tell me why he feels that we should not set a tougher test on the second occasion so as to bring inadequate drivers—as they have been shown to be—up to higher level than they have previously attained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What an interesting intervention from the hon. Gentleman, suggesting that the second test should be harder than the first. I do not know whether it would be possible in law to require two types of driving test and to make someone who has had his licence revoked take a harder, second test. It could be argued that such a driver was subject to double jeopardy, but I suppose that anything is possible in law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are already several other sets of circumstances in which people have to retake their driving test. For example, someone who has received a long disqualification for drunken driving may be required to retake their test. Drunk driving is a serious offence which may be punished with a three-year disqualification and the judge or magistrates may require that the offender retakes his test. One could extend to such cases the hon. Gentleman's argument that the second test should be harder, but that would mean that all the statutes relating to driving licences would have to be revisited and with this Bill we are trying to operate within the law as it currently stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One consolation for the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North (Mr. O'Brien) might be that, in the taking of the test a second time, one would hope that more of the learning from the test will sink in. Clearly it did not during the first test and the period of instruction preceding it, which is why the person lost his licence or had it revoked. One would hope that having to go through instruction and testing a second time would improve the person's competence to hold a licence, even though the test was of the same standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point, but I think that it is for another Bill, not this one, which is meant to operate within the current provisions of the law relating to driving licences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, noted with interest the intervention of the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North. Various points could be made in response, particularly about the Department of Transport's reaction to the Bill of my hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle of double length testing already exists, and is available, as my hon. Friend said, in certain cases, including that of persons who are disqualified in connection with offences to do with drink-driving. In
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0412">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
certain circumstances, they may have to take a double length driving test, which is, in effect, a more difficult test. That provision could have been used in the Bill. The Department of Transport did not press my hon. Friend to include that provision in the Bill, however, because, to be brutally frank, its real purpose is to impose something of an indignity on young people who have—to be pompous about it—got above themselves and developed an inflated perception of their ability to drive. They forget that the law matters and is applicable to them. The Bill seeks to address that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that there is any suggestion that the candidate will not pass on the re-test. The assumption is that young people, generally, are very competent at handling vehicles. When they return to the atmosphere of a test, they will remember what they are required to do, and will do it perfectly competently. The Bill will require them to spend some time being unable to drive without another adult driver sitting alongside them and they will have to display L-plates. Their views of their immediate future will be somewhat truncated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see the Minister's argument. However, would not there be considerable advantage in providing not just an indignity but a deterrent, by making the second test tougher?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge immediately that that is a perfectly fair point. One has to make a judgment about whether one should move immediately to a double length test or simply require re-testing. My hon. Friend chose to follow the path of re-testing in his Bill. The view in the Department of Transport is that that meets our intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Warwickshire, North will recognise that, while we are running the risk of being paternalistic in the Bill by requiring a new driver to go back to square one and to start again, no one wanted to make young people feel that they had been dealt with unfairly. It was a matter of judgment as to whether it was right to proceed with a single or a double length test. Parliament could, of course, at some future date, pass an amendment to my hon. Friend's Bill—if it reaches the statute book—which would strengthen the test. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that, having thought about the alternatives, the Department decided that the major disincentive to a young person was having to re-sit a test; we did not take the view that in general they lack sufficient skill to pass a re-test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to prolong our debate, but I should like to discuss an important matter that is germane to the clause. We have been conscious of the fact that young people constitute 10 per cent. of licence holders—though perhaps I should say new drivers, as the Bill's title states, rather than young people. In general, however, new drivers are almost exclusively young people. That 10 per cent. group causes 20 per cent, of accidents and 25 per cent. of fatalities. However, young people are extraordinarily expert at handling the machinery. They are adept—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a small point, my hon. Friend said that young people account for 10 per cent. of drivers, 20 per cent. of accidents and 25 per cent. of fatalities. I hope that he does not mind me correcting that. Young people are involved in 25 per cent. of accidents involving fatalities, but they are often not the fatalities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is entirely right. My point is that there is nothing wrong with a young driver's technical competence. That is my response to the hon. Gentleman's serious question—young drivers are extraordinarily competent at handling a vehicle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Peacock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefully to what my hon. Friend is saying about young drivers and he is probably correct. However, I am concerned that although they may be technically competent with many of the machines that they drive, they are not always competent to handle those machines at high speeds. As we all know, many small cars can reach terrific speeds and it is often at high speeds that young drivers are not competent because they do not have the experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is entirely right. My hon. Friend will recall from one of our previous debates that I referred to the Automobile Association's initiative in introducing new attitude and awareness testing for young people. The Pass-Plus programme for newly qualified drivers and the 16-plus information pack in schools, which makes young people about to obtain a licence more aware of what they are taking on, are also available. There is, of course, the second directive's theory test requirement, which will be incorporated into British law and which will raise the competence of newly qualified drivers. The key point, relative to this clause, is whether a double length test would be more appropriate than a single length test. We believe that the principal problem is not technical competence but attitude. Thus, the key provision of the Bill is the withdrawal of a licence and the subjection of the newly qualified driver to the indignity of having to rediscover the L-plate, to have a driver alongside him and so on. That is why we have not at this stage asked my hon. Friend to consider the double length test. That does not mean that, if the Act is a success and is achieving the desired effect, we could not return to the idea of a double length test if it is thought to have merit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall explain the sort of situation with which clause 5 is intended to deal. A newly qualified driver gets a conviction and the court awards him penalty points so that he now has six or more. The court sends the licence back to the licensing agency for revocation, but the driver then gives notice that he is appealing against the conviction or the sentence. If the appeal is successful, he may have the conviction overturned, or he may lose the penalty points—or some of them—to bring his total below six.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an appeal against disqualification, the driver is not automatically allowed to contine driving until the appeal is heard, but a court may order that his disqualification be suspended so that he can do so. The agency then issue him a licence stamped to the effect that it is valid only pending the appeal. After the appeal, the licence is void: either the court returns it for destruction or, if the appeal is successful, the holder can apply for a new licence which does not record details of the disqualification that was overturned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the cases covered by the clause, my hon. Friends felt that if a driver has not been disqualified outright, he should be allowed to keep his licence until the appeal is heard. So if the licence has in the meantime been destroyed, a new one must be issued free of charge. The question is for how long. The Bill says for a prescribed "temporary period". But any period prescribed will be too long for some cases and too short for others. If the period runs out before the appeal, does the agency have the power to issue another licence? If the driver withdraws the appeal, what happens if he hangs on to the licence until the period has expired?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Officials at DVLA have been advising me on these matters and have come up with a different, and I think better, solution from that in the Bill. They suggest that it is better not to prescribe a specific period of time, but simply to issue the licence for the same duration as the one that it replaces, which in most cases is until the age of 70. However, it will of course, carry the "pending" stamp. That is what the agency does for suspended disqualifications and clause 5 as it stands would not allow that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would enable the Secretary of State to provide any period of validity for the new licence, whether equivalent to the current validity or shorter. For example, it could be a period expiring on the determination of the appeal but, in any event, if the appeal is unsuccessful or abandoned, subsection (1B) in amendment No. 8 would cause the licence to be treated as revoked. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will need to make regulations and consult on them; he may as well be given a wider choice of options, and these seem to be good ones.

This is a small but important amendment. The purpose of the schedule is to deal with new drivers who hold test certificates that have not been exchanged for full licences or for additional full entitlements on licences. Test certificates cannot be exchanged if more than two years have elapsed betwen the date of the test and the date of the licence application. It may seem a slightly pedantic point, but it is better to make it clear that the schedule is concerned only with test certificates that are not more than two years old. The amendment will make that crystal clear and I hope that the Committee will agree to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The schedule has taken up rather more of the Committee's time than one would have liked and time is pressing on. I hope that my earlier explanation of why the amendments were necessary was clear and adequate. Several interventions were made on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, it is, to my mind, rather curious that people who pass a driving test do not immediately trade in their old provisional licence for a full one. Obviously, there has to be a period of grace. A driver coming away from successful test could be involved immediately in a road accident and end up in hospital, preventing him from trading in his pass certificate. Alternatively, he might be about to go on a three-month trek in India or Nepal the next day and therefore not find in convenient to trade in his pass certificate. However, there seem to be others who, for no good reason, do not bother until they really have to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The matter does not come within the limits of this excellent Bill, but perhaps the Minister and those from his Department who are present could ensure that it is made much more obvious that that action should be taken as soon as possible after the test is passed. I am not suggesting penalties, although there could perhaps be some minor penalties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. I have no doubt that my hon. Friend the Minister will respond to it in a moment. The period of two years' grace is far too long. There are genuine cases of people not being able to trade in for family reasons or because of accidents or holidays, but six months would be more than generous to cover almost every eventuality. The matter is outside the scope of this Bill, but perhaps the Road Traffic Act 1988 could be amended to take into account the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Central (Mr. Lord), to whom I am grateful for raising the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tempted though I am, it would not be easy to use a Bill such as this to change the general rule, since it applies not only to drivers in their probationary period, but to anyone who upgrades a licence following a further test. We have to work within the existing systems and we need provision to cover drivers who have test certificates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have learnt today, the matter is far more complicated than I had originally thought because of the different tests that exist for different classes of vehicle and the fact that a licence can be full for some purposes and provisional for others. Thanks to the copious amendments for which the Committee has patiently and tolerantly voted, I believe that the schedule as it now stands will cover all conceivable circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I started, I thought that it would be simple to introduce a Bill that would ensure that someone who had got six penalty points during their first two years of driving would have their licence revoked, and that would require them to take a test before continuing on their sweet and merry way. Complications grew as one spent more time considering the matter. We thought everyting was fine when the first draft was prepared, but then realised that it was not. Members of the Committee have pointed out other potential—one hopes, inconsequential—shortcomings. The Bill proved to be more complicated in its drafting and Committee stage than one had hoped.

I thank the sponsors of the Bill, most of whom have served on the Committee, and those who spoke on Second Reading and who may have a chance to speak again. Principally, I thank those who came to both of the Committee's sittings. There has been a high percentage turnout; clearly, members of the Committee believe that the Bill is worthwhile which is why they have given up their time to be here. I am grateful to all of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I congratulate the hon. Member for Rochford on presenting a good Bill, which will save lives. We strongly support it. I also thank you, Mr. Hill, for your firm and fair chairmanship of the Committee which enabled the Bill to pass through expeditiously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you. I thank both sides of the Committee for their admirable discipline, which allowed us to get on as a full Committee. The Bill is a worthy applicant for a place on the statute book. Having said that, I must return to work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
