INTERPRETATION</div> <!-- title -->
<p>Amendment moved <i>[this day]:</i> No. 5, in page 2, line 8, leave out from beginning to end of line 10.—<i>[Mr. Hague.]</i></p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris <span class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester Wythenshawe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Oh! I beg your pardon, Mr. Hogg.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would appear that points of order are now a subject for the usual channels.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Social Security and Disabled People (Mr. William Hague)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: News has now spread from the usual channels to the right hon. Gentleman. It is debatable whether things get on better or worse without the usual channels.<br><br>
I was in mid-speech and speaking to amendment No. 5, which addresses the question of the definition of the organisation of disabled people. Those are the organisations to be consulted by the commission in the course of its work. I moved the amendment because I cannot see what advantage a restriction such as the one posited by the provision would bring to the quality of information gained by the commission, or hence to the usefulness of the codes of practice and guidance that might ensue.<br><br>
I am sure that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes) would recognise the value and experience of bodies representing disabled people which perhaps do not have a majority of floating members who are disabled or whose controlling body does not contain a majority of disabled people. I have in mind bodies such as Scope and Mencap which do not meet that strict definition. The Bill appears to put them into a different category, which troubles me.<br><br>
I wonder whether the Bill's supporters could tell the Committee either now, or in writing at a later stage in our proceedings, how many organisations of disabled people meet the definition of organisations which have to be consulted by the commission on draft codes of practice. Would I be right in thinking that some organisations which we all value greatly such as Scope and Mencap would not meet the definition? Would the commission that is envisaged need to maintain a register of organisations that met the definition? If so, how would it be done? I have a number of points to raise. The distinction made in the Bill is unnecessary, which is why I have moved the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's real reason for moving this amendment to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 80</span>
delete the provision relating to organisations of disabled people has more to do with his opposition to the existence of the commission at all than to the points that he raised.<br><br>
The problem of organisations representing people with disabilities that are not themselves made up of a majority of people who are disabled seems to me to be catered for by the fact that space is left for others in the 25 per cent. that are not covered by the arrangement to be appointed, if this difficulty arose. I see no real need to concede the Minister's arguments. This all has much more to do with the Minister's general ideological objection to the role of the disability rights commision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The reason for proposing the amendment is not my acknowledged opposition to the creation of a commission but the strange distinction being made. Perhaps the hon. Member could tell me at some other time what organisations would meet the definition and how we would know which organisations met the definition in the future; but I do not want to press those points for the moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Berry <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kingswood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Minister is aware that so far he has been unable to name a single organisation of or for disabled people that is anything other than in support of the Bill. Does he not therefore rely on their judgment that this is the kind of Bill they would want? Organisations such as Scope would have no difficulty in meeting that criterion. Which organisations did the Minister have in mind when he expressed his concern?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The organisations I had in mind—I may be wrong about them and I am asking for information—were Scope and Mencap, which happen to be two well known organisations, but there may be others. I should be interested to know which organisations fall into that category. I am sure, however, that we can clarify that at another time; and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I am sure that you have sensed that there is deep unhappiness on this side of the Committee about what has happened here since we began our proceedings yesterday. I do not call into question the Minister's credentials. As I said yesterday, he has been clear from the outset about his concern to stop the Bill. No one can say that he has been anything but spectacularly clear about his intentions.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East moved his sittings motion in the hope that we might be able to persuade the Government and the Committee that it is very important for disabled people that the Bill should have a Report stage on the Floor of the House of Commons while there is still time for it to complete its many stages. Clearly, unless we can succeed tonight, it has no chance of becoming law in this Session.<br><br>
It has been said before, not by me, but by other people who have been involved for some considerable time in the proceedings on the Bill, that we are not in new territory; we have been here before. We have had every expectation of making progress with the Bill—not least that which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0136">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 81</span>
springs from having a parliamentary majority for the Bill—only to find that it has been obstructed.<br><br>
There are hon. Members on this side of the Committee who feel that the Nolan committee, which is looking at standards in public life and at what is damaging the reputation of the House, might be well advised to consider what has happened to the Bill. I know of a huge number of people who feel that the history of what has happened has degraded the House of Commons and demeaned its name.<br><br>
I ask you, Mr, Hogg, if you agree that we are wasting our time and taxpayers' money and at the same time disappointing millions of disabled people by taking part in what many people now regard as a farce?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In response to that point of order, I must tell the right hon. Gentleman that I have no responsibility for anything happening outside the House, such as the Nolan committee. We are responsible for the conduct of the House and our Standing Orders, and as long as hon. Members on the Committee meet the terms of the Standing Orders, there can be no objection to the conduct of debate. While I understand the anxiety of the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends to get the Bill through the Committee stage, my responsibilities do not extend beyond these sittings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Liz Lynne <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rochdale)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. Perhaps you could give me some advice on how we proceed in referring this matter to the Nolan committee. The behaviour of the Minister, in tabling so many amendments to try to prevent the Bill getting any further, brings Parliament into disrepute and the Nolan committee is studying such actions. At least the Minister is honest: he is acting in a way that is less underhand than what was done with the previous disability Bill. But he is still trying to prevent the Bill from reaching the Floor of the House. Could you give me advice, Mr. Hogg, on how to refer this matter to the Nolan committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no procedure for doing that. The Nolan committee is not, in my opinion, considering matters that would make it relevant to the proceedings of this Committee. This Committee, like all Committees of the House of Commons, is responsible to Members of the House of Commons as a whole for its conduct. If the hon. Lady feels that the conduct of anyone in the Committee has been in some way improper, there are procedures, of which she will be fully aware, on how to prosecute that matter further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Lynne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Hogg, for that advice. Indeed, that is what I shall do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Andrew Bowden <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brighton, Kemptown)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. I shall not go quite so far as what has been implied by Members who have already spoken. I too regret that there is no procedural way for the Bill to reach the Floor of the House of Commons. There is no doubt that the Bill has huge support among disabled people in this country and among their organisations. I congratulate the promoter of the Bill. I also believe that we shall find, in the not-too-distant future, ways and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 82</span>
means of ensuring that a Bill similar to this one reaches the statute book, to the benefit of all disabled people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That further consideration be now adjourned. I have attempted to do everything that I can to advance the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill in this Session of the House of Commons. I outlined the many problems that the Bill faced when I moved the sittings motion. I hoped that we would have an opportunity to go through the amendments steadily, with the possibility of reaching a situation in which the Bill had been through its Committee stage before the close of the House today, and could then be reported to the House tomorrow. It is now obvious to everyone that that cannot occur. It was always a huge task, given that there are 113 amendments. Progress this morning was so slow that it is now an impossibility.<br><br>
The procedures were always going to be messy today because people had different objectives in mind. My objective was to try to get the measure through, while having an opportunity to vote on certain items. The Minister has not had the same objective, as witness the number of amendments that he tabled and the extent of the debate. He has taken a different approach.<br><br>
The Minister elaborated on his points this morning and, at one stage, after he had spoken for 10 minutes and was taken to task by you, Mr. Hogg, for not relating his speech to the amendment, he moved aside one raft of papers and picked up the papers that dealt with the amendment. It is clear that we could have had even longer speeches by the Minister than the ones we heard—if that were possible.<br><br>
At least the Minister tabled the amendments in his own name. Last year, when there was a problem on the Floor of the House, the amendments were in the names of Back Benchers and came from the Department of Social Security. That was initially denied and then accepted, and apologies had to be made to the House. We have overcome that difficulty, at the price of responsibility being seen to rest with the Minister. That must be made clear, although it will not be as clear as were the problems that arose on the Floor of the House, in me glare of publicity and in front of the television cameras. We are tucked away in a Committee Room, with limited chances of explaining what occurs, which appears to those outside to be procedurally peculiar, containing details that are difficult to understand.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
It has been clear throughout that there is no willingness to facilitate the House taking decisions on principles. I have raised the matter in business questions on umpteen occasions, and by other methods. I asked a business question on me Floor of the House this afternoon about this Committee. We shall not, therefore, advance today because we know what the script would be: the Minister and his hon. Friends would elaborate on various items, and my hon. Friends and I would say as little as possible to try to avoid being provoked by the Minister into saying something that he could get his teeth into and elaborate on. That is unhealthy for any Committee.<br><br>
The Bill cannot be discussed on the Floor of the House tomorrow, which is the last practical day available for the Report stage of a private Member's Bill. However, we can still advance the Bill, perhaps in a calmer atmosphere
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0137">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 83</span>
when the Minister might be less prone to speaking at great length, and I may respond more calmly to his points.<br><br>
There will be difficulties; there may be a peculiar procedural coup which could alter the situation so that the Bill returns to the Floor of the House. However, the likelihood is that it will not do so. It will have served its purpose by returning to this Committee on Wednesday mornings, when we can further discuss the provisions and polish the Bill. It has been polished on many occasions but that does not mean that little errors will not creep in: the two references to Great Britain rather than to the United Kingdom need changing and references to various other Acts may be preferable to some of the Government amendments.<br><br>
The Bill has already been considerably tightened up, and anyone considering a private Member's Bill next year or when there is a change of Government might take note of the basis of the changed legislation. It might, however, require some further amendment, and I do not know whether there will be an opportunity to do that. The Government are ploughing ahead with their own Bill, which is now in another place.<br><br>
The nature of this Bill might therefore change in the future. The Bill might fill in the gaps, make some advances, add a commission and include provisions additional to those proposed by the Government. We must decide whether to sweep away the Government Bill with appropriate amendments on some future occasion and have the full Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill; or consider whether there is some other way to turn a sow's ear into a silk purse.<br><br>
It would facilitate the Committee to adjourn now and consider what it can do in new and changing circumstances. I have made great efforts since I was lucky in the private Members' ballot. I was approached and asked to introduce this measure, which I agreed to do unless another hon. Member who came higher in the ballot did so first, or unless the Minister could show that his Bill covered what was in the previous Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill, which he was unable to do.<br><br>
We are not deserting the field of battle by moving the Adjournment. We are facing the reality of our situation and will be in a position to salvage what we can, in a different framework, without the pressure of trying to get the Bill onto the Floor of the House tomorrow.<br><br>
Some of us should draw lessons from what has occurred. It is clear that there are inadequate provisions for private Members' legislation in the House and it is entirely inappropriate that there should effectively be only five days in which to complete the Report and Third Reading stages. We should try to amend the procedures of the House and see whether Wednesday mornings could now be made available for private Members' Bills.<br><br>
Someone from the media asked me whether the Bill was now dead. In a sense, it has been killed off by the Government and that is why I am now moving the Adjournment; but there is always such a thing as resurrection. We are interested in that possibility and if we were to pull the Bill out entirely, which was another option, we would not be in a position to engage in that resurrection. As long as the House sits, towards the end of the Session, there is the possibility of changes of heart or of alteration of the political geometry of the House. If that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 84</span>
were to happen, the Bill could be picked up and used again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly know and understand that hon. Members on the Committee have been anxious to see the Bill proceed through its parliamentary stages. As they are in favour of the Bill, their position is entirely understandable. I respect their motives. I especially respect the motives of the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East in promoting the Bill, because he has done so for the same motives that prompted me to introduce the Government's Disability Discrimination Bill—to end discrimination against disabled people. At least all members of the Committee are united about that even if we disagree about the means by which it is to be achieved.<br><br>
I think and hope that hon. Members who support the Bill understand my position: having won a majority for my Bill in the House of Commons I could not possibly say, as the Minister with responsibilty for disabled people, that I was also happy for a different Bill to be passed on the same subject. That would create a ludicrous legal position. I wonder what the hon. Member for Rochdale (Ms Lynne) would think of standards in public life if we passed two Bills on the same subject in the same Session. I shall pass over her remarks, which I consider to be a laughing stock.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Andrew Bowden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's point about the Government Bill, but I should like to make my own position clear. I voted for that Bill because I feared the situation that has now arisen and would rather that we had part of the loaf than no loaf at all. It is important to get legislation to help disabled people on to the statute book as quickly as possible, but I am afraid that the Government Bill does not go far enough down the path: we should go much further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand my hon. Friend's position, but I do not think that that is the majority view of the House, which has rejected crucial amendments to the Government's Disability Discrimination Bill by fairly substantial majorities. It is my responsibility as the Minister who has put together that Bill to try to ensure that it reaches the statute book and that is clearly not compatible with the Bill before us reaching the statute book.<br><br>
I resent and reject the implication of some remarks made by members of the Committee that I have tried to delay the Committee stage unduly. I have tabled more than 100 amendments and most of them remain to be discussed. But, as I said yesterday, 201 amendments were tabled by other right hon. and hon. Members in the Committee stage of my Disability Discrimination Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Lynne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way to the hon. Lady, because of her ridiculous remarks earlier. I do not know why tabling 100 amendments to this Bill is an attempt to block it whereas tabling 201 amendments to another Bill is not.<br><br>
The way in which we have spent our time in the two Committee sittings prior to this one is similar to the way in which we spent our time in the first two Committee sittings of the Disability Discrimination Bill. I want to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0138">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 85</span>
debate the detail of this Bill—I think that it will help to inform the debate about discrimination in this country. I am pleased that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East has rejected the other option of withdrawing the Bill. I know that some members of the Committee may have doubted my sincerity when I said that I wanted to place on record why the Government were not happy with parts of the Bill. I do want to do that, however, and I look forward to debating the Bill in further Committee sittings, providing that they do not clash with my responsibilities in Committees which are considering other Bills for which I am directly responsible. Having said that, I do not want to oppose the motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Derbyshire, Norh-East has spoken in a forbearing and constructive spirit for which I commend and admire him. I share his enormous frustration and regret that it is not possible in practice for his Bill to reach Report stage. However, I mink it entirely proper and valuable that my hon. Friend the Minister has tabled amendments to the Bill and proposed to debate it in detail. I know that he has the same objective as all other members of the Committee—to make illegal unjustified discrimination against disabled people and to bring about a state of affairs in which they are, at long last, full and equal citizens and members of our society.<br><br>
We should be willing to take on board serious, reasonable, practical and constructive suggestions that the Government have to make about elements of the Bill. It is tragic that we have run out of time for the whole House of Commons to reach a considered judgment on this Bill, which the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East has put forward as an alternative to the Government's Disability Discrimination Bill. We are victims of the entirely unsatisfactory procedures for the consideration of private Members' legislation. Those provisions urgently need reform, and reform is in the hands of the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows in what very high regard I hold him, not least for his kindness, sincerity and constancy in support of this measure over the years. Will he agree that we should make it clear, as the Minister made a numerical comparison between the amendments that were tabled to his Bill and those tabled to this Bill, that there is a profoundly important difference between Government legislation and private Members' legislation? The basic difference is that the Government can move a guillotine motion, but a private Member cannot. The tyranny of time is much less important to the Government than it is to a private Member.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman makes a valid and important point—namely, that the Government control the timetable of the House of Commons. There is a solution available to the problem with which we are confronted in Committee—the Government should provide their own time for further consideration of the bill. They could do so. There is precedent for doing that to enable the House of Commons to reach a free judgment on a matter of enormous importance. The country expects us to debate it responsibly and to reach a considered conclusion without our deliberations being frustrated by lack of time and the rules created by the House which have enabled the Government to squeeze out
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
consideration of a Bill which it does not wish to be fully considered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: How does my hon. Friend think that the Government could do that credibly in the case of this Bill as they have their own Bill and proposals for dealing with the problem?</span></p>
<p>5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would have been appropriate for the Government to allow the House of Commons to debate freely and choose between two alternative legislative means to enable us to achieve objectives which we share almost entirely. There is little between us as to the ultimate purposes; the Government need not have been embarrassed. We are a long way down the track and it would be difficult to disentangle the House's affairs along those lines now, but it would have been a possibility. It would have been good for the reputation of Parliament had Members of the House had an opportunity to consider the alternatives and make a genuinely free judgment. I believe that the House would have preferred this Bill, possibly with amendments. Supporters of the Bill have always been willing to take on board any sensible or reasonable amendment from any quarter. Our only desire is well-designed legislation to fulfill our purpose.<br><br>
I regret that the Government have used their control of parliamentary time to deny the House the opportunity to undertake consideration and reach a free conclusion in that way. Those of us who are profoundly dissatisfied and frustrated with what has occurred must renew pressure for reconsideration of the procedures of the House for private Members' legislation. In the meantime, I look forward to continuing scrutiny of this measure in Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the Adjournment motion. I hoped, like other members of the Committee, that we would be able to proceed through the Committee stage today with the doubtless optimistic hope of reaching Report tomorrow. I am bitterly disappointed that we are in this position. Not surprisingly, I strongly support the Bill promoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East. It is a matter of disappointment to recognise that we shall not have a Report stage and Third Reading tomorrow.<br><br>
The Government have behaved appallingly over the Bill. I am not talking about personal integrity or individuals, any more than I was last year. Collectively, the Government have behaved appallingly.<br><br>
It is true that the Government now seek to legislate against discrimination against disabled people. Twelve months ago, they were totally opposed to that in principle; to the notion of rights for disabled people and to legislation. I recognise that there has been movement. Over those 12 months the Government have, for whatever reason, shifted position.<br><br>
When the Minister says that his Bill has had a majority on the Floor of the House he invites the response that he knows will be given. There have been many majorities on the Floor of the House for the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill. I do not have time to list them, but on the first day of the Session early-day motion 1, calling for implementation of the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill which was tabled on a cross-party basis still had the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0139">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
support of a clear majority of hon. Members, both among those who signed it and among Front Benchers who, by convention, do not sign early-day motions. Early-day motion 1 has the support of the majority of Members of the House. It expresses support for the Bill presented by the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East. Last year, not a single vote was cast against the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill, either on the Floor of the House or in Committee. This year, not a single vote was cast against the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill on the Floor of the House, even after the Minister said that he opposed it. Last year, the hon. Member for Exeter (Sir J. Hannam), who co-chairs the all-party disablement group, moved a motion on the Floor of the House, calling on the Government to provide time to complete the remaining stages of the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill. Did the Government vote against it? No—not a vote was cast against that motion. Did the Government take notice of the resolution? No. They have taken no notice of that, of early-day motion 1, or of Second Reading votes.<br><br>
I remind the Minister that we are still waiting for an apology for the compliance cost assessment. The all-party disablement group and the Rights Now campaign have demonstrated what anybody with an elementary knowledge of facts and figures would argue; that the compliance cost assessment put forward last year to criticise the Bill was a fraud, based on, among other things, double counting and a time scale that was not in the Bill. I used to teach economics at university and I would have failed a student for that. It was a most shoddy piece of work and it clearly misrepresented the cost of the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill. The Prime Minister's assertion that it would impose a £17 billion cost on the private sector was astonishing. It was untrue and not a shred of evidence supported it. We are still waiting for an apology. It is true that the figure is no longer used in support of Government arguments, but we want an apology for it.<br><br>
One could continue in the vein in which I have begun almost until 10 o'clock, in which case the motion would no doubt fall. One almost has to smile—a nervous reaction to our predicament, having made all the same points previously, only to have the Government discard our arguments. I am annoyed by the Government's apparent lack of respect for the democratic traditions of the House. Despite debate after debate, despite our winning votes, nothing happens. The Government can lie about the cost of a Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Charles Hendry <span class='memberconstituency'>(High Peak)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman accept the democratic voice of the House, that specifically rejected the idea of a commission, put forward as an amendment to the Government's Bill? Will he also accept that the circumstances have changed markedly? He has made significant references to my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter, who clearly played an important part in supporting the Bill that he presented last year, but who this year has clearly supported the Government's Bill; who secured additional changes from the Government to make it more to his liking and who is not evident in support for the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill today. Will the hon. Gentleman accept that there has been a significant change in the way that the matter has been considered this year, and that the House has spoken on many of the matters that have been
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
raised—not always in a way that has been to the hon. Gentleman's liking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall draw my remarks briefly to a conclusion. The hon. Member for Exeter is not present, so perhaps in a sense it is wrong to comment, but I recall sharing a platform with him in Trafalgar square last year, at which a clear statement in support of the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill was made. I do not think that he would dissent from that.<br><br>
Many people have looked to the Disability Discrimination Bill as indicative of a movement in the right direction. Many hon. Members have tried in Committee and have attempted elsewhere through amendments to bring it closer to the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill. Those are matters of fact. But the bottom line is that there is a majority in the House for the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill. It has the support of every organisation of and for disabled people in the country. The amendments that have been tabled to that Bill stand in glaring contrast to the proceedings last year, when the Minister did not table one amendment to the Bill, or vote against one clause. Last year the Government had one strategy; we must assume that this year they have another. I do not criticise them for having a strategy; Governments do have them. It is its nature that I criticise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman not noticed that there has been an important change since last year, which is that the Government have introduced a Bill? If the Government embody a policy in a Bill, it is bound to disagree with another Bill which does not contain the same provisions. Does the hon. Gentleman, or any other member of the Committee, honestly expect that the Government, having secured the passage of their own Bill, could happily go along moving no amendments and raising no objections to a different Bill on the same subject?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My point was that the present strategy is different from last year's. I do not object to there being amendments to the Bill; I do object to the suggestion that the Government have a democratic mandate for their Bill but that somehow there is no such mandate for the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill. Again, a majority of Members of the House are on record as supporting the Bill; not a single vote has been cast against it, this year or last. The Bill has been maligned; it has been abused with allegations about costs in a manner so despicable as to defy description.<br><br>
If the Government were serious about the House being the democratic decision-making body in our parliamentary democracy, they would, as hon. Members have suggested, facilitate a situation whereby the Bill, and the Government Bill, were debated on the Floor of the House, giving Members a choice. It has taken so long for the Bill to get to Committee this year and there have been so many amendments to it—of course we would not deny Ministers the right to table amendments—that we have been boxed in as regards the timetable, which means that today's Bill, which has wide support, will not go to the Floor of the House of Commons.<br><br>
This is a bad day for democracy. I am a new Member of Parliament and have been here only three years. Perhaps I should get used to this happening, but I find it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0140">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 89</span>
odd, and not a little disturbing, that a Bill which has received support inside the House as well as outside it will not be able to be voted on by Members of Parliament. It does not seem democratic to me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Corbett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Erdington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I join the welcome to you as Chairman, Mr. Hogg—a little belatedly, but this is the first time that I have spoken?<br><br>
I understand why my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East introduced the motion and my hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood (Mr. Berry) will know how he feels.<br><br>
The Minister bridled when the hon. Member for Rochdale suggested that he had tried to delay the Committee's proceedings, and said he resented her accusation. I do not know why the Minister apologised: I expected him to do nothing else. After all, there is a record of his confession in <i>Hansard</i> of 10 February, when we debated Second Reading. Stating that he did not intend to ask his hon. Friends to vote against Second Reading of a private Member's Bill, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Nevertheless, I make it quite clear that the Government intend to ensure that our Bill to end discrimination becomes law and that this Bill does not." [<i>Official Report,</i> 10 February 1995; Vol. 254, <i>c.</i> 629.]</p></blockquote>
Therefore no one should be surprised. The Minister and his colleagues would do anything in whatever forums are available in the House to achieve that stated objective. Heaven knows why he thinks he should apologise. He should have apologised for the original statement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware that I apologised for anything. I have nothing to apologise for. Does the hon. Gentleman think that I, or any other Minister, can support two different Bills simultaneously? What would he think of me if I were to do so?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Corbett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is for the Minister to make his own decisions on the matter. The majority opinion in the House is that the Minister backed the wrong Bill. He gave 6 million people with disabilities, and an equivalent number of carers, the impression that the Government's Bill would make them equal citizens. The Government's Bill was not meant to do that, and the Minister knows it. The Minister owes those people an apology.</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has finished or whether he is giving way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Corbett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am giving way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If this measure has the majority support of the House, why have amendments, which would have put into the Government's Bill many of this Bills provisions, not been made? There is meant to be majority support for the Bill, but the majority never seems to manifest itself. It is democratic to introduce a Bill and ask for it to be voted on. If one has a majority in such a vote, one can claim majority support. That is what I have done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Corbett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been part of the Government for long enough to know that he has in his pocket something that my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East does not have—a gang of Whips
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
who persuade all Conservative Members who hold the Whip to support a Government measure irrespective of their views on it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister asked how the Government could support two conflicting Bills at the same time. Obviously, there is a sense in which they cannot do so. But the Government have two different roles: first, they are the Executive, implementing the policy that they have determined; secondly, they appoint the Leader of the House and, therefore, they hold responsibilities for parliamentary democracy. So when a strong opinion is held throughout the House and reflected in a private Member's Bill, they should allow such an opinion an opportunity to find some expression within the House. The House should be able to decide between opposing opinions or to reach a compromise. The Government would still have everything on their side because the Whips would be in their pocket. But the Government have gone to an exaggerated extreme; they have blocked every avenue of advancement and discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman has forgotten that he is only intervening on his hon. Friend's speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Corbett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East makes his own point about the matter. It is worth reminding the Committee that Governments have a choice when considering private Members' Bills. They can be honest and open and, too rarely, they are. They can partly oppose proposals—for example, last Friday the Carers (Recognition and Services) Bill was proceeded with by agreement between its sponsor, my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, North-West (Mr. Wicks), and the Government or they can go out of their way to obstruct and sabotage such a Bill, which is what has happened to this Bill.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) said, it is perfectly possible for the Government to provide sufficient time, including time on the Floor of the House, for the Bill to complete its remaining stages. I base that statement on experience. I was lucky in the ballot in 1975. I produced the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976, which provided anonymity for complainants—women and men—unless and until a conviction. The rows saying that such legislation never existed are phony: it was the Conservative Government who wiped that provision off the statute book. Opposition to the Bill meant that there was little time for it to complete its remaining stages. The then Leader of the House, Mr. Michael Foot, was kind enough to make a Friday available for that Bill to complete all its stages—to go to the Lords, back to the Commons and then onto the statute book. Such action is within the gift of a Government. They may not want to do it, but no one should be under the misapprehension that it cannot be done.<br><br>
We all have some understanding—vague and hazy at times—of the crazy procedures of the House. I am one of those who think that the process by which private Members' Bills go through the House is totally faulty. People outside the House—in this case, 6 million people with different abilities—had the right to expect that when my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East drew a fairly high place in the ballot, the Bill would get a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0141">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
fair wind and, in view of the efforts of my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Wythenshawe (Mr. Morris), that it stood a high chance of becoming law, perhaps with amendments.<br><br>
Members of Parliament are collectively guilty, to some extent, of misleading those people, who are insistent in their demands for equal rights. It is no good the Minister claiming the right, which no one disputes, to table amendments. We profoundly object to the weight and number of those amendments, which were deliberately designed to suffocate the Bill. We know from what the Minister said on 10 February that the death of the Bill was beyond doubt. The only thing left open was the manner in which the Government would pull it off. The Government's behaviour has been shabby.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that none of the amendments was designed with that intent. I look forward to debating all the amendments in the remaining sittings of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Corbett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is perfectly all right for the Minister to say that and pretend that he is being reasonable. He said on 10 February that he would kill the Bill. The procedural position is that unless the Bill's Committee stage was completed ready for tomorrow it was unlikely to be considered on Report—unless the Government were to provide time. That is our objection. I suspect that the Minister knows that 60 or 70 amendments other amendments are in the wings ready to be tabled before the House rises tonight, just in case we complete the Committee stage. He wants to ensure that even if the Bill was debated in the House tomorrow, it could be ambushed. The Minister should not keep apologising; he said that he did not want the Bill to become law. The Minister should have the backbone to get up and say that that is what he wants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend recall Madam Speaker's ruling? She said that she saw nothing incompatible between the two Bills. The Minister referred this afternoon to an incompatibility, but the clear implication of what Madam Speaker said was that she saw nothing incompatible in both Bills proceeding—each having a fair chance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Corbett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, my right hon. Friend is quite right. My hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East and other members of the Committee may wish to write to Madam Speaker about what has happened. Someone also mentioned making a reference to the Nolan committee.<br><br>
I feel strongly that we have not played straight—the Minister will have to live with this, although I take collective responsibility for it—with the 6.5 million people with different abilities. The Minister will take the stick for that, and he will deserve it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I seek your advice. If we agree to the motion, when will the Committee next meet?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At a date to be appointed by me. I shall clarify that at a later stage of our proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose in his place and claimed to move,</i> That the Question be now put.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have not debated the matter for an hour—we have 15 minutes until then. I shall be inclined to accept the hon. Gentleman's motion at 20 minutes to six, but not before. I am a one-hour man.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg. You have behaved impeccably as Chairman of the Committee. The frustrations that Committee members who support the Bill feel are not directed at the fact that you have had to preside over procedures which are clear, but which have been totally discredited by the events of the past two days.<br><br>
When the Minister and his Parliamentary Private Secretary, who, we were told, normally does not speak, said that—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful for the Committee to know that I have not been the Parliamentary Private Secretary of my hon. Friend the Minister for the past three months. Had the hon. Gentleman been listening to the debate during the early part of our proceedings, he would have heard the Minister make that clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not an especially important point. If I am wrong, I withdraw my remarks, but I understand that the hon. Gentleman is a Parliamentary Private Secretary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That makes the position even worse. For a Parliamentary Private Secretary to another Minister to speak in a Committee in the way that the hon. Member for High Peak has is outrageous.<br><br>
I say bluntly to the Minister that if he thinks that all the money that the Government have spent in promoting him and their outrageous policies has been worth while, he has another thought coming. The Minister seems to think that that is a laughing matter. If the Minister and his hon. Friends were right, Mr. Robert Hayward would still be a Member of the House. The main reason that he is not is that he was rejected by his former constituents in Kingswood and defeated again in a by-election because of the outrageous way in which he abused the procedures of the House. We have seen such behaviour repeated today by the Minister and his two hon. Friends the Members for High Peak and for Beaconsfield. Happily, other much respected Conservative committee members have spoken in favour of the Bill.<br><br>
The hon. Member for High Peak made an outrageous point. He said that the House had rejected the case for a commission. That underlines the difference between the two Bills; Madam Speaker and the House were aware of the difference. Even the Prime Minister showed that he was aware of it when I intervened during his speech on the Queen's Speech. We are dealing with two very different Bills.<br><br>
The House's decision on a commission was carried by 13 votes, compared with other defeats of 20 and 30 votes on the same day. That decision was taken in the context of the Government's Bill. The House has never had the opportunity to take such a decision in the context of the Bill promoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East except on Second Reading, when the Bill was endorsed by 175 votes to nil.<br><br>
As I am sure they will demonstrate in Greenwich tonight and in Whitehall tomorrow, disabled people and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0142">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 93</span>
organisations of and for disabled people are not fools. They understand parliamentary procedure and they know when it is being prostituted and exploited, as it has been over the past two days. They understand, as does Madam Speaker, that the Government sought to introduce a Bill that would mean improvements and amelioration. We had to fight as hard as we could to get U-turns from the Government on two issues—education and transport—with which they did not intend to deal.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
There is a difference between a Bill that aims for improvements and amelioration, and my hon. Friend's Bill which, consistent with the aims of my hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood and my right hon. Friend me Member for Wythenshawe, unashamedly sought to introduce a Bill of Rights for disabled people and recognised anti-discrimination principles in a way that the Government do not. The Minister said today that the Government sought to end discrimination. Not only did they not do that in their Bill, but they introduced new discrimination, especially in the aspects of the Bill relating to employment.<br><br>
This is a sad day for democracy and for disability and a caring society. Let there be no doubt that the timetable, which meant that today the Bill has been killed, had the support of the Government and the Government Whips. The hon. Member for Rochford (Dr. Clark) told me that he had not chosen tomorrow as the date for the Report stage of his Bill; the date had been chosen by the Government Whips Office.<br><br>
The Government tabled about 100 amendments, knowing full well that the Committee could not complete discussion in the time available, and then shamefully conceded to my questioning that they had tabled still more amendments for tomorrow, notwithstanding the fact that Government Whips had made sure that two other Bills would go before my hon. Friend's Bill. The Government shamefully abused the procedure of the House and restricted the right of Parliament to introduce an antidiscrimination Bill.<br><br>
The anger of the Committee will go well beyond these walls. We will hear it tomorrow from disabled people. It is an anger based on the fact that civil rights have already been achieved in America under President Bush, because the veterans of Vietnam influenced public opinion. We know that progress on civil rights is being made in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and other countries, but it is denied to our people for reasons that the Government have never explained.<br><br>
The British people support 6.5 million disabled people and their carers. The Government's shameful behaviour over my hon. Friend's excellent Bill—I pay tribute to his courage—will provoke the British people into seeing that we have a Government, led in this Committee by that Minister, who exercise the arrogance of intellect and the brutality of power. The British people will not ignore that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Lynne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to support the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East. There is no point in sitting further today, as the Minister is well aware. By tabling so many amendments, the Government have managed, yet
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
again, to kill the Bill. We know that it will not get to the Floor of the House.<br><br>
The Minister may have liked his reputation for being a nice man, but he must know that it has been sorely tarnished by what he has done in Committee and by tabling so many amendments. He has every right to table amendments; nevertheless, it is a shoddy tactic to table so many when he knows that, by doing so, he will kill the Bill. The Rights Now campaign said that it was amazed at the Minister's tactics. I share its distaste and anger and that of disabled people throughout the country. Yet again, the Government have used such tactics to kill off civil rights for disabled people.<br><br>
The Minister laughed when I said that me matter should be referred to the Nolan committee. I do not understand why, when such behaviour brings parliamentary procedure into disrepute. I believe that the way in which the Committee has been handled by the Government should be referred to the Nolan committee. Most members of the Committee who support the Bill will be doing just that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly partly to defend myself against the comments of the hon. Member for Monklands, West who said yesterday that I was only put on the Committee on the ground that I would not speak and who suggested that, as a Parliamentary Private Secretary in another Department, I was not entitled to speak on a matter involving a different Department. That is patent nonsense. The only rules are that as a PPS, I do not speak on the Department in which I work for a particular Minister. As someone whose background is working as a special adviser in the Department of Social Security for a different Secretary of State and as someone who has taken an interest in these matters, I have every right to comment. I rather resent the suggestion that because I disagree with the hon. Member for Monklands, East and the way in which he wants to push forward the Bill, I have no right to speak on it. Such remarks do him no credit and he may want to consider that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister in a Committee usually requires the services of his or her Parliamentary Private Secretary. Why were no moves made to ensure that the Minister's PPS was included in the Committee even if that was in addition to the hon. Gentleman?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I cannot answer that. When I was put forward to attend the Committee, I was indeed me Minister's Parliamentary Private Secretary. I welcomed me opportunity to speak in the Committee and it is regrettable that, because my circumstances have changed, members of the Committee believe that it is unacceptable that I should be allowed to speak.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help. My hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East was acting in accordance with precedent. In previous debates in Committee on such Bills, the promoter has arranged for the Minister's Parliamentary Private Secretary to attend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have listened with great care to the question whether the Minister's Parliamentary Private Secretary should speak; whether or not he was me Minister's PPS; and whether a PPS from another Department can speak on subjects that are not his
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0143">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
departmental responsibility. None of these matters impinges on the question whether the Committee should adjourn. My tolerance is being stretched on this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the superb and generous way in which you have chaired the Committee, Mr. Hogg, the last thing that I want to do is to stretch your tolerance. I shall confine myself to the motion before us.<br><br>
It has been said that there was a clear majority for the Bill, but, in saying that, people are simply transferring the mood of the House from one year to another. There was a majority in the House for a poll tax, but we would not have one now. Because there was a majority for the Bill last year does not automatically mean that there was a majority this year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me make progress. There were 175 hon. Members who voted in favour of the Bill, which is less than one third and not much more than one quarter of the House. Others have indicated support for it, but many Conservative Members who supported the Bill last year believe that the Government's Bill goes far enough to satisfy their concerns. Because they supported the Bill last year, it cannot be simply taken for granted that they would automatically support this Bill this year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may or may not be right that there has been a shift in the mood and preference of the House—but is not the point that the House should be allowed the opportunity to consider, fully and freely, the alternatives before it and to make its own judgment? Of course the Government are entitled to prefer their own Bill, although I wish that my hon. Friend the Minister had preferred the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for High Peak is entitled to speak in debates, but surely the House ought to be entitled to full and free consideration of the two Bills presented to it. That is our complaint.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that what most people, most organisations representing disabled people and disabled people themselves would have wished is that, the Government having dramatically changed the entire landscape, we should be given the chance to see how the Government Bill works through.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If subsequent changes are required, the House should come back and address them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am answering the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon. When the House was given the opportunity to vote on a Government Bill, it passed that Bill—overwhelmingly, since I believe no hon. Member voted against it. We should have the chance to see how it works out before seeking to change the landscape all over again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am continuing with my point. In correspondence that I have received from my
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
constituents, many of those who wrote to me last year, asking me to back the Bill of the hon. Member for Kingswood, have written now to say that they are pleased and satisfied with the Government's Bill. Only people from a Derbyshire organisation involved with disability have disagreed with that—but that was an organisation that considered the Royal National Institute for the Blind, Scope and Sense to be organisations that suppressed, rather than represented, disabled people. Many of my constituents who have a direct interest in the matter would prefer to see how the Government's Bill progresses before seeing further changes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Chairman is keen for us to address ourselves more directly to the motion. But with his tolerance, I shall give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am keen to intervene.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not clear about what is happening. Is the hon. Gentleman giving way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. He made a number of statements that were simply incorrect. Let us take just the last one. He asserted that organisations of or for disabled people felt that the Government's Bill was better than the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill or that the Government's Bill should be given some time to be implemented so that one could then see what happened. Can the hon. Gentleman name a single organisation of or for disabled people that has adopted that view? Every organisation for disabled people that I know of has come out very firmly in support of the civil rights Bill and against the Government's Bill. They have expressed a clear preference. Could the hon. Gentleman please justify his statement?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That was a very long intervention. What I would be interested to hear is the answer to the question about whether the Committee should adjourn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the best thing that I can do is speak to the hon. Gentleman outside the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, tell us now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Chairman has made it clear that he wishes us to confine ourselves to the motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. All that I want is for hon. Members to address the question before us and to do so in order. I certainly do not want to get involved in such squabbles about who said what to whom—it is beginning to sound like Irish politics.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly welcome the proposal of the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East to give greater subsequent consideration to the concerns about the Bill. I hope that one of the issues that we address then will be the point raised by the hon. Member for Kingswood. When the Government's Bill was proposed, it was clear that

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 97</span>
there were many organisations representing disabled people who thought that the Government had gone infinitely further than they had hoped. One person said that she was "gobsmacked" by how much the Government had offered. Many such people also said, privately, that they would be quite happy to have one Bill this year, because their resources would be stretched in dealing with two.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is maligning the organisations—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am clearly suggesting that many organisations would have been happy to see the Government's Bill this year and, perhaps, to see a revised version of this Bill next year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I understand that the hon. Member for Kingswood feels strongly about the matter, but he must not intervene in such a way. It is certainly out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I look forward to the opportunity to debate the Bill further in subsequent weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Lynne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not give way to the hon. Lady, because her remarks have been more outlandish, more out of order and more outrageous than those of any other member of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Lynne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. Will the hon. Gentleman withdraw that comment? All my remarks have been in order. If they had not been, I am sure that you, Mr. Hogg, would have brought me to order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, I would have brought the hon. Lady to order, but making outlandish remarks is not out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I suggested that the hon. Lady's remarks were out of order, I was using an entirely nonprocedural and non-parliamentary term. I shall, however, not give way to her.<br><br>
I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Bill further. I very much understand the sincerity of the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East and the way in which he has presented the Bill. His commitment to the subject is well known throughout Derbyshire. I hope that we can conduct our debate in a more constructive way in the future than it has been possible to do so far, and that we can make progress by proposing sensible amendments that I hope will be dealt with positively.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I wish to state some of the ways in which the Government have been less than helpful in connection with the Bill. It could have been dealt with in a Committee other than Standing Committee C. I will continue to see whether there is a vacancy in another Committee. Despite the Government's not having a heavy legislative programme, they have always ensured that another Bill was to be discussed in Standing Committee when my measure could have slipped in.<br><br>
It would have been possible to have another Standing Committee for private Members' Bills. What is happening to the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill is happening to other Bills, such as that which received a larger majority on the Floor of the House than this Bill—the Wild Mammals (Protection) Bill. Yet that Bill is about two places behind this measure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did my hon. Friend hear the disturbing disclosure from my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West about the hon. Member for Rochford, who said that his Bill was being handled by the Government? It was drafted by the Government, but the hon. Gentleman was instructed about the date when future proceedings could take place on his Bill. That is very disturbing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have been waiting in a queue for the Bill to be discussed in Standing Committee C. The Bills in front of us had the Government's support and, clearly, the Bill of the hon. Member for Rochford has the Government's backing. As I said when I introduced the sittings motion, I received a letter from the Minister for Transport in London asking whether I would introduce that Bill. It has been floated. I responded by saying that if the Government would provide more time for measures to be dealt with in the House, there would be no need for them to contact left-wing, socialist Members of Parliament and ask them to introduce their measures.<br><br>
The money resolution, which the Government so generously agreed to, was approved at the last possible moment on a Tuesday, which meant that I could not hope for the Bill to be debated in Committee on Tuesday, because it could not be discussed until the money resolution had been approved. If the Government had not presented the money resolution, there would have been massive trouble on the Floor of the House—because the Government would have been blocking the Bill openly, rather than doing it in the method that I have described—but they were not willing to face that. In one sense, I wish that they had not presented the money resolution because then the Government's position would have been obvious, but instead, they sought to keep things quiet by tucking them away in Committee.<br><br>
There is also the fact that, having come to Committee, we could have had a reasonable number of amendments that seriously tried to make drafting improvements and technical improvements, and to raise points for debate. The Government could have presented their opposition in stand part debates, voted against each measure and put forward their arguments.<br><br>
Despite the fact that the Government's tactics have worked to stop the Bill from reaching its Report stage tomorrow, the Bill is not procedurally dead. Given the House's ability to reflect its will upon the Executive, there
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0145">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
is still an opportunity for the Bill to make progress. That is why we should adjourn now and make progress on some other occasion. We must keep on at the Government until they bring the Bill forward. The will of the House must be expressed because the Government are supposed to have some sort of interest in parliamentary democracy.</span></p>
