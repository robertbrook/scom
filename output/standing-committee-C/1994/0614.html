	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Elletson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blackpool, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 20, after 'person', insert '(a)'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take the following: Amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 22, after '1948', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) a person in charge of—
	<ol>
	<li>any dog while being used for sporting purposes,</li>
	<li>any dog while being used for the capture or destruction of vermin,</li>
	<li>any dog while being used for the driving or tending of cattle or sheep,</li>

	<p>Amendment (a) to the proposed amendment, in paragraph (b) (iv) after 'area', delete 'or'.</p>
	<p>Amendment (b) to the proposed amendment, at end of paragraph (b) add—

	<br><blockquote><p>(vii) any dog while being used to assist any person for whom there is a medical or therapeutic need for such assistance.'.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>Amendment No. 4 in page 1, line 22, after '1948', insert

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the point of order made by my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough (Mr. Sykes), I wonder whether it would be in order, during the Committee, for me to refer to my hon. Friend as my faithful Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we discuss the amendments in more detail, I shall take this opportunity to welcome you, Mr. Hill, to the Committee. I have had the pleasure and privilege of serving under your chairmanship on a previous occasion, on the Hedgerows Bill. I remember your majestic presence, which reminded me of a bull mastiff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt, Mr. Hill, you will be familiar with the temperament and character of the bull mastiff, which is outlined in the "New Observer's Book of Dogs". It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The temperament of the bull mastiff combines high spirits, reliability, activity, endurance and alertness … He should not appear cumbersome"—</p></blockquote>
I am sure that you do not, Mr. Hill—
	<br><blockquote><p>"although he is a very powerfully build dog."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may have to change that description as the Committee goes on. I may find some teeth from somewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that you will, Mr. Hill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The description continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The skull should be large and square with fair wrinkle when interested"</p></blockquote>
I see your fair wrinkle now, Mr. Hill, and I shall endeavour to ensure that we keep it on your countenance during the Committee's sitting. I am sure that my hon. Friends will be disturbed and disappointed if your fair wrinkle, even briefly, disappears from your countenance. We would be extremely alarmed and would immediately return to order and the point at hand. In my case, the point at hand is to discuss the amendments tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two amendments tabled in my name deal with the problem of working dogs. That problem was revealed to me during a consultation period held after the publication of the Bill with organisations such as local authorities and pressure groups that have expressed an interest in the Bill and, indeed, support for it. Amendment No. 2 would remove a potential flaw in the Bill. It would exempt from its scope those persons who are in charge of working dogs of the types listed in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0252">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
It is important that the Bill should achieve the maximum public support and acceptance. Although it may not be immediately apparent to all hon. Members, dogs, dog fouling and issues relating to dogs, such as dog bans and dog leads, can create much public concern and emotion. I know that the hon. Member for Burnley (Mr. Pike) is well aware of the problems and emotions that may be associated with dog issues and dog politics. It is important that any Bill that would regulate or improve regulations relating to the control of dogs should have widespread public support and acceptance. By and large, I think that the Bill has managed to achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has, however, been substantial—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I interrupt to clarify a rule, not mine but a rule of the House. Hot drinks, eating of any sort or the reading of magazines or newspapers is not allowed in the Committee Room. The Clerk has pointed out that there is a steaming cup in the Room that will have to be removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hill. I shall content myself with a simple bowl of water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By and large, the Bill has achieved substantial public support. However, some concerns have been expressed, particularly by the agriculture community. It has expressed the view that the Bill should expressly exempt persons in charge of working dogs. That is precisely what amendment No. 2 would do. It would exempt
	<br><blockquote><p>"a person in charge of—
	<ol>
	<li>any dog while being used for sporting purposes,</li>
	<li>any dog while being used for the capture or destruction of vermin,</li>
	<li>any dog while being used for the driving or tending of cattle or sheep,</li>
	<li>any dog while being used on official duties by a member of Her Majesty's Armed Forces or Her Majesty's Customs and Excise or the police force for any area, or</li>
	<li>any dog while being used in emergency rescue work'."</li>
</ol></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Pike 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Burnley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the broad drift of the amendment, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will explain what is meant by
	<br><blockquote><p>"any dog while being used for sporting purposes".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that point. Obviously, we do not want to be drawn into discussions about the rights or wrongs of particular sporting activities, such as hunting or shooting, or any other activity involving dogs. It is not the preserve of the Committee or the amendment to deal with the rights or wrongs of such activities. However, we should make it clear that the Bill will not be used to discriminate against those who are in favour of such activities. Therefore, it is perfectly legitimate to include that category in the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that reply. I accept what he says. If the amendment is accepted—I recognise the difficulties that we are in—I hope that it will not imply that I or other hon. Members support certain of
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
the sporting activities in which dogs are involved. I accept that those issues must be debated on another occasion. I want to make it clear that if we accept the amendment, we would not be saying that we support hunting or any other sport involving dogs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and I am sure that the Committee will note his concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee will agree that in the limited circumstances under which the amendment might apply certain categories of person in charge of dogs will be exempted, who by the nature of their employment or occupation might be thought to have a reasonable excuse. It would clearly not be desirable, for example, for police officers involved in an emergency to have to concern themselves with dog faeces and pooper-scoopers. It would also be wholly undesirable for Army officers, fire brigade officers or ambulance workers, who might on occasion use a dog, to have to concern themselves with the dog's toilet habits. That would be ludicrous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Surrey, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is strange that my hon. Friend should single out Army officers for exemption from the requirements of this excellent Bill. I am sure that all members of the Committee will often have seen Army officers in full uniform striding down the high street of their local town with a labrador pulling them along by the lead, and I see no reason at all for Army officers, in uniform or not, to be exempt from the requirements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I advise the promoter of the Bill to ignore some of these interventions if he is to make a serious attempt to deal with the issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to deal with my hon. Friend's point, Mr. Hill, because although it is not an especially serious intervention it graces our proceedings with a certain levity, which is not unwelcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is self-evident that Army officers should be exempted. It would be ludicrous, for instance, if a military parade featuring a regimental mascot were suddenly to veer off course because the sergeant major had to retrieve a pooper-scooper from his uniform to clean the pavement or the side of the parade ground or any area that the local authority had designated as one where the national offence of dog fouling should apply. My hon. Friend giggles, clearly recognising the absurdity of his suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Banks 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be aware that I, among others, have had occasion to use dogs while serving in the Army, but not necessarily on official duty. Will he make it clear to the Committee that the clause refers to all members of Her Majesty's forces, whether commissioned or not, and that the exemption applies to them only when on duty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that serious point, of which I am sure that the Committee will take note.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chesham and Amersham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0253">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
congratulate my hon. Friend on promoting the Bill. He has referred to members of the armed services, who in the main are extremely fit, strong young people. Does he agree that the same exemption should perhaps apply to an elderly person in charge of a dog, who is incapable, perhaps for medical reasons or as a result of the normal passage of time, of bending down to dispose of something that his or her dog has left behind?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend but I am afraid that I cannot help her on this occasion. She has tabled an amendment and I shall deal with her substantive point a little later. As she will see, however, I do not think that it would be appropriate to make the sort of exemption that she suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other categories that would justify exemption. It would be unreasonable to expect a shepherd, cowherd or swineherd driving a flock of ewes cows or pigs to carry a pooper-scooper to deal with the deposits of his dog. The Bill would not apply to many shepherds. Even if an over-zealous local authority tried to enforce it on shepherds, landowners could exempt them. However, such a problem might arise in a limited number of cases that involved common land. Therefore, it is sensible for the amendment to spell out the exemptions and thus avoid doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal briefly with the amendments that my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham tabled. Amendment (b) to proposed amendment No. 2 seeks to exempt
	<br><blockquote><p>"any dog while being used to assist a person with hearing impairment"—</p></blockquote>
that is a strange proposal, but doubtless my hon. Friend will explain it later—and,
	<br><blockquote><p>"any dog while being used to assist any person for whom there is a medical or therapeutic need for such assistance."</p></blockquote>
The amendment is unnecessary and would not improve the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand why a hearing impairment should affect a person's ability or desire to clear up after a dog. In 99.9 per cent. of cases, one establishes that one's dog has defecated through eyesight. We would see our dogs running to the nearest lamp post or bush; we would not hear them. Therefore, amendment (b) sub-paragraph (vi) is curious. I look forward to listening to my hon. Friend's case for exempting people with hearing difficulties from the provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also proposes that dogs that accompany wheelchair users or fulfil a medical or therapeutic need should be exempt. Subsection 1(a) provides for "reasonable excuse". That would cover anyone who, through a medical condition or physical incapacity, could not reasonably be expected to clear up after a dog. The Pet Advisory Committee, among other organisations, believes the amendments to be unnecessary. It said:
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where such a physical incapacity does exist, a person should be exempt by virtue of Clause 1(a) of the Bill which provides that a person shall not be guilty of an offence where they can demonstrate that they have 'a reasonable excuse' for failing to clear up after their dog."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefully my hon. Friend, with whom I broadly agree. However, there are always complications when "reasonable" is used in legislation. I would be grateful if my hon. Friend could explain what it means in subsection 1(a). Who, in his opinion, will determine what it means?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend said, the word "reasonable" is well known to the law and it is, in the final analysis, the courts which decide what is or is not reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman speak through the Chair. It will be easier in the end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I apologise Mr. Hill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was saying, my hon. Friend's second amendment is probably covered by the clause. Equally, amendment No. 4 suggesting that people cannot be expected to remove or dispose of faeces because of a medical condition is similarly covered, as has been accepted by outside organisations that I have consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 3 concerns persons aged 65 or more and my hon. Friend has suggested again this morning that such people should be exempted. The amendment unnecessary; indeed, in part, it undermines the Bill. Senior citizens are among the most responsible dog owners and are more likely than others to comply with the law. The Blackpool pensioners group in my constituency has written to me to say how much it supports the Bill and I am sure other hon. Members have had similar letters from pensioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Britain's older citizens are likely to be offended by irresponsible behaviour among other dog owners. The reasonable excuse clause adequately protects anyone who has a physical difficulty with clearing up from receiving a fixed penalty. The amendment is well-intentioned but goes far beyond what is reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Pet Advisory Committee states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Providing a blanket exemption for all those aged over 65 would exempt almost one in seven dog owners and appears an unnecessarily broad exemption. Clearly, where an older citizen would have a physical difficulty in clearing up after their dog, the exemption provided by Clause 1(a) of the Bill should apply. It is worth pointing out that older citizens are often the most responsible of owners who have no objection to clearing up after their dog."</p></blockquote>
I look forward to hearing my hon. Friend speaking in support of the amendments but reiterate that it is up to her to prove her case. I regard the amendments as unnecessary. In addition, one of the partly undermines the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Welcome to the Chair, Mr. Hill. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North (Mr. Elletson), I think it a great pleasure to have a man of such experience and wisdom there when we are talking about emotive subjects. Dogs rouse stern emotions in dog owners and in those who suffer from the little deposits dogs leave behind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for bringing a hot drink into the Committee, Mr. Hill. I was unaware of the rule and I am sorry if I caused offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I start by declaring an interest: I have a small dog called Tizzy. I am not sure whether she should be entered in the Register of Members' Interests, as her value to me is far in excess of the Register's limit. I found her on the moors. Obviously her former owner was not a responsible dog owner, but Tizzy is now happily ensconced in the Gillan household. As a dog owner, I have experience and understanding of the subject, and as 1 live in central London I am on the receiving end of the result of many dogs being walked on the pavements. I spent some time training my dog to use the gutter. She is a good dog and goes towards it when she has to do something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments probe the wording of the clause. As I said earlier, I applaud the spirit of the Bill, as all responsible dog owners would, but we should consider the issue of exceptions. Dogs are owned by 25 per cent. of the population. There are more than 7 million in the United Kingdom. Of those, 1.75 million are owned by people aged over 65.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment (b) relates to dogs used to help people with a hearing impairment. I disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North about such people being able to establish clearly that a dog has deposited faeces. Hearing is part of a dog owner's awareness, and someone who is profoundly deaf may not be able to hear or be otherwise aware that his or her dog has left something behind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hearing dogs for the deaf are a special type of dog.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend say precisely what she means by someone being able to hear something that a dog has left behind? This is a sensitive subject and we tread round it with great delicacy for fear of unpleasant consequences. Surely, the sensory facilities that a person uses when a dog deposits faeces are nasal and visual. Hearing has nothing to do with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend obviously has little experience of dogs. I assure him that, depending on the dog's diet and its predisposition, most of a person's senses are used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may not be a dog owner but I have plenty of experience of what dogs leave on the pavement outside my house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is probably referring to something that was left earlier for him to find, not to
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
something that is deposited on the pavement when he is present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whatever is left behind, I certainly cannot hear it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Two hon. Members cannot stand up at the same time. The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham is not giving way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not giving way, Mr. Hill, but I am happy for what my hon. Friend said to be on the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An exception should be made for people who use hearing dogs. Approximately 300 of the 7 million dogs are hearing dogs, so we are not asking for an enormous concession. It costs about £2,500 to train one of those dogs but they are carefully selected and they alert severely or profoundly deaf people to the everyday sounds which hearing people take for granted, such as alarm clocks, door bells, telephones, smoke alarms, baby alarms and cooker timers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ray Thomason 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bromsgrove)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like other hon. Members I declare an interest in that I too am a dog owner. My hon. Friend's amendment refers to a dog
	<br><blockquote><p>"being used to assist a person with hearing impairment".</p></blockquote>
The Bill gives a specific definition of blindness but there is no such definition of deafness. Can we accept the amendment when there is no clear indication of when a person may be deaf and reliant on a dog? Could my hon. Friend address the issue of defining when a person is using a dog for such purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I was about to go on to talk about the organisation Hearing Dogs for the Deaf and its training centre in Lewknor. The dogs have a comprehensive and selective training and their owners should be excluded from clearing up after them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hearing dogs for the deaf scheme has been in operation only since 1982 and it is independent of any Government grant. The work is funded entirely through the generosity of the general public, companies, clubs and so on. The contributions go into a general fund and it is not possible to sponsor or buy a hearing dog for any individual. The policy enables applicants to be treated fairly in strict rotation. The cost of training such a dog is £2,500 and the training programme continues to expand. We should take notice of this type of dog and, for the reasons that I mentioned earlier, allow a specific derogation for the deaf or profoundly deaf person with a dog.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The owner will not always miss what the dog is doing while it is out being exercised. But on that one occasion when the person does not hear or see what the dog is doing, as the dog is a working dog it would fall under the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0255">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North, I shall therefore continue to press amendment (b) to add sub-paragraph (vi) to that amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of my amendment (b), which adds sub-paragraph (vii), states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any dog while being used to assist any person for whom there is a medical or therapeutic need for such assistance."</p></blockquote>
I had some difficulty in preparing the wording of the amendment. The dogs to which I am referring are known as PAT dogs and their role is wide and varied. The acronym PAT stands for pets as therapy. When reading some of the stories about PAT dogs I was impressed by the way and the circumstances in which they have been used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are 7,700 registered PAT dogs visiting homes for the elderly and schools for handicapped children across the United Kingdom. Dogs go into hospitals, hospices and schools. They help with children who are frightened of dogs, perhaps because they have been bitten, and they are asked to do quite a lot of work by their owners in order to meet the demands of the society in which they live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pets that are used as therapy for stroke victims, people recovering from accidents, phobic patients and others, should also be exempted and their work should be recognised. If a PAT dog is being used in a hospice, in the grounds of a hospital or in a situation in which those responsible for the dog at the time are not physically capable, an exemption should apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North will consider supporting the amendments, especially as they are in the spirit of amendment No. 2, which he tabled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not hear my hon. Friend addressing the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North about the effect of clause 1(1)(a), which refers to a "reasonable excuse for failing". That seems to cover just about all the points that she has raised, some of which are important and should be borne in mind. Does she agree that they all fall within the spirit of the intent of the provision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that timely intervention. I am looking for precisely that reassurance, and in that sense the amendment is probing, to ensure that the cases that I have outlined are covered by that wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have the same worries as my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East (Mr. Ainsworth) about the interpretation of "reasonable excuse" and I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North will give me the reassurance that I seek about the derogations for the working dogs that I mentioned, which were, after all, offered exemption under amendment No. 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to amendments Nos. 3 and 4. Of the 7 million dogs owned in the United Kingdom, 1.75 million
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
are owned by people older than 65. I have not been able to establish any further statistics, but there are 10 million UK citizens aged over 65, so a fair proportion of our senior citizens own dogs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not take a great mind to realise that as people get older bits of them start to work less well and they experience specific problems associated with aging, such as hernias, back pain, arthritis and the inability to balance. I see Opposition members of the Committee laughing, but it is no laughing matter. As people age, they start to suffer from aches and pains and other difficulties. I can see that I am now getting some attention from Opposition Members, who are beginning to acknowledge the truth of what I say rather than to laugh at it. It is a serious point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: is the hon. Lady aware that many pensioners who suffer in all sorts of ways would be absolutely appalled if their dogs left the road in a disgraceful state? They go though considerable pain to make sure that they clear up. Why should we create an exemption for people in general when the vast majority would not want to be exempt in any case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that elderly dog owners are extremely responsible, but I should like the hon. Gentleman to give me the statistics to support his statement. I am trying to ensure that an elderly person who has a dog as a companion, who cannot bend over and is unable to operate a pooper-scooper—I hate that phrase and the thought of seeing it embodied in legislation horrifies me—would not be caught by the Bill. That is not the spirit behind the Bill, but I want to ensure that such people are not caught.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have done some research on the conditions that I have mentioned, such as hernias, and non-specific back pain which is one of the largest single causes of working days lost in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point, but she will know that her amendment relates to people who are over 65. Therefore, it has nothing to do with working days lost. My hon. Friend simply makes the point that people of all ages have disabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
She should deal with that problem rather than with the agist exemption of the type that she has tabled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that hon. Friend is mistaken. I am speaking to amendments Nos. 3 and 4. Amendment No. 4 refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any person who due to his medical condition cannot reasonably be expected to remove or dispose of the faeces".</p></blockquote>
In speaking to both amendments, I am not being agist. Far from it. I am trying to cover all those who may suffer from conditions that would prevent them from doing what the Bill would require them to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

ownership? I am the father of two young children who play on open spaces and who, therefore, face a health risk from dog faeces. It is little comfort to know that they may be infected with a serious disease by a dog owned by someone who is unable to clear up after it. Should not the hon. Lady spend a little more time underlining the responsibilities associated with dog ownership rather than trying to create loopholes in the Bill that may be exploited by people who are not the genuine cases to which she referred?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Responsibilities go with dog ownership and with the parenting of children. I wish to exempt people who have a genuine problem in disposing of what their dog leaves behind, not irresponsible dog owners. That is why I support the spirit of the Bill. However, I do not want the Bill to put an onerous burden on a frail, sick person who has a dog for companionship and comfort. We should explore such problems through the amendments, so that we can ensure that the assurances that I seek are put on the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Coffey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stockport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the hon.

They will not be prosecuted if they have a reasonable excuse for failing to remove the faeces.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the circumstances that I have described will be covered by clause 1(1)(a).

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I saw one or two hon. Members look a little confused when my hon. Friend mentioned the case of Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart. Will she remind us of the nature of that case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far be it from me to go into detail on Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
not all the arguments in the Committee as it is virtually impossible to decide who has won a particular point as a result of what has been said. I think that I am right in saying that the judgment applies to ministerial statements made during the course of the Bill.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but the hon. Gentleman is wrong. The judgment applies to the Member in charge of the Bill.

I have probably spoken for far too long, but I feel strongly about the subject. Many people—or their children—have contracted extremely nasty diseases from dogs' faeces. I do not want to give the impression that I oppose the Bill, but I want to advocate caution to ensure than it does not catch some of the weakest in society who often turn to four-legged friends for solace. I will continue to press the amendment until I receive some assurances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Burnley has asked me to accept a manuscript amendment to amendment No. 2. Should the Committee vote on amendment No. 2, I shall accept the manuscript amendment, copies of which will be available from the Clerk. Members may speak to the manuscript amendment during the debate. The manuscript amendment is to leave out line 3 of amendment No. 2, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(i) any dog while being used for sporting purposes".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hill, for stating that you are prepared to accept the manuscript amendment if amendment No. 2 is pushed to a vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, I do not want to make a great speech on the merits or demerits of hunting and other sports that use dogs. If I did, you would rightly rule me out of order, Mr. Hill. However, it would be wrong not to express my views on the matter and other members of the Committee support my point of view. Therefore, we do not support proposed subsection (4)(b)(i). I do not accept that hunting is a "sporting purpose"; it is barbaric. Although I do not want a lengthy debate on that matter, the acceptance of the manuscript amendment for discussion has given us an opportunity to make our views clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Member for Blackpool, North spoke about the amendments, he referred to my experience in Burnley. The hon. Gentleman fought the 1987 general election in Burnley and he knows about the problems that arose from Burnley's dog ban in parks in 1976. I was a councillor then. The amendments that the hon. Gentleman has tabled show the difficulties of framing measures about animal issues, which are extremely emotive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0257">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Sir Paul Beresford)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman clarify the manuscript amendment? He wants to remove the word "sporting" from amendment No. 2. "Sporting" could include hunting, dog trials and shows. The definition could be broad and the manuscript amendment may cause problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept and understand the Minister's point. It supports my point that it is difficult to legislate with ease on animal issues. The problems that dogs cause by fouling in public places occur throughout the country; people want to see an end to the problem. I have served on Committees that discussed whether to introduce dog registration schemes, whether dogs or irresponsible owners caused problems and so on. The hon. Member for Blackpool, North knows that irresponsible dog owners cause the problems. I accept that deleting line 2 of amendment No. 2 might cause definitional problems. The hon. Member for Blackpool, North had a similar difficulty when he included the phrase "sporting purpose". Amendment No. 2 was only tabled on Monday. It would have been in the Vote Office yesterday, but I did not see it until today. To incorporate clear, precise wording on the matter is difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to delete line 2 of amendment No. 2 because I believe that hunting and similar activities are wrong. I accept that there is a difference between hunting and shows, trials and so on. But it would be difficult to formulate an amendment that the Chairman would accept at this stage. That is not a criticism of you, Mr. Hill; all members of the Committee appreciate the problems. Today is the first occasion on which I have been able to get a manuscript amendment accepted and I am grateful for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want the Minister to lead us into a long argument about dog sports because I agree with the broad objectives of the Bill; that is why I agreed to be a member of the Committee. I say, in good faith, that the hon. Gentleman's mistake was to have only Conservative supporters of the Bill. Many Opposition Members share his views on the issue and would have been prepared to support a measure that had all-party support rather than one that was dominated by Conservative Members. I shall not make an issue of it; I do not want to waste the Committee's time. We want to make progress so that the Bill will pass through the Committee and become law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has produced a manuscript amendment, at short notice, which would make a significant change. It would affect many people who try to organise sporting activities that involve dogs, not just hunting and shooting. The hon. Gentleman owes us an explanation; will he consider carefully what he really means by "sporting" and further clarify the matter? He should consider, too, whether it is appropriate to table an amendment in this form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I knew the hon. Member for Bromsgrove when he was chairman of the Association of District Councils. He is trying to draw us into issues in which it is not necessary to get involved today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Blackpool, North whose Bill has
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
been in the House for some time, tabled a material amendment of considerable importance on Monday for debate today. I say, for the hon. Member for Bromsgrove, that I am opposed to sports such as hunting and similar sports in which dogs are used in a barbaric way. If the hon. Gentleman does not understand that, he is dafter than I thought he was and I do not think he is daft. I give him the credit of understanding exactly what I want the amendment to achieve. I say to anyone else who tries to make an issue of it that they know exactly what I am getting at.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman appears to have cast aspersions on the timing of the tabling of the amendment. Will he make it clear that the amendments were tabled in a proper and timely way? It is not a bad thing that they were tabled on Monday—quite the reverse. It means that my hon. Friend gave much thought to them. Will the hon. Gentleman put on the record that he is not casting aspersions on the fact that the amendments were tabled on Monday?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know why Conservative Members, including the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham, are making such an issue of what I am trying to do. I did not cast aspersions. I said only that the hon. Member for Blackpool, North could have tabled the amendments earlier, as he knows. We knew only last week that the Bill was coming into Committee today. I do not say that in a critical way; I say merely that if the amendments had been tabled earlier, we could have tabled amendments to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not claim that the wording of my amendment or that of the hon. Member for Blackpool, North is perfect; there are flaws within them. I am making the point that no one on the Conservative Benches could have any doubt about the type of sport I refer to. I am entitled to make my views clear and that is what I have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to my previous arguments about dog legislation. With his involvement with Burnley, the hon. Member for Blackpool, North will know what difficulties there were in deciding which parks would be involved and in implementing the scheme. The Bill faces similar problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham could be covered by clause 1 (1) (a). That could also cover amendment No. 2, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Blackpool, North. If we leave aside the paragraph (i) of the amendment which deals with
	<br><blockquote><p>"any dog while being used for sporting purposes",</p></blockquote>
we could argue that the categories in the amendment could be covered by the provision for "reasonable excuse" in the clause. Therefore, they would be covered by the Bill as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, if a policeman, a Customs and Excise officer or a member of Her Majesty's forces—they are covered by paragraph (iv) of the amendment—are with a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0258">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
dog as they chase a criminal, no one would expect them to stop and clear up anything that the dog did at such a crucial stage in its working life. That is unrealistic. However, the hon. Member for Blackpool, North must recognise that if the policeman is walking in a town centre with a dog, he should treat the dog in the same way as any other citizen would. The same applies to Customs and Excise officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand why the hon. Member for Blackpool, North tabled an amendment to cover working dogs. I do not want to make a great issue of it. However, the provisions in subsection (1) (a) regarding a reasonable excuse would cover almost all the cases that the hon. Gentleman has in mind. That provision means that the people referred to in the amendment would not have to clear up after a dog in reasonable circumstances. It would be nonsensical to believe that a shepherd working in a field would not be made exempt under that provision. The same applies to dogs used for the capture of vermin. The aims of amendment No. 2 would be covered by subsection (1) (a).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I have sat on Committees considering Government Bills, there have been many arguments about what is reasonable. I do not think that what this Conservative Government are doing is reasonable. Perhaps the hon. Member for Blackpool, North is more reasonable than the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made some good points. Does he think that it would be wholly unreasonable for a local authority to designate a field full of sheep as one of the areas to be protected under the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. Such problems can be overcome. It is possible that amendment No. 2 is not necessary. Perhaps, having heard the arguments, the hon. Member for Blackpool, North will not press it to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that grazing rights may be given to land that is open to the public and that a working dog may be involved on that land? Although the hon. Gentleman suggests that the amendment may not be necessary, it may be required in those circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may wish to develop that point if he speaks in the debate. I believe that the Bill covers such cases in most aspects without the need for amendment No. 2. If the hon. Member for Blackpool, North believes that the amendment will improve the Bill, I am prepared to listen to his arguments. However, the provisions of the Bill as they stand, which have been reinforced by interventions from Conservative Members, underline the fact that it may not be necessary to press amendment No. 2 to a Division. I would not then need to move the manuscript amendment because there will be nothing to amend if amendment No. 2 is not accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the points raised by the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham. I want to be quite speedy because I do not want to delay matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred earlier to Burnley borough council. If memory serves, the hon. Gentleman was the leader of that council for some years and may have been involved in pioneering work in that local authority. Regrettably, some members of the Committee did not entirely understand the exchange between the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North. Could the hon. Gentleman elaborate a little so that the whole Committee can understand his point about the work that he was involved in in Burnley?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I became leader of the council as a result of the dog ban, because a leader lost his seat and I lived opposite one of the parks with a ban. I learnt a considerable amount from that and people went to prison because of the dog ban, but I do not want to waste the Committee's time going over incidents that, while they are quite interesting and could be discussed at leisure, are not relevant to our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham is a down-to-earth working Conservative Member of Parliament and I shall therefore do her the justice of believing that the amendments that she tabled are probing, not wrecking amendments. Had I not known the hon. Lady, I would have said that they were wrecking amendments, because the proposed exemptions would clearly tear great holes in the Bill, which I support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that his interpretation of my motives is correct. The amendments are not intended in any way, shape or form as wrecking amendments, but are designed to enable us to discuss certain problems that may arise from the detail of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, it is a great shame that the hon. Gentleman did not tell us the story about the elephant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall mention it briefly. Someone took an elephant for a walk in the park, because elephants were not banned, which shows that some people know something about the dog ban in Burnley parks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the hon. Lady for making her position clear. My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) made the point that people over 65, as referred to in amendment No. 3, are conscientious and would not want a general exemption. I suffer partially from industrial deafness—that is partly why I talk so loudly, but I also do not want anyone to miss what I say—so I could be classified by some people as having a hearing impairment, as referred to in amendment (b) to the proposed amendment No. 2. I do not think that I should have an exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady has pressed the promoter of the Bill on the issues raised by the amendments and I am sure that he will respond. I certainly support his view that the categories referred to in amendments Nos. 3 and 4 and in amendments (a) and (b) to amendment No. 2 are more than adequately covered in the general provisions in subsection (1)(a). The more complicated we make the Bill, the less
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0259">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
workable we make it. If the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham were to push the amendments to a vote, I should certainly vote against them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join those who have welcomed you to the Chair, Mr. Hill. I well remember the benign eye that you cast on my own private Member's Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North is indeed fortunate, as are we all, to have you with us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the clause stand part debate may allow a wider discussion of the nature of the Bill, which raises important issues that the Committee should consider at some length. My hon. Friend will know of byelaw provisions which local authorities take advantage of. I hope that he can tell me precisely where the Bill improves the status quo. The hon. Member for Burnley has spoken with eloquence and some coyness about his clearly traumatic experiences in the area. I must say that my hon. Friend the Minister and I had no such problems when we were members of Wandsworth council and introduced a popular and moderately successful dog warden scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had an elephant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had an elephant as well. The problem with the scheme—which, I suspect, will affect my hon. Friend's Bill—is that it is extremely difficult to catch culprits. This morning, I left the house, closed the door behind me and found evidence on the pavement. But catching someone in the act is difficult, as is proper enforcement of measures such as these, however well-intentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some sympathy with those who say that amendment No. 2 and the others are dealt with by clause 1(1)(a) which provides a "reasonable excuse". However, it would be helpful to have specific activities in the Bill that are exempt, although I recognise the danger that specifying particular areas begs questions about activities that are not on the face of the Bill. We need to explore further how far the amendment is covered by what is in the Bill and I look forward to hearing my hon. Friend explain that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Burnley has been astonishingly successful in enabling us to debate his manuscript amendment through your generosity, Mr. Hill. I do not, will not and cannot support it for several reasons. I am sorry to hark back, but I well remember that when we discussed hedgerows during the passage of my private Member's Bill Opposition Members say a sinister link between wishing to preserve important hedgerows and those who enjoy jumping over hedgerows to pursue foxes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unreasonable to try to use the Bill to make a point about a completely different issue. The motivation of the hon. Member's amendment is suspect. In addition, it is deeply flawed, as he has almost admitted. For example, it is ludicrous to think of a greyhound race being stopped by some official rushing on to the track with a pooper scooper to clear up any misfortune that has occurred. That is the
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
sort of problem which the hon. Member's amendment could all to easily cause. Although he is making a point about which he feels strongly, he knows that this is not an appropriate way to tackle the issue. It would make the Bill something of a laughing stock, which we do not wish to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that my manuscript amendment is not perfect, but would the hon. Gentleman also accept that amendment No. 2 is not perfect? Does he really believe that policeman walking round on normal duty when there is no crisis should be excluded from observing the law that every other citizen would be expected to follow?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, but policemen do not usually wander about with dogs when carrying out their normal duties. When dogs are there, it is for a specific purpose. One clearly would not want that important work to be interrupted by an official with a pooper scooper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not a little difficult for a policeman who happens to be going around on official duty at all times to carry a pooper scooper which he presumably throws on one side when he is about to arrest some criminal with the assistance of the dog? That is hardly a realistic proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree. My hon. Friend makes an extremely valid point in his customary forthright manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I probe my hon. Friend's line of reasoning? Does he agree with me that it is also unreasonable to expect either a dog warden or a Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals officer who is in the process of capturing a dangerous or a loose dog also to have the burden of clearing up after that dog while going about his business? That has not been discussed so far in Committee, but does he consider that that instance is in the same vein as the others we have discussed here today?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. It brings us back to the point that I was making that concerns the hon. Member for Burnley about the validity of the amendments that my hon. Friend has tabled. By specifying the categories that he has done, he has begged questions about people such as dog wardens and RSPCA officials who are not included in the Bill. There is uncertainty, perhaps even disquiet, about the amendments, not because of what they include but because of what they do not include.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Returning to the manuscript amendment, even if it were perfect we would still be left with subsection (2) which covers dogs being used for the capture and destruction of vermin. Would hunting, which the hon. Member for Burnley clearly does not like, be covered by that part of the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0260">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not think so, but there will be many people who do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. Foxes are classified as vermin, and hunting could therefore be taken into account in that subsection. The hon. Member for Burnley may like to consider that, too. I think that it is better to stick with the Bill as it stands. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about whether the defence of "reasonable excuse" might be deemed to work in the courts in these circumstances. The future of the amendment will depend on what he has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much always depends on what Ministers have to say: I would not demur from that remark. I am beginning to feel slightly self-conscious about raising the issue of vermin with the hon. Member for Burnley as it might give him ideas that I would not wish him to have. Indeed, even now, he may be jotting down another manuscript amendment to delete another part of this important Bill. No doubt, since you are in such a benign mood, Mr. Hill, you might even be tempted to permit him to get away with yet another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The more that the hon. Gentleman pushes the case, the clearer the overriding factor becomes: it is better to reject amendment No. 2 totally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From that point of view, it has been an extremely interesting debate. As my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North said, we must listen carefully to the Minister's comments on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall discuss the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham. As she will have gathered from my interventions, I have no sympathy whatever for the amendments, which seem to me to be otiose and to blow substantial loopholes in the Bill. The idea that one needs one hearing to be in perfect condition to know whether a dog has—I am tempted to use language that you might find unparliamentary, Mr. Hill, because appropriate euphemisms are so unpleasant—defecated on the pavement is farcical. It calls to mind the memorable remark made by the great conductor Sir Thomas Beecham. He was asked by a young music critic, "Sir Thomas, have you ever conducted any Schoenberg?" Sir Thomas looked at him, scowled and said, "No, but I have trodden in some." The merits of my hon. Friend's amendment is on a par with Sir Thomas's estimation of the music of Schoenberg.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It causes me no displeasure that my hon. Friend will not support my amendments. I hope that he realises and recognises that part of the reason behind tabling those amendments was that we should not single out a section of society who may have a disability for a derogation without considering seriously other sections of society with different disabilities who may also fall prey to the provisions of the Bill. It was in that spirit that the amendments were tabled, not least to praise the excellent work done by hearing dogs, which are few in number, but thankfully growing. The Committee should have their attention focused on the work that those tremendous dogs
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
do, after extremely expensive training, all of which is provided for by voluntary money. Those dogs make such a difference to people's lives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has a distinguished record of work done on behalf of people with disabilities. The Committee recognises that fact and will recognise that her amendments are tabled in good faith, on behalf of good causes. That does not alter the fact that they are unnecessary for the purposes of the Bill. She said that she tabled the amendments by way of probing the Bill's intentions and I know that she will not wish to force the issues. I hope that she does not think that anyone believes that she is motivated by anything other than compassion in tabling the amendments. That does not alter the fact that they are wrong, and indeed, covered by the "reasonable excuse" clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was slightly concerned at one of my hon. Friend's comments, in response to an intervention from the hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham). Like him, I am the father of small children and I have letters from my constituents who feel strongly that it is distressing and unpleasant to have one's children exposed to the filthy substance of faeces, which seem to become more prevalent every year, especially in urban and suburban areas. My hon. Friend implied that somehow that was the fault of parents. But parents do not leave deposits of faeces on pavements for small children to tread on or fall into. Irresponsible dog owners must bear the blame. The Committee must not be led to believe that parents are responsible for the problems that the vile and irresponsible practice of leaving deposits of faeces in public places cause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Bill as drafted. If the hon. Members for Blackpool, North and for Chesham and Amersham have tabled amendments so that we can discuss issues in Committee instead of on Report, that may be an admirable tactic. However, I hope that the hon. Member for Blackpool, North will have second thoughts about pressing the amendments because they spoil the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should aim to persuade everybody to behave responsibly. My experience of pooper-scooper schemes is that when the majority of people observe them, the social pressure on the remainder is high. When people are encouraged to believe that they are exempt from the scheme, it begins to crumble. Two sensible exemptions are already included in the Bill: "reasonable excuse" and permission. We should leave it at that. The debate has shown that as soon as one tries to work out what constitutes a reasonable excuse, one finds that the excuse may be reasonable in some circumstances, but unreasonable in others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned pooper-scooper schemes. Will he elaborate on those schemes and the way in which they work? Could he also comment on the motos crottes scheme that operates in Paris and, I believe in Lewisham?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be drawn into discussion
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0261">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
about those schemes because we have already spent time on them. I want to concentrate on amendment No. 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley about hunting, but we do not need to discuss that at length. I am worried by proposed subsection (4)(b)(i), which would exempt
	<br><blockquote><p>"any dog while being used for sporting purposes".</p></blockquote>
What does the hon. Member for Blackpool, North mean by sporting purposes? When I was first elected to the House, I was Member of Parliament for an area that is now represented by my hon. Friend for Stockport (Ms Coffey). I had an irate constituent who was worried about a neighbour three doors down the road. Every morning at 7 o'clock, the neighbour would let the dog out. The dog defecated on the grass verge in front of the house three doors away. In spite of the dog warden's attempts to persuade the neighbour that such behaviour was antisocial, nothing could be done because the dog defecated on the grass verge, not the pavement. The Bill would solve such problems. But what would happen if the neighbour let the dog out at 7 o'clock and had a bet on whether it would defecate outside No. 9 or No. 7? Would the dog have been used for a sporting purpose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has invented a new national pastime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is a sporting purpose? It is foolish to try to include such a provision in the Bill. Does it refer to hunting or to other activities? The hon. Member for Blackpool, North would do better to stick to "reasonable excuse". Most magistrates can exercise some common sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Proposed subsection (4)(b)(ii) refers to "the destruction of vermin". Some of my constituents regularly claim that they go ratting in the vale; they take lurchers with them. Although there are some rats in Reddish vale, my constituents do not often find them. If one claims that one is in the vale with a couple of lurchers to catch rats, is one exempt from the Bill? Again, it would be foolish to put that in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all accept that if a policeman is on active duty, it would be very silly to apply the Bill's provisions to him. However, a police handler with a dog has a duty to make sure that the dog gets good exercise. Most handlers take great care of their dogs and they take them out regularly for exercise. In addition, the vast majority of them are very responsible. They clean up after the dog has defecated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an obvious difference between exercising the dog and chasing criminals. Therefore, it would be foolish for the hon. Member for Blackpool, North to include the categories listed in amendment No. 1. It would be even more foolish to consider other exemptions, such as those of age and health. Magistrates can easily take such factors
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
into account when deciding whether a person has a reasonable excuse. The more we try to define what might be an excuse, the more we weaken the effect of the words "reasonable excuse". I ask the hon. Member for Blackpool, North not to accept the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham and not to press his amendments to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North on introducing the Bill. It will avoid the confusion and flaws that exist in present legislation. The very fact that it has been so widely supported by Conservative Members meant that when my hon. Friend introduced it, there was so much instantaneous support that he did not need to look for Opposition Members to support the Bill. I listened with great care to the hon. Member for Burnley. The Committee reflects the measure of support that the Bill received in the House. My hon. Friend did not aim to make it a terribly partisan Bill; it is important for the constituents of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North referred to problems that were more to do with dog owners than the dogs themselves and I agree with his remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to deal with some of the amendments but, first, I wish to pick up on some of the points that have been made in the debate. I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish who, unfortunately, has momentarily left the Committee. I have some sympathy with one of the hon. Gentlemen's points. It will be necessary for the Department of the Environment to make regulations should the Bill become law; I hope that the hon. Gentlemen's points on that will be picked up by my hon. Friend the Minister. I am particularly sympathetic to the hon. Gentlemen's view that to give practical effect to the Bill's provisions, it will be necessary for the Minister to make regulations setting out the procedures so that local authorities can designate the areas where offences will be committed if dogs foul the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish expressed concern about the informal discussions that will be held so that the Department of the Environment can consider the opportunities that will result from the Bill. I agree with him about that but not with his other remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the hon. Member for Burnley on his first success in having a manuscript amendment accepted for consideration. I mean the hon. Gentleman no discourtesy. The House quickly takes the measure of right hon. and hon. Members. The hon. Gentleman's criticism was not fair. My hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North did not table his amendment deliberately late. I was pleased that the hon. Member for Burnley was kind enough to suggest that he himself might have been quicker to table his manuscript amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To make it absolutely clear, there was no implied criticism in my remarks about the timing. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I merely said that it could have been done earlier. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] That bleeper is nothing to do with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0262">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman for putting the record straight because I was convinced that that was the case. It was unfortunate that the hon. Member was interrupted by the bleeper of the hon. Member for Stockport who has momentarily left the Committee. But the point has been made and I am grateful to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one considers amendment No. 2 and the manuscript amendment it seems that on balance my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North has the matter about right. I applaud my hon. Friend for tabling his amendment because one of the important factors in a private Member's Bill is to have a light touch. My hon. Friend was lucky enough to gain a high place in the ballot and to be able to introduce the Bill, which is important to all our constituents, certainly to mine in Southport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Attempts to overlegislate or to bring in a Bill that is too complicated are fraught with the dangers of procedure and the variety of vested interests. Despite the light touch that my hon. Friend has shown in bringing the Bill this far, we have seen the dangers that my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East mentions of hon. Members seeing all sorts of sinister things. My hon. Friend described the difficulties that he encountered with his Bill on hedgerows. Some Opposition Members saw a hedgerow as something that might be preserved only for hunters to jump over. That was not the point of his Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North is doing his best to achieve a light touch to ensure that local authorities have the opportunity to introduce fixed penalty schemes, and so on, which I hope will move us into the 21st century as too often local authorities are constrained in taking the action that they would wish to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 2 is important; it would remove flaws and confusion. I have compared it with the clause as drafted and, on balance, I believe that it is right to be more specific about the circumstances in which an offence is committed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of proposed subsection (4)(b)(i), which refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any dog while being used for sporting purposes",</p></blockquote>
my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North has made it clear that we are discussing not just the activities mentioned by hon. Members, but dog trials and shows—usually, although not exclusively, in the countryside—which the League Against Cruel Sports would applaud and encourage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware of the Westminster dog of the year, an annual competition held in gardens close to the Palace of Westminster under the auspices of the National Canine Defence League? My dog was one of the runners-up in the competition and although she behaved herself admirably in the park, there might have been difficulty at that event, which was definitely for sporting purposes, if the proposed arrangements had had to be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a pertinent point, underlining my argument that sporting activities do not take place only in the countryside. Many events, including the one to which my hon. Friend referred, take place in urban areas. There is no Machiavellian characteristic in the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North; it would remove the existing confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate my hon. Friend on the success of her pet. She has an advantage; I make no such declaration of interest. My family no longer has a dog, but if my wife has her way, we shall have several pit bull terriers. She wants to buy a pug for someone who already has one and who wants to call them Margot and Midge, although I cannot think why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to amendment No. 2. It is not sufficient to leave the clause as drafted, with the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"he has a reasonable excuse for failing to do do".</p></blockquote>
It is important to be more specific.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East referred to proposed subsection (4)(b)(ii) which would exempt
	<br><blockquote><p>"any dog while being used for the capture or destruction of vermin".</p></blockquote>
The Committee is not packed with members of the British Field Sports Society. I am not a member, although I was born in the country and have some understanding of the matters in question. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East has argued that the proposal could allay the anxieties that hon. Members have discussed, although the manuscript amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Burnley, seeks to prevent that proposed subsection from being included in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hillsborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been a lot of talk about country sports and the countryside. When I read the Bill, the first thing that concerned me was clause 1(2), which describes any open space. In fact, we are only discussing open spaces that a local authority wants to designate as an area where dog fouling is not permitted. Most responsible dog owners whom I know use open access woodland to exercise their dogs. The Bill will enable that practice to continue. The emphasis that the hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Banks) puts on sporting activities in the countryside is stretching the point—running with the hare—because most of those areas are unlikely to be designated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for expanding on that point, but I ask her, "Why not?" If we are not careful, we shall be in danger of getting into a bureaucratic nightmare. Why does the hon. Lady suggest that we should have a local authority designating, for example, an urban area, yet not seeking to designate areas that are not urban? Surely there is a contradiction there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not me trying to designate anything, it is the Bill. The Bill states that the local authority has the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0263">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
responsibility for designating areas. I would be astonished if any local authority chose to designate, for example, Wharncliffe Chase, near me. It is several square miles, with acres of woodland and open countryside and a considerable amount of field sports, and dogs are allowed on that land. It would be totally impossible to enforce the Bill in such an area because dogs are free to exercise. My point against the hon. Gentleman is that the Bill is best kept simple. Therefore such references to sporting activities in this or that area will lead only to complications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the hon. Lady for expanding her views, which will be recorded for all to read. I agree that it is necessary to have a light touch in the Bill, but I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North has had just that. It might be possible for an owner, occupier or other person—other than a local authority—having control of the land to consent to future regulations not applying to their land. There are two sides to the argument, but I do not want to take up too much of the Committee's time. I am grateful to the hon. Lady and I shall now make some progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that one of the problems in the countryside is the question of common land? He rightly suggested, as did the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mrs. Jackson), that most land will be covered by exemptions from landowners themselves. They can exempt themselves or their guests, as I shall outline when we get to the clause 1 stand part debate. There may be a slight problem with common land, particularly if a local authority, for reasons best known to itself, decides to designate an area of common land that may be used by shepherds to graze their flocks. One of the aims of the amendment is to deal with precisely that limited set of circumstances in which problems might arise. My hon. Friend the Member for Southport (Mr. Banks) has correctly identified that as an area of concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful for that clarification. As you, Mr. Hill, made clear, my hon. Friend, rather than the Minister as was suggested earlier, is steering the Bill. I want to return to my hon. Friend's point about the shepherding of animals and to have a slightly wider discussion when we reach the clause 1 stand part debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Proposed subsection (4)(b)(iv) concerns whether members of Her Majesty's forces should be exempted. I think that it is important not to over-legislate; I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North that the clause is important and that we should make progress. We may be able to allay some of the concerns that have been expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is pretty non-partisan and some of the concerns of Opposition Members about field sports seem to be coming out of the woodwork. That explains the manuscript amendment. It may be a first for the hon. Member for Burnley, but may I say how right you were, Mr. Hill, to select that amendment. Your decision showed considerable fairness. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East may
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
have referred to a sinister link, but there should really be no link whatever. In sporting activities—dog trials, dog shows or the events referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham—one cannot expect one group of participants in an entirely lawful activity to go around with pooper-scoopers clearing up all the muck and another group, also following perfectly legal pursuits, which are of concern to some Conservative Members as well as those of other parties, to be subject to an entirely different set of rules. I have never hunted, but I know that hunting is perfectly lawful, so why should those engaged in it be subject to different regulations from anyone else? To avoid flaws and confusions, amendment No. 2 should remain unaltered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to mention a couple of other points before moving on to amendments Nos. 3 and 4. The hon. member for Burnley spoke sensibly; I understand his arguments and know that he will have been pressed by some of his hon. Friends to table the manuscript amendment for debate, but I do not think that we should become muddled over what my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North seeks to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I increasingly feel that there are attempts by Conservative Members to filibuster the Bill. I made a point which can be voted on. If I had been trying to sidetrack the Committee from the main issue, I would have made a long speech to support my amendment. I accept that there are different views and I have accepted from the beginning that you, Mr. Hill, did not wish us to go into a sideline debate on the issue covered by the manuscript amendment. I have listened to the debate and my view is that we should vote against amendment No.2. If pushed to it, I will vote for my manuscript amendment. I hope that we can make some progress soon because I genuinely want to see the Bill out of Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made his position clear. I did not mean to provoke him and I understand his point. There is no attempt by me or, I am sure, by my hon. Friends to filibuster and waste time. Were I to do anything that was not in order, I am certain that you, Mr. Hill, would quickly bring me to heel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that we have not intended to filibuster, but to discuss in detail the implications of the Bill? At one stage, the hon. Member for Burnley was the only hon. Member sitting on the Opposition Benches. We have not been blessed at all with the company of the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I m glad that my hon. Friend has put it on the record that the hon. Member or Southwark and Bermondsey is not here. That does not surprise me. One never knows where one is with Liberal Democrats.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. My hon. Friend will forgive me if I say that it would be fair to point out that the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey wrote to me to say that he would have some difficulty in attending the Committee. He hoped to come for the first

	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
half hour, but I appreciate his difficulties and think his absence reasonable. He has been speaking at a conference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that clarification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. friend the Member for Blackpool, North for that point; the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey, is, nevertheless, not here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Burnley made it clear that he had listened to the debate and was ready to vote. Of course he has not listened to the debate; I have a few more remarks to make on the amendments and I suspect that some of my hon. Friends may also seek to catch your eye, Mr. Hill, and to address the amendments with the brevity that I have shown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman may be in a hurry to get away at One o'clock, but a number of important issues remain. I shall turn now to clauses 3 and 4—[Hon. Members: "Amendments."] I mean amendments; I am glad that hon. Members are paying attention to what I am saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham were fair. Making points via probing amendments, as she has done this morning, is the duty and right of every hon. Member. I do not entirely agree with her, but I thought that my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East was a little unfair in his comments. If he thinks that I am being unfair, no doubt he will have something to say. I do not believe that the amendments are necessary. If we want to use a fairly light touch, we should leave clause 1 as it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend castigates me for being unfair, but then agrees with my view. I am sorry that he thinks that I was unfair to my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham. If he wishes to persist with that misconstruction of my views, perhaps he will explain himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not mean to rattle any cages. I disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham, but I shall do so in my customary diplomatic and polite manner. I think that she is wrong. Providing a blanket exemption for all those over the age of 65 would be inappropriate. She referred to the fact that such an exemption would encompass one in seven dog owners. That information is correct. Such an exemption would be unnecessarily broad.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as I am aware there are approximately 7 million dogs in the United Kingdom and approximately 1.75 million dog owners who are over the age of 65. I agree with my hon. Friend that a large percentage of dog owners are over retirement age.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said one in seven, but I take note of my hon. Friend's figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case of an older citizen who has difficulty in clearing up after a dog has fouled the pavement has been
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
adequately covered by my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North. The exemption in clause 1(1)(a) should apply. It is important to point out that older citizens are often those who have no objection to clearing up the mess made by their dog and that they are often the most responsible dog owners. Therefore, clause 1(1)(a) should remain as it is. That underlines the point that I made and the light touch that my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North used in drafting the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 4 is what I would term the medical condition amendment. I listened to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham with care. There are many registered disabled people in my constituency; Southport has one of the oldest populations in the British Isles. When, because of a medical condition, a person cannot reasonably be expected to remove or dispose of faeces, clause 1(1)(a) should apply. When listening to my hon. Friend's remarks, I wondered whether people who were registered disabled might be exempt. That seemed to be partly the thrust of her remarks, but she did not refer to that group specifically. Although I agree with the broad thrust of the amendments, they are rather heavy-handed and would go too far. We should leave clause 1(1)(a) alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How would the Bill affect blind people? Of course, it is difficult, if not impossible, for a blind person to use a pooper-scooper. A person who was registered blind under the National Assistance Act 1948 could not see the mess that the dog had made. I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham brought up those subjects, but I cannot support the amendments that she tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to make my points with all due haste. I do not want to fall foul of you, Mr. Hill, by straying on to matters that are best left to a stand part debate. But some of the anxieties that have been discussed today are more relevant to the Wild Mammals (Protection) Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North on promoting the Bill. He was lucky to gain so high a place in the ballot. We have discussed one or two contentious items, but I support the Bill and I am sure that my constituents will also support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to speak in the debate. However, having heard the speech of the hon. Member for Burnley, I believe that some of his comments should not go unchallenged. A range of issues that are relevant to amendment No. 2 require attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is important, and I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North on promoting it. Nothing that I say should be taken as criticism of the fundamental purpose of the Bill, which I support. I want it to complete its passage, but only after it has been properly considered. That is why we are here. I resent some Opposition Members' remarks about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham said, there are 7 million dogs in this country.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0265">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
They are owned by 5.5 million people. Therefore, approximately 10 per cent. of the population are dog owners. The Bill will be important to them. If we do not get it right, several dog owners may face unwarranted prosecution, and illness and disease may be spread unnecessarily. We should not simply brush the Bill aside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key issue is the definition of reasonableness in clause 1(1)(a). That test determines whether amendment No. 2 is required. If we could assume that the items in amendment No. 2 were covered by clause 1(1)(a), the amendment would be unnecessary. Equally, objections to the use of dogs in sport would be unnecessary. If the hon. Member for Burnley argues that amendment No. 2 is not required, his whole argument about the provision relating to dogs being used for sporting purposes seems fallacious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may help the Committee and it may help the hon. Gentleman to abbreviate his speech if I say quite clearly, again, that I shall vote against amendment No. 2 if it is pushed to a vote. To expedite matters and make progress, I no longer intend to push the manuscript amendment to a vote. I have made my point, and that stands, but I want to see progress made because I want the Bill to get through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman's comments about the Bill getting through, but I understood him to say that he intended to vote against amendment No. 2, which I shall support—we shall be on opposite sides on that issue—and, unless I am mistaken, that he then intended to move the manuscript amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman now indicates that he will not in any circumstances move the manuscript amendment. I am heartened by that, but there are still a number of questions that must be dealt with for the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want first to deal with the question of reasonableness in clause 1(1)(a). As I was saying before the intervention, if reasonableness can be construed sufficiently widely, there is no need for amendment No. 2. I am not, however, convinced that in all circumstances it would be construed sufficiently widely in the courts to ensure that no prosecutions would follow for any of the activities listed in the amendment. It would, therefore, be appropriate to incorporate the amendment in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The use of the word "reasonable" is always difficult as the test is invariably subjective, however keen the judiciary may be to avoid that. I wondered whether the Bill would have been better drafted with some explanation of the meaning of "reasonable", but the use of the ejusdem generis rule in the interpretation of such an addition to the Bill would, perhaps, confuse the issue even more, so I have come to the conclusion that amendment No. 2 is the best vehicle for making it absolutely clear that those specific activities are excluded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is a distinguished lawyer and speaks with great erudition on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
subject, but what does he say to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham—that the amendment's flaw lies not in what it includes, but in what it does not include? How, in particular, does he respond to the problem with dog wardens and members of the RSPCA going about their business?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was intending to come to those points later, but I shall deal with them now. The Bill is quite clear that the person who is liable to be fined is the person who has charge of the dog. A dog does not come under the control of a dog warden or an RSPCA official until that person actually takes custody of the dog.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow my hon. Friend's reasoning, but there is some difficulty with the timing. A dog that an RSPCA officer or dog warden was trying to catch might, in effect, have no owner and no one in charge of it, but the officer or warden would become in charge of it as soon as he put a restraining leash on it and thereafter, when he was taking it through a housing estate to a waiting van, for example, he would be responsible for it. To place a burden on an officer—he may have to get a highly aggressive, sick dog into the back of a van to take it straight to a vet—to go back and make sure that everything is cleaned up would be unreasonable in view of the officer's duty of responsibility to his task.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good point, but we must bear in mind that the purpose of the Bill is to ensure that dog faeces are cleared up. Whoever has custody of the dog should have that responsibility. To take the example given by the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham, it follows that a dog running wild in a council estate is not in the custody of the dog warden and anything that it did prior to his getting hold of it would not be the warden's responsibility. There is no reason why it should not become his responsibility from the moment when he takes control of the dog. He will know where the dog may have stopped as he takes it to the van and when it is safely inside, the warden can go back and clear up before he moves on. It is appropriate for the warden to undertake that task as he has the necessary equipment in the van.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What if it were a matter of speed and urgency, for medical reasons, that the dog was taken to undergo tests? Let us suppose that there was a suspicion that the dog was rabid. The person catching it would be under a duty of care to get the dog to medical facilities as fast as possible to enable samples to be taken. In such circumstances, it would be unreasonable to put a burden on the warden to rush back and clear up the mess.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely right, but such extreme cases would be covered by the words "reasonable excuse". The fundamental point is dealt with in clause 1(1)(a); it is only the grey areas that need defining. I cannot imagine that a court would consider it other than entirely reasonable for a dog warden to take action when public health, and possibly, the dog's health, could be at risk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentions grey area. Will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0266">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
he tell us what will happen when a young child is in charge of a dog? For example, an adult might allow a little child to take a dog on to the road, not least because of the family's confidence in the animal to look after the child. If an incident occurred and the child failed to clear up the mess, would it fall within the definition of "reasonable excuse" or would it be outside the scope of the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would not apply because of the age of criminal responsibility. A small child is unlikely to be prosecuted for that reason. When children reach the age when they can understand that, they should have a pooper-scooper—I agree with hon. Members who have said that that is an awful expression—and when they know how to use it, they will be liable for prosecution. The law has its own devices to ensure that small children will not be prosecuted. The child may be in charge of the dog, but an adult is in charge of the child. Presumably, the court would consider that the adult, vicariously, had indirect custody of the dog and could thus be prosecuted. I accept that there is a slight difficulty in interpretation of the point, but the principle is clear; the small child is unlikely to be prosecuted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that his main objective at the moment is to take the Bill to a second sitting to make things difficult for the Wild Mammals (Protection) Bill, sponsored by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no idea what objectives other Opposition Members may have. Mine is to ensure that the Bill is properly considered and that we do our duty. I object strongly to the suggestion that hon. Members are not doing their jobs properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sykes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not said a word in the Committee, except to raise a small point of order at the beginning. Opposition Members have spoken ad nauseam.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Thomason) to move on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish will forgive me for this, but I am sure that my hon. Friend will agree that the hon. Gentleman was absent from the Committee for some time. During my speech I dealt with his point and made it clear where I agreed with him and also made it clear that one could hardly expect the Committee to be packed full of members of the British Field Sports Society, although some of us were born in the countryside and know something about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very interesting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is entirely right. I remember my hon. Friend referring several times to the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other key issue is the reference to land being designated by a local authority under clause 1(2). The debate appears to have assumed that local authorities will
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
designate only limited areas. That is not what the Bill says local authorities need to do. Local authorities will be able to designate any land that meets the criteria of being open to the public. National parks and traditional open spaces will be capable of designation. Local authorities may consider it inappropriate to designate such areas, but, even as a great supporter of local authorities, I know that, from time to time, they take views of their own, which they are entitled to do, to reflect the views of their communities. We cannot restrict them; nor can we be certain of what they will consider appropriate for designation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I first thought that councils would designate urban parks, grass verges, footpaths and so forth. It is apparent from the debate that that definition is far too narrow. For that reason, the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North are wholly necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I come to the amendments, I make the general point that we can assume that much of the enforcement will be undertaken by wardens employed by local authorities. The police may be involved from time to time, and citizen's arrest might also apply, but we can assume that dog wardens are the most interested parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Burnley has been kind enough to refer to my local government experience. I was leader of a local authority that introduced a dog warden scheme. As leader, I was not voted out, unlike the predecessor of the hon. Member for Burnley, because the majority of the Bournemouth population supported the introduction of a dog warden and Bournemouth pioneered the service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The overwhelming majority of people in Burnley also supported the action taken by the borough council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see; it was a case of the Labour group not being in touch with the people of Burnley and voting out its leader. I realise that you would rule me out of order, Mr. Hill, if I progressed down that path so I shall not do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Bournemouth, where there is a high proportion of tourists, there was a considerable conflict between the dog owner and what the dog did and the enjoyment of beaches, promenades and other areas. That must have been one of the motivations in the mind of my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North when he introduced the Bill. There is a need in such areas in particular to deal with those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if dog wardens are to be the key people involved in enforcement, as I believe they will be, clarity is needed. The point that is germane to the one that the hon. Member for Burnley made and which I have reiterated in relation to my own local authority experience is that we need to take people with us. The good will of the citizens is needed when undertaking any action of this sort. It is important that the dog warden is not seen to be a person of authority who seeks to use his powers unreasonably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill, therefore, needs to make it clear when it is appropriate for the dog warden to intervene and when he or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0267">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
she should take action. The proposals set out in amendment No. 2 will properly address those areas and avoid potential conflicts which could undermine the popularity of the Bill and the work of the dog warden generally. I particularly welcome the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been said and doubtless the Committee will be relieved to learn that I do not intend to repeat the points that have been made about the individual amendments, except to pick up one or two key issues. I remain concerned about the reference to "sporting purposes". No case has been made to show that the phrase is limited to fox hunting and shooting. I am interested to learn that the hon. Member for Burnley appears also to oppose shooting; others may wish to note that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to refer briefly to the discussion of vermin. The manuscript amendment would not address that issue and is, therefore, defective. I wondered why the proposed section (4)(b)(iii) referred to the tending of only cattle or sheep because there are other animals that farmers are diversifying into, some of which may need to be herded by dogs. [Hon. Members: "Llamas?"] I am not sure whether llamas, deer or even ostriches respond to herding by dogs, but that must be a consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has touched on an interesting point. There is a growing tendency for people to own strange pets. The Committee will note that if someone owned a llama that fouled the pavement, it would not be covered by the Bill. That is a worrying loophole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we have to deal with dogs. Doubtless my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East will introduce a separate Bill relating to llamas if he thinks it necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed subsection (4)(b)(v) refers to emergency rescue work which has been passed over very quickly in the course of the debate. It is important that the work of the emergency rescue service should be acknowledged.

It would be nonsense for the Bill to apply in those circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
