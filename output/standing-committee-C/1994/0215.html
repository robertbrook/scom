new clause 4 in the name of the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Simpson). I have selected those amendments in addition to those already standing in the name of the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock).</p>
	<p>After the Questions on clause 2 stand part and clause 3 stand part have been disposed of, I shall call the Minister to move formally new clause 1. If it is agreed that the clause be read a Second time, I shall call the hon. Members for Nottingham, South and for Christchurch in turn formally to move each of their amendments, if they wish to do so. When we have disposed of the Questions on any of those amendments which are moved, I will put the Question that the clause, as amended or not, as the case may be, be added to the Bill. I hope that that is clear.</p>
	<p>Therefore, I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following: New clause 1—	<i>Energy conservation reports</i>—
	<ol>
	<li>".—(1) It shall be the duty of every energy conservation authority to prepare a report in accordance with this section.</li>
	<ol>
	<li>The report shall set out energy conservation measures that the authority considers practicable, cost-efficient and likely to result in significant improvement in the energy efficiency of residential accommodation in its area.</li>
	<li>The report shall include—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>an assessment of the cost of the energy conservation measures set out in it,</li>
	<li>an assessment of the extent to which carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere would be decreased as a result of those measures, and</li>
	<li>a statement of the authority's policy for taking into account, in deciding whether to exercise any power to make a grant or loan to any person in connection with those measures, the personal circumstances of that person.
<br><br><!-- lb --> Nothing in this subsection shall be taken as requiring the authority to set out in the report energy conservation measures to be taken in relation to any particular dwelling or building.</li></ol>
	<li>The report may, if the energy conservation authority considers it desirable, include—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>an assessment of the extent of decreases in emissions into the atmosphere of oxides of nitrogen and sulphur dioxide which would result from the implementation of the measures set out in the report;</li>
	<li>an assessment of the number of jobs which would result from the implementation of those measures;</li>
	<li>an assessment of the average savings in fuel bills and in kilowatt hours or fuel used that might be expected to result from the measures by different types of household in different types of accommodation;</li>
	<li>such other matters as it considers appropriate.</li></ol>
	<li>An energy conservation authority may in preparing the report consult such persons as it considers appropriate.</li>
	<li>When an energy conservation authority has prepared a report in accordance with this section, it shall publish it and send a copy to the Secretary of State.".</li></ol></ol>
	<br><blockquote><p>"are needed to achieve overall energy savings of 25 per cent, against current consumption for the heating and lighting of residential accommodation in its area.".</p></blockquote></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"and giving priority to, the personal circumstances of any person or groups of persons in deciding to exercise any powers under this Act, or to make any grant or loan in connection with these measures.".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>(d), in line 30, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(7) In this section and in section (	<i>Modification of report and further reports</i>) the following terms shall have the following meanings, that is to say—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'Standard Assessment Procedure' has the same meaning as in the Building Regulations 1994, and the expression 'SAP Rating' shall be construed accordingly;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'public ownership' means residential accommodation owned by—
	<ol>
	<li>the energy conservation authority; or</li>
	<li>a housing association registered pursuant to the Housing Associations Act 1985; or</li>

	<p>New clause 4—	<i>Modification of report and further reports</i>—

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Robert B. Jones)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always, Sir John, the Committee is grateful for the clarification with which you have provided us. I am sure that it was through your influence that we have moved to what I have always thought of as my favourite Committee Room along this Corridor. It is a very nice Room but I have noticed, as, no doubt, have other members of the Committee, that we are over-warm. The Palace is once again letting down the public estate in its reputation for energy efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of our previous sitting, I was concluding a speech on targets. I do not think that there was a great difference of opinion across the Committee about the importance of targets, but we were debating the merits of having those targets in the Bill, or in guidance—the off-the-peg or tailor-made approach. I believe that the method that I was advocating commanded the support of local authorities. Rather than make a lengthy speech on those points this morning, I want to sum up what I was saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, to keep the 30 per cent. target in the Bill, would entail tabling subsequent amendments to detail the methodology of the calculations for the base line and for the 30 per cent. calculation from that base line. As we are a litigious society, it is better if that methodology is in guidance rather than in the Bill so that it is less complicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence shows that to have the targets in the guidance will allow flexibility where local authorities have a good record and where they have a bad record. It will also allow the targets to be kept up to date with international commitments, which change from time to time. We are about to have what I call son of Rio, but which I think is called the Berlin conference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Joan Ruddock 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, Deptford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Daughter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall de-sex the remark and say child of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
That method would allow other ways of measuring the targets, whether it be through standard assessment procedure ratings, as we discussed briefly at the previous sitting, or on the basis of carbon emissions or energy bills. All of those arguments point to having flexibility and a strong commitment if we deal with targets by means of guidance from the Secretary of State rather than by including them in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Diana Maddock 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir John, for helping us with the complicated procedure. The Government have re-ordered and re-written things, so your guidance is greatly appreciated. We always knew that targets would be one of the main topics in the Bill and that it would create the most problems for those of us who want the Bill to contain targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we said last week, for many of us targets are an important part of the Bill. The Government have targets for their own Departments. When they outline policy, they set targets for matters such as the punctuality of trains and health sevice waiting lists. That is one reason for the strong support for the inclusion of targets in the Bill. Despite what we have heard today, many councils and organisations that support the Bill think that a target is essential to ensure that the Bill has a significant effect. Environmental organisations feel especially strongly about that, as does Age Concern. Sally Greengross of Age Concern has written to all members of the Committee to make clear that organisation's strongly held views. I have been left in no doubt by many of the Bill's supporters as to the strength of feeling on the issue of targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said during our previous sitting, the amendment is a compromise. It sets a 25 per cent. target for local authorities. Even that concession was not popular with members of the Committee. The hon. Member for Nottingham, South was not at all happy about that. After a week, I am more than disappointed that the Government are not prepared to accept the compromise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am deeply concerned about how "significant" targets will be interpreted by the Government and energy conservation authorities. However, I would consider not moving the amendment on the condition that the Minister gives me a concrete assurance that the guidance notes from his Department, which will be produced for local authorities, will set a target percentage for energy savings and that, for the majority of councils, that target will be 30 per cent. or more. We shall have further discussions on how we can deal with targets. I shall not come to a final conclusion until I have heard the hon. Member for Nottingham, South on other ways of achieving targets that may be more acceptable to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there are few local authorities whose energy conservation efforts earn them the right to be considered as exceptions to the general rule. That issue
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0320">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
was raised last week and, again, by local authority associations in the past few days. I have listened to them and, to some extent, I accept their views. However, it is worth remembering that Newark and Sherwood council, which has one of the best records on energy conservation of any council, thinks that it could achieve further energy savings of 50 per cent. in its area. Other trail-blazing councils also believe that they could achieve savings of 30 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a concession, I was prepared to accept a target of 25 per cent. However, if we are to rely on guidance to set a target for local authorities, it should set a target of 30 per cent. I hope that the Minister will give me that assurance. If that happens, I shall have made a big concession. It is difficult for me to accept and I have received much criticism about it. Therefore, it is important that the Minister gives a genuine assurance that the guidance will set a target and that he will use all his powers to ensure that that target is enforced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has a good record on this issue. It is precisely because he has that record that I may be minded not to move the amendment. He is a strong supporter of energy conservation and has been constructive in his approach so far. I know that he is as keen as I am that the Bill should be passed and should play an effective part in the Government's energy conservation strategy—the need for which is the reason for the Bill. Depending on the inclusion of measures in the guidance, the giving of assurances by the Minister and the eventual outcome, in future years organisations may be concerned about the omission of the target from the text of the Bill and may study closely the way the guidance notes are dealt with by the Minister and future Ministers. The guidance will need to be strong and firmly enforced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment (b) seeks to help the fuel poor and is very simple. The Minister's new clause refers to a local authority's policy for taking into account people's personal circumstances when making grants and loans. I do not disagree with that. It should be part of local authority policy, but I see no reason for not emphasising in the Bill the need to target education and promotion as well as prioritising financial assistance. To the best of my knowledge the Government do not disagree with me, but rather dislike certain wording. I do not think that other Committee members would disagree that we need to use every means of prioritising the interests of the elderly and other people who are fuel poor. I hope that the Minister will explain exactly what he will do about the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Temple-Morris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leominster)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to be called to speak now and I am sorry that I did not say my few words at the previous sitting. For various reasons I had to leave early and therefore perhaps did not pay sufficient attention to what was said. Certainly I could not intervene. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary was kind enough to have a word with me that night and explain what was happening. For better or worse he excited my interest and, having read the speeches that were made last week, which, hon. Members will be delighted to know, read rather well, I have leapt to my feet this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Christchurch has dealt with matters very fairly. Since I read the wise words of my hon. Friend the Minister and other hon. Members I have been cranking myself up to support her, but now I find
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
that she has made a very reasonable concession, which encapsulates my conclusions that both flexibility and a target area can be maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle of targets has been well rehearsed, from the Rio summit, to the Germans, to Government heating—perhaps even with regard to this Room—and the hon. Member for Christchurch made her points very well. A fundamental point about the plan is that it is only that. The local authority's duty will be to provide plans, but the power, as ever, will reside as it should with my hon. Friend the Minister and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a power of the Secretary of State to order a timetable for implementation, which could be as specific as necessary. Therefore, the question of starting from a different base can be taken into consideration with or without reference to a percentage figure. It is important, therefore, in aiming for flexibility to opt for a percentage figure too. The word "significant" can cover a multitude of sins. Our efforts are focused upon areas of very little action with the aim of producing a little more action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my hon. Friend the Minister stayed in his present role for ever more, we would not need to set a percentage. Despite that, I hope and wish for my hon. Friend's imminent promotion to whatever area of Her Majesty's Government he may want to occupy. By the laws of reason, chance and election, my hon. Friend will not remain in his present post for ever. Therefore, we have to cater for what future Governments might do. I would feel much more secure if we set a percentage figure. In addition, the Secretary of State should have the flexibility to implement such targets accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should go for both a target and flexibility. We can reach a compromise by doing what the hon. Member for Christchurch suggested and writing a figure into the guidance. However, as we all know there is guidance and guidance. My hon. Friend the Minister has been strong on the guidance point. If he can provide a little more in the way of assurance, the amendment may not be moved. I still have an open mind, so I shall listen with interest to my hon. Friend's final words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the hon. Member for Christchurch. If she comes to a compromise with the Government and that is criticised, I shall stand beside her to defend her decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of putting a rigid target into the Bill is that that does not allow the possibility of further improvements when the initial target of 30 per cent. has been reached. Both sides of the Committee agree that 30 per cent. is a pretty limited target. Many home owners and housing authorities believe that they can reach that target relatively easily by, for example, changing the boiler or installing the right level of insulation. Much more than the target can be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we decide to place a target in the guidance, we shall not only have the benefit of a target of 30 per cent. rather than that of 25 per cent., which might be in the Bill, but we shall allow present or future Ministers to aim for further improvements. Setting targets is important. Road casualty reduction targets were not written into legislation but they were firmly declared, followed and exceeded.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0321">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
Higher targets could then be set for further improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal of the hon. Member for Christchurch would carry the support of the Committee. It should also convince interested bodies outside the House. There has been a sign of co-operation from my hon. Friend the Minister who has been able to feel his way towards going further than appeared possible last week. I join in the tributes being paid to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gary Waller 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Keighley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the reasonable and sensible approach that the hon. Member for Christchurch has adopted. Like other members of the Committee, she will want to take careful account of the views of local authorities, which will be responsible for ensuring that targets are achieved and the Bill's aims are met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have considered the briefing produced jointly by the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, the Association of District Councils and the Association of County Councils. Their views carry great weight. The briefing makes it clear that those associations have no objections to targets. However, it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The use of statutory targets in the Home Energy Conservation Bill is fraught with difficulty. It is a unique piece of legislation dealing with the complex issue of energy efficiency and is an area which does not lend itself easily to meaningful targets. In addition, the associations are unable to find another example where primary legislation is the preferred method of specifying a local authority target."</p></blockquote>
There are good reasons why that has been the case. Setting specific targets in a Bill, as I said in our previous sitting, is a rigid way of proceeding. It does not allow for amendment. In particular, the present proposal does not allow for the historical achievements of some local authorities. It is not surprising that the local authority association document continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The setting of a target … is … misplaced unless it takes full account of the historical performance of the local authority."</p></blockquote>
Later, the document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The associations believe that an inflexible target in legislation will serve as an end in itself and not the means to achieve greater energy efficiency. It will effectively penalise good performing authorities and could become an unnecessary focus that will burden, rather than assist, local authorities in their endeavour."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, it is important that we should accept the need to be flexible and that, although the setting out of targets in the Bill may appear to be a great step forward, it may not assist the process that we want to set under way. I have come to believe that a more significant measure of achievement would be to set out not a target of 30 per cent. or 25 per cent. but the potential achievement, bearing in mind what local authorities had done in the past. I should expect the Government to set rolling targets that were achievable but reasonable and which could be altered from time to time. They could be based on an overall level of energy saving, rather than on what local authorities have been able to do until now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly agree with the views of the local authority associations. Hon. Members will probably see the sense of what has been suggested, and I hope that it will be possible to reach a consensus in Committee that will enable the Bill to be passed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Simpson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of the importance of the comments that were made today by
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
the hon. Member for Keighley (Mr. Waller), and I see the difficulties that arise from the inclusion of relative standards in the Bill. One need not go too deeply into the argument to understand the worries of local authorities that have already achieved a great deal in energy conservation that they would be asked to do most with respect to the cost effectiveness of insulation and that authorities that had done the least would be set relatively low standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was in the light of these facts that I was moved to table the amendments in my name, which would effect a transition from relative targets to absolute standards. I am aware that that approach is consistent with much of the thinking at the Department of the Environment and with the standards set by the Department for new-build properties since 1992—a proper and laudable course of action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment would extend that logic into the approach to home energy insulation in the Bill. I am attempting to approach the matter using terms with which I feel slightly uncomfortable in that they are represented by the acronym, SAPs. That is probably one of the worst acronyms that I have had to deal with. I have explained it to people by pointing out that they can understand tog ratings for duvets and sleeping bags and that all we are talking about is a tog rating for housing. I wish that someone would come up with a better acronym than SAP, but that is what we have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would set a standard of a SAP rating of 60 and would then set target dates by which the average SAP rating for publicly-owned properties should be met by local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall explore some of the points that I have tried to cover in the amendment. My first aim was to understand the misgivings of a number of Members who referred last week to their fears about the thermal police. I want to try to draw a distinction between the obligations that we should place upon local authorities to meet the targets and the requirement for them to use their best endeavours to encourage the meeting of those targets in properties outside their control and ownership. The obligation would fall on local authorities in relation to their properties. Beyond that, it would be a best endeavours approach to encourage raising the energy efficiency of the existing housing stock, which would be in the public's interest. The aim of that provision is specifically to avoid falling into the trap of being accused of setting up a regime of thermal policing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would recognise the achievements of authorities that had done the most in meeting those standards and present them with the least difficulties in reaching and exceeding the standard targets. The purpose of the amendment is also to try to set reasonably accessible statements in the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also, the amendment would give the Secretary of State power, without having to introduce primary legislation at a subsequent stage, to set different standards which he or she felt were appropriate in terms of Government policy, the needs of the country and our international environmental obligations. That would empower the Minister, but not oblige him, to come back with a subsequent timetable in 2005.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals need to be set into the context of what a SAP rating would actually mean. The examples that have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0322">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>51</span>
already been cited of authorities that have done work related to energy efficiency in the home give us the best examples of our present position and how difficult or easy it might be to meet the standards that are proposed in the amendment. Newark and Sherwood has been mentioned, and I do not apologise for that. I praise it for compelling us to cite it so frequently. It undertook an assessment of the energy efficiency in its homes in 1985. It found that the average SAP rating in council properties was a mere 23. In five years, it raised the average standard to 46. That is the current standard which applies to all of Newark and Sherwood's council-owned properties. It estimates that, by prudent and gradual steps, it can raise that average to a SAP rating of 78 by 2009. That rating is well in excess of the figure in the amendment. Newark and Sherwood would meet that by a comfortable margin by 2009.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Manchester assessed its current housing stock and found that the current average for public and private sector stock is 34. I shall return to the significance of that figure shortly. However, it is worth pointing out that greater disparities will often be found in the private sector. It is much easier for authorities in the public sector to meet a SAP rating at 60 given the disparate proportions of public and private sector stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Northern Ireland Housing Executive found that the current average SAP for its housing stock is 35. It conducted its own estimates of achievable targets and concluded that investment in cavity wall insulation could raise the figure by 10 units. By topping up loft insulation to the standard of 6 in that has been set for new buildings and by a combination of draught-proofing and heating improvements, it could add a further 10 to 15 units to the rating. That would bring the executive comfortably to the figure of 60 units.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is evidence that the best authorities can comfortably meet the target through a steady programme of upgrading properties. It is not a pie-in-the-sky standard. It is within the defined limits of what local authorities think they can sensibly achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A countrywide analysis shows that 14 million properties could benefit from such a programme. The standard in the amendment would involve 3 million properties. It covers public sector stock which is directly the responsibility of local authorities. Of those properties, 1 million would benefit from cavity wall insulation and almost 2 million from raising loft insulation and draught-proofing standards. Obligations would be placed on those 3 million properties, but the other 11 million properties would have to be covered by other Government initiatives to encourage owners of private and rented properties to become part of a general programme to upgrade home insulation standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is achievable in the view of local authorities. I know that some authorities of all political persuasions would achieve the standards with no difficulty at all. In fact, some have already met them. We should hand out bouquets to those authorities entitled to receive them. However, the Committee has to consider those authorities that have done the least. Those authorities should study the authorities that are meeting the standards and use them as working models of how to deliver the acceptable standards that the Committee wants to see in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
Are the standards unrealistic internationally? The answer is no. Two studies have compared the standard of housing insulation in this country with that of some of our European neighbours. The first study was a National Audit Office report carried out in 1992. It compared with the standards of home insulation in Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. It concluded that
	<br><blockquote><p>"even allowing for climate differences, an average house in Sweden used less than one third the energy of an average house in Sheffield, and an average Danish house used less than half the energy. The UK came bottom of this league of four."</p></blockquote>
All we are trying to do is to set standards for this country that many of our European partners began to set themselves as far back as the end of the last war.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many hon. Members of all parties and many members of the public would no doubt welcome standards set in such a way as to avoid fears about discriminatory processes based on relative percentage targets. They would welcome instead an approach consistent with Department of Environment policy for new buildings, which I suspect is its preferred policy for all United Kingdom buildings. That could only benefit the bulk of the population.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Minister's reiteration of his acceptance of targets as a sensible approach. I recognise that the inclusion of an overall target figure in the Bill imposes a rigidity that might not prove helpful in the long term. To take the route of issuing guidance, therefore, seems a sensible preference and would offer greater flexibility than the method of fixing something finally in primary legislation, because it offers the chance to update figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister, will be in office almost in perpetuity—I disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Leominster (Mr. Temple-Morris), who seemed to expect his tenure to be fairly short. I am sure that my hon. Friends, and perhaps other hon. Members, hope that it will last at least a couple of decades. During that time we will all be able to monitor progress towards the targets. Many changes will occur, including improvements in technology, which will make our aims of today—even of 30 per cent.—appear very modest when my hon. Friend makes his valedictory speech to the House in 2015.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise with the hon. Member for Christchurch in her wish to return to the target figure of 30 per cent. if the guidance mechanism is adopted. I also congratulate her on her decision not to move her amendment, which was a sensible contribution to the likely success of the Bill. I hope that it will ensure its safe passage onto the statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might help the Committee in its deliberations on amendment (b) if the Minister could say something about the increase in expenditure under the home energy efficiency scheme, which seems to be directly relevant. My recollection is that expenditure has increased substantially under the scheme. When my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State was Chairman of the Select Committee on the Environment, it recommended that the client contribution to the scheme should be abolished. The Government were able to accept that recommendation. The more we can publicise that scheme and its success, the more we can reassure people that anyone who is in

The hon. Member for Nottingham, South was right to draw attention, through his amendments, to the importance of SAP ratings. I welcome anything that we can do, even in a debate such as this, to publicise the existence of such ratings, which are not as widely known as we should like. My hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley), who has disappeared for a moment, referred to the remarkable progress that was made on a number of road safety issues by the use of targets and, above all—he would say—by changing the climate of opinion, especially on drink-driving. Those were not great legislative changes—they simply made the public more concerned about the problem of drinking and driving. We have a similar task ahead of us in terms of energy conservation. We need a change in attitudes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since the hon. Gentleman has used that analogy, will he explain how we would have made any progress on drink-driving if we had not specified the number of milligrams of alcohol per litre of blood? What would be the sanction?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be drawn too far on that subject, but I would say that everyone in the Committee, and certainly my hon. Friend the Minister, has accepted the importance of setting targets. There is no dispute between us on mat. My belief—I am sure that it is shared by my hon. Friend the Minister, who may say this himself, if he speaks before the debate is concluded—is that the decisive factor in cutting the number of deaths from drink-driving was a climate of public disapproval of offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to think that we could achieve the same sea change in public attitudes towards energy conservation, so that people who were contemplating buying, renting or investing in a residential home would ask "What is the energy rating?", even before they asked what council tax band the home was in or, in the case of a flat, what the service charges were. They would be aware that the energy rating was as important a factor in the running costs of a home as those other considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we could achieve that change in public attitudes, all sorts of desirable energy conservation measures would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
flow quite naturally and would be adopted voluntarily by owners, house-buyers when they first moved in, and landlords and tenants. It is an opportunity to harness people's self-interest, quite apart from the environmental benefits that would flow from the measures. Anyone approaching investment in, or ownership of, residential property on a rational basis should concern themselves with energy efficiency and conservation almost before anything else. The potential consequence of that change in attitudes would be enormous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was depressed by the fact that so much of the public debate about, and media attention on the Government's other big energy conservation proposal last year—to increase the rate of VAT on domestic fuel to 17.5 per cent.—was at the level of how many old people would freeze during the winter, wholly disregarding the fact that such people would be entirely protected against the increased costs. Most importantly, that diverted attention away from the energy conservation measures that can be taken, in many cases, at low cost. The potential for doing that was rightly referred to by the hon. Member for Nottingham, South.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aims of the hon. Gentleman's amendments are entirely sensible and they would simply extend the target-based approach on a more specific basis. Given that the substantial majority of residential property is in private ownership, it is paragraph (b) of his amendment that is crucial. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister, in his reply, will be able to say a bit about how he is trying to persuade private homeowners what he can do—and what we can all do, as Members of Parliament—to change the climate of opinion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also received a letter from Rushmore Homes, which is currently building in my constituency. We must pay due regard to new build. We are discussing long-term plans, because we must deal with our existing housing stock. It is important, however, not to ignore the potential for new houses as so many are being built each year.

The hon. Member for Nottingham, South mentioned SAP measurements. I did not have the faintest idea what they were before I became involved in the Bill. In American terminology, a sap is something else completely. More attention and publicity should be given to standard assessment procedures. When people buy cars, they take account of energy and fuel efficiency. They know generally how many miles to the gallon certain cars do and can judge whether a certain car is right for them by how much it will cost them in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely the same should apply to houses. When people consider what is the most expensive item that they are likely to buy, they should know about the running costs that will be incurred after the initial capital cost. People should know about the standard assessment procedure and how much it will cost them to run their homes. The measurements for new build should be extended to all houses. When people look at houses to see whether they like them or not, one of the most important factors that the estate agent should tell them is the rating for energy efficiency. In that way, more regard will be paid to energy conservation in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was shown around the development in Shipping, I was impressed by the attention that was paid to detail and the amount of publicity that was given to energy conservation. Even the board outside the development stressed energy conservation. I hope that far more publicity will be given to energy ratings, so that when people buy houses there will be an established rating in which everyone has confidence. Judgments could then be made about house purchases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Robathan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blaby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also said last week how important it was that the Bill did not become meaningless flannel. I remain of that mind. I have listened with great interest to what has been said this morning. My hon. Friend the Minister sent me a detailed and sensible letter which set out his position. He stated the same view today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we do not produce a Bill that will be regarded as foolish in retrospect and will create more problems than it will solve. There is no doubt that we all support its aim, as my hon. Friend has said many times, both in his current position and previously, when he was perhaps more free to speak his mind. We must not create a paradise for litigious pressure groups or lawyers, and produce something that will be useful to people who live in properties and not useful to the courts alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I generally agree with my hon. Friend, but the test will be the guidance that is given. I accept his good faith, but I do not want the Bill's provisions to become wishy-washy or flannel. I look forward to hearing the hon. Member for Christchurch. The Minister has been sensible and has proposed sensible measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have read with interest the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Nottingham, South. I have no problem with the term "SAP". I do not use it in a derogatory sense. We have spring weather today and the sap is rising, just as the hon. Gentleman wants the SAP of our housing stock to rise. However, I have misgivings about the time scale of the amendments. I shall be interested to hear my hon. Friend the Minister's views on that. I also have misgivings about the provision for historic buildings. The amendment may not be applicable to some historic residential buildings, which are often warmer than
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
modern housing stock. They are the responsibility of Government Departments. Again, I shall be interested to hear my hon. Friend the Minister's views on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) referred to building regulations and new housing stock. They are important issues and we should consider them once this Bill is out of the way. Recent building regulations have improved the SAP rating for new buildings, but we can do better than that. It is not a matter of pride that our housing stock uses three times the amount of energy that Sweden's does. It is colder in Sweden, so it should be easier for Britain's housing stock to use less energy. We should tackle that problem. It is not just a question of roof and wall insulation. We should consider design and whether it is desirable to have detached houses when the terraces of old, such as the Nash terraces, are much more energy efficient. They use party walls that do not require as much heating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to ensure that the Bill is not made weaker even though it may include a compromise. We continue to support the principles behind it, as does the Association of District Councils. We want flexible and pragmatic legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise not to make a speech, but to press the Minister on a few matters. So much apparent sweetness and light has broken out in the Committee that I feel that we are wading through treacle. If it had not been for the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South, we would have lost sight of targets altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read carefully the Minister's speeches from our previous sitting, which he has added to today. However, he still has not given me a clear sign of where he will put solid targets. His case is that targets should appear not in the Bill, but in guidance. The Minister must tell us clearly what the guidance will contain. Otherwise, we shall have great difficulty in deciding whether the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Christchurch should be put to a vote. It is essential to have that information before we conclude that we are willing to lose sight of the target of 30 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister proposed using SAPs so that
	<br><blockquote><p>"authorities do not worry about the starting point but about where they need to get to."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee C,</i> 8 February 1995; 	<i>c.</i> 36.]</p></blockquote>
Is that the Minister's definition of "significant" or does "significant" mean something else? He did not define precisely that word. How does he expect the individual targets, which we now understand he will place in the guidance, to add up? The Minister said also that there was 30 per cent. to be saved. Will those individual targets, set in whatever form he intends to set them, result in a reduction of at least 30 per cent.? He must tell us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we know, SAPs relate to local authority housing. We know also that, regrettably, 30 or more Tory housing authorities have entirely divested themselves of council housing. We need to know what standard targets would apply in specific cases where the authority is not working to a comparison between the public and private sectors, and how the Minister will set overall targets for the private sector which, as hon. Members have said, accounts for the majority of the housing stock in most areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0325">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
We supported the 30 per cent. target, believing, as does the hon. Member for Christchurch, that we must know what we are aiming for. Although the Minister made much of not knowing where we started from, I think that, wherever we started from, a 30 per cent. reduction is a worthwhile target. The Minister must show us how he intends to achieve at least as much as that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our aim—I am sure that it applies to the Committee as a whole—must be to secure warmer homes and to reduce fuel bills and CO	<div class='sup'>2</div> <!-- sup --> emissions. At Rio. the Government accepted a specific target for CO	<div class='sup'>2</div> <!-- sup --> emissions: the stabilisation of CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions at 1990 levels by 2000. In arguing for VAT on fuel, which I still contend means colder homes for some, Ministers spoke of the Rio commitment. I ask the Minister to tell us what were the energy reductions anticipated by the imposition of the second tranche of VAT on fuel? Will the measures in the Bill, targeted in the way that the Minister will propose to us, equal those theoretical reductions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all want the Bill to be a success, but it will be a success only if the Minister, in proposing that there should be no targets in the Bill and that they should be contained in guidance, can convince us of the form that that guidance will take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the amendment in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South because it gives a clear indication of realistic targets. Those targets are ones which the Minister himself suggested and, in terms of SAPS, would be an appropriate way in which to move forward. I conclude my remarks, but I suspect that I may wish to intervene on the Minister, as has been my wont.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert B. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall have to wait and see whether the hon. Lady's expectations are fulfilled. We have had a long and interesting debate, and many points have been raised. I have to say—perhaps this comes from the perspective of a former member and Chairman of a Select Committee who never had a disagreement on that Committee—that consensus is a good thing. I suppose that that is why the former hon. Member for Bootle, Mr. Allan Roberts, once described me in the Select Committee as a closet liberal. I reject that term, but I think that it was related to my desire to seek consensus wherever possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady referred to the Government's energy conservation strategy, but I regard that as the country's energy conservation strategy because there is no doubt that individuals play a large part in this matter. They are complacent, as the hon. Member for Nottingham, South pointed out. Any strategy must motivate them, not simply officials in local and national Government.

My hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) asked about the home energy efficiency scheme. I am happy to confirm that it is a large scheme. Resources for the next financial year will be more than £100 million, a 45 per cent. increase on the current year. That should help 600,000 households. I had the privilege of being in Newcastle on Monday for the millionth beneficiary of the scheme to be processed. By coincidence, it was an excellent lady, Mrs. Jean Sanderson, from my constituency of Hertfordshire, West. I cannot say that I am sorry that it was a constituent of mine, but I would have been just as pleased if it had been a constituent of the hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Ms Ruddock). I shall,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
of course, look into the reasons for the delay in the case that the hon. Lady described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should have made it possible for my constituent to be the beneficiary. I wrote to him in mid-December. I explained that the applicant was an elderly constituent with a sick husband and that she qualified for help. The Minister replied that he was sorry about my constituent's disappointment, but he acknowledged that it was a cash-limited scheme and that only a few grants could be paid out. By mid-December last year, there was no money left for my constituent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not strictly true. I confirm that the scheme was cash-limited, but we have shaken a few people upside down and watched the pennies fall out of their pockets. We have managed to find an additional £8.86 million to help the waiting lists. As I promised, I shall look into the case of the hon. Lady's constituent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for Suffolk, South, for Ribble Valley and for Blaby (Mr. Robathan) raised the question of the private sector. They asked me to share my thinking with the Committee. The private sector is the key sector because it is the biggest. Part of the answer lies in the process of education. Many people can afford to carry out energy conservation measures in their own homes, but they do not do so. Our current £6 million campaign of education is aimed at turning awareness of the link between energy use and environmental damage into practical action. We shall assess that in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the private sector, the point where the rubber meets the road is when a house changes hands. My hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley said that energy efficiency should be as well used a concept as miles per gallon is when people buy a car. I am pleased that some building societies, especially the Nationwide and Halifax building societies, have included energy ratings in their surveys. I am talking to lenders—the banks and building societies—about ways of developing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a former Chairman of the Environment Select Committee and as a Minister, I have argued that it is in the interests of lenders to ensure that people buy energy-efficient homes. People who spend less on energy will find it easier to pay their mortgages. Such schemes are, therefore, in everyone's interests. I am encouraged by the enthusiasm of the Nationwide and Halifax building societies and the growing interest among other lenders. We shall try to move that forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Nottingham, South followed up my point about SAP ratings. He was right to do so. They provide an alternative to the historic picture, but I do not want him to think that SAP ratings do not have disadvantages. By writing them and timetables into the Bill, we return to the problems that the local authority associations raised earlier. On top of that, we have to think about the changing nature of SAP ratings—they measure particular approaches in the home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As new technology develops—a point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South—the SAP rating system will change. Not long ago, there was confusion in the marketplace about ratings—there was a plethora of them. One point made in the Select Committee report was that they should be brought together and that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0326">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>59</span>
the Government should encourage the use of one rating. Of course, that is the SAP rating which we are now using in building regulations for new homes and in our guidance to housing associations. We have a good track record on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the measure was written in its present form into the Bill, it would be much more difficult to adapt to changing technology and to other types of energy conservation as we move away from traditional ones such as roof insulation, tank lagging, sealants around doors and windows and cavity fill. Who knows whether heat exchanges, for example, will become the norm? The method of rating is evolving, not static.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a problem with the precision of measurement. The hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Jones) made a point about measuring the level of alcohol. That is precisely measurable. If it were not, it could not be used as evidence in a criminal prosecution. SAP ratings cannot be measured to that infinite degree. We are also trying to encourage local authorities to work on a block assessment system whereby they do not try to assess every home but use the information on architects' drawings, types of heating and so on to develop a picture. That method is not capable of setting measurements in tablets of stone, as stated in the amendment of the hon. Member for Nottingham, South.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to leave the hon. Gentleman with the impression that I am hostile to the concept. I raised the matter myself because it is a good way of approaching assessment. That and other methods should be included in guidance notes that we send out to local authorities. For many, it will be one of the best ways of approaching assessment, although I am not entirely clear whether it would be better to work towards average SAP ratings or raising the minimum SAP rating. The latter method has the advantage of concentrating effort on the coldest and least energy efficient homes. We shall want to discuss the matter with local authorities. We regard it as an evolving process, as national and international developments mean that we are able to save more energy over the years rather than simply freeze an energy conservation target.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The points raised by the hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford replicate the questions raised by the promoter of the Bill. I shall tackle one issue head on. She said, in relation to large-scale voluntary transfers, that it was regrettable that local authorities had divested themselves of their council housing. I do not accept that, nor, I think, does the Labour party. We have been carrying out studies with Labour authorities in Hull, Sheffield and Manchester to find out how LSVTs might benefit people in their area. Even if I were to accept what the hon. Lady said, it does not matter, in terms of targets, who owns the properties. We are discussing the whole stock of property, whether it is owned by a private landlord, a local authority, a housing association or an individual. Any targets will apply equally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Christchurch would be the first to jump to her feet in defence of her constituency and to point out that the Twynham housing association, which has received such a large-scale voluntary transfer, has been at the forefront of improving the energy efficiency of its stock and considers that to be a benefit of having an LSVT. The facts do not sustain the hon. Lady's argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
I do not view the question of targets in the way that it has been portrayed by either my hon. Friends or the hon. Member for Christchurch—as a compromise, a giveaway or whatever. I was not interested in reducing the target from 30 per cent. to 25 per cent. The point was how best to achieve the target. The debate concerned means, not ends. I think that 30 per cent. is perfectly achievable—a point that I have made before as Chairman of the Select Committee and as a Minister. We need a figure for which to aim in our guidance, and 30 per cent. is perfectly reasonable as an overall target.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would go beyond that—it is reasonable to say that all local authorities should aim for that figure and men wait for individual local authorities that consider that to be difficult or impossible to achieve to come to us to argue their case. As several hon. Members have said, the Newark and Sherwoods of this world have said that they are happy to take on that challenge. Others feel it would be difficult. I would want to listen to what they had to say—I sense that that would be the view of the Committee. As with all such matters, we are committed to consultation with local authorities about the content of any proposed guidance and the methodology that we would use. I see no problem with that, especially given the views of the local authority associations to which my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley referred earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In theory, this debate is entirely about targets, but targets and guidance go hand in hand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sense that the Minister is moving on. Could I just press him on the point that I raised in my opening remarks, which is whether he will use all the powers that he has to bring the matter home to local authorities. I think that you indicated that in what you said—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Lady, but I hope that she will use the correct form of address. I am not involved in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Sir John. I hope that the Minister will address the 30 per cent. target for the authorities. He has suggested that he will leave the target at 30 per cent. and then ensure that local authorities argue the point with him. I should like reassurance on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give that reassurance. I was about to say that we would want to include in the guidance the sort of progress that we would expect local authorities to make. Obviously, we shall consider that with the local authority associations, but that proposal is along the lines of the hon. Lady's aims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said back in November, or perhaps October, there is no distinction between my aims and those of the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) and now those of the hon. Lady. The disagreement was about the means of achieving them. I said in a letter to the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed that I thought that we could do better than the Bill by developing the flexibility that will enable us to take the matter forward and review the targets as and when circumstances arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What contribution would the Bill, if enacted, make to the Government's overall strategy? I must press the Minister on this important point, because it would solidify our feelings about his commitment if we could see that it was part of the Government's overall strategy and that a calculation had been made to meet the targets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt the hon. Lady knows that the use of energy in buildings is responsible for roughly half of greenhouse gas emissions, so she can do the calculations as well as I can. I cannot tell the immediate impact of the proposed legislation until we have a complete picture from local authorities about their own properties, apart from private sector stock. That picture will become clearer over time. I certainly view the matter as an important ingredient in the Government's overall environmental strategy—indeed, the nation's environmental strategy, as I do not believe that there is any difference between us about the importance of this issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have covered all the points that have been made, with one exception. I refer to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Christchurch about personal circumstances. As I said in our previous sitting, I cannot accept the hon. Lady's amendment, but I shall be happy to look at the relevant subsection carefully to ensure that any authority is required, as part of its report, to state how it takes account of personal circumstances when implementing or deciding to implement all energy conservation measures, and not just when making grants or loans. I do not think that there is a difference in substance, and I hope that it will be possible to work out a satisfactory wording to consider on for the Report stage. Therefore, I invite the hon. Lady to join me in changing the wording of the Bill. I hope that she will not press the amendment and will accept the logic of my suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simpson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should make it clear that it is important to move the amendment that I have tabled. Despite the wooing and reassuring words of the Minister, there are extremely important points of principle that need to be addressed. On Second Reading, many hon. Members referred to two main issues. The first was our international obligation under the Rio summit and the second was the number of unnecessary and avoidable winter deaths because of fuel poverty, which causes problems to many of our constituents. It is commonly accepted that 50,000 people die unnecessarily in the winter because of fuel poverty. It is because of that number and because people live in miserable, poorly heated properties that we must ensure that our decisions today are adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have to express my serious reservations about the gap between standards and guidance. Over the years, Governments have provided much guidance about the provision of decent housing. Some local authorities have accepted and acted in such guidance, whether it has come from Government or from external lobby groups. The Bill was presented because many authorities have disregarded
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
such advice. They have neither chosen to set standards for themselves nor been required to meet standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How our aims are achieved is a matter of process. I agree with the Minister that house-by-house assessments of energy efficiency ratings are not necessary. There are many more cost-effective ways to achieve our aims. The technological changes that are taking place will continue to make our aims more achievable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 10 days, I shall be on a plane that will undertake a thermal-imaging scan of all the properties within its flightpath in my constituency. On Second Reading, I stated my mixed feelings about the extent of the flightpath, which included Broxtowe—a Conservative-controlled authority. Broxtowe has taken up the option offered by Nottingham city council of joining the scan for £200. Sadly, the authority in Rushcliffe, the constituency of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, turned down the offer because it did not think that the scan was worth the money. I cannot countenance a more effective method, which can be reduced to a house-by-house analysis, of determining the energy efficiency of properties within the borough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert B. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can resolve one problem that has arisen; technical matters will be dealt with later in guidance. I would want to draw attention to practical techniques, such as those mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, and encourage local authorities to take advantage of them. Such techniques offer real prospects of obtaining data which can be properly focused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simpson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for those comments. I do not dispute what he says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I used the thermal-imaging scan as an example because it was produced by a partnership between local authorities and the private sector. It has involved local authorities of different political persuasions. A cheap offer to an adjoining local authority has not been accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider whether we are to produce a Bill that, although full of good intentions, is flannel and does not set specific standards. I use the word "standards", because several hon. Members thought that the word "targets" was open to unhelpful interpretations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Standards are not relative. They should set clear and consistent requirements such as those set by the Department of the Environment for new properties. We should seek to extend such standards to existing properties. Members of the Committee have praised the standards set for new properties, but those who live in abject fuel poverty and those who die unnecessarily in the winter because of such poverty do not live in the best-insulated new properties on the market. We must change the quality of life of people who live in poorly insulated properties and who are unlikely to move to the best insulated properties available. Unless we set standards that will apply to existing properties, we will have made virtually no progress on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for not being present earlier, Sir John—that is the problem with serving on two Committees at the same time. It is wrong for the hon.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>63</span>
Gentleman to say that, if what he wants does not happen, all our efforts will have been wasted. That would betray those of us who have promoted the Bill and taken a keen interest in the subject for years. The Bill will do an enormous amount, even if the standards that the hon. Gentleman wants are not written into it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simpson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue is not whether my standards are accepted, but whether any standards are applied. I was one of those who were reasonably happy to work on the figure of 30 per cent. that the hon. Member for Christchurch specified in the original draft. I understand hon. Members' reservations about those being relative, rather than absolute and measurable, standards. I am flexible on that. If hon. Members had argued that the standards were not high enough, I would have been happy to withdraw my amendment in favour of one that set higher standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The standards that my amendment would set are pitifully poor. The target stages for achieving a SAP rating of 60 for accommodation in public ownership are 50 per cent. by 1999, 70 per cent. by 2002 and 90 per cent. by 2005. If those are compared with the current averages that I outlined, the average for 1999 would be only 30 per cent., which is less than the SAP rating for the Northern Ireland Housing Executive and the average for public and private sector housing in Manchester now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robathan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point and I want the Bill to have a real impact, but he is arguing against himself. We want the measure to prove flexible and effective. If the hon Gentleman's amendment inserts into the Bill standards that he describes as pitifully low, does not that work against his argument? If, instead, there was guidance, through which we could set higher standards and continue to apply pressure without new legislation, would not that be a more effective way of delivering the goods?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simpson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There would be no problem if we set standards that were obligations. That is the crunch—the gap between guidance and advice, and statutory obligations. I would be happy to build into the Bill the power for the Minister to set higher standards. I would not have objected to an amendment that did not specify the year 2005, but left the matter open to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would see no problem in a commitment in this House to set standards higher than those that we have discussed. Unnecessary and avoidable deaths are occurring in this country because we have no standards. We do not compare with standards set by our European partners 20 to 25 years ago. That is why people are living in abjectly fuel-poor properties and dying unnecessarily; their incomes are insufficient to meet heating bills that are massively out of proportion to those of their counterparts in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. That is why we should set objective standards. It would be a tragic waste of an opportunity if we failed to set even the relative standards initially proposed by the hon. Member for Christchurch and retreated from the standards that the Department of the Environment requires for new properties, which should be the benchmark applying to all properties in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert B. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is ironic that I mentioned SAP rating and said that it should be part of our approach. It will be, and the hon. Gentleman should accept that rather than press the matter to a vote.

12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Nottingham, South has not dealt with the problems that I pointed out to him concerning the changing nature of the SAP rating process, the rigidity of incorporating it in the Bill and the difficulty of making precise measurements when the UK stock is vast. I shall use the same arguments that apply to inserting the figure of 30 per cent. in the Bill. SAP rating is a vital ingredient for moving towards an energy-efficient stock, but common sense ought to tell the hon. Gentleman that it is better to make such provision in the guidance rather than in the Bill. I invite him not to press his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give the Committee some guidance. I thank hon. Members for their support on a number of points. I look forward to the hon. Member for Eltham standing by my side—he is not here at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point made by many hon. Members about the historical record of local authorities. I listened carefully to the debate on the amendment of the hon. Member for Nottingham, South. There is no doubt that inviting SAP ratings into the Bill would provide a helpful way forward, in view of our discussions and the many reservations that I and many other people outside who support the Bill have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Nottingham, South mentioned Sweden. I lived there from 1969 to 1971 and it may be partly because of that experience that I am the promoter of the Bill. From experience, I know only too well about the comfort in which pensioners live in that country compared with how pensioners in Britain live. I strongly associate myself with the hon. Gentleman's arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that hon. Members wish to move on and I shall not labour the points that have been made. I welcome the Minister's assurances and clarifications. We could get into a great argument about whether the strategy is the Government's or the nation's—some of us have an opinion about whether the government of the nation still belongs to the people. The Minister made a valuable point about the changing nature of SAP. I think that he will have gathered from members of the Committee that we are concerned about the changing nature of Ministers at the top. That is our problem with incorporating all the measures into the guidance. I hope that the Minister will understand how we feel. He knows, I know and you know, Sir John, that that issue has caused much controversy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Minister's reassurance that the figure of 30 per cent. will appear in the guidance—that is a step forward. Of course, the guidance notes are important, but many members of the Committee are relying on the Minister, his future efforts and the way in which he uses the guidance notes and deals with local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to withdraw the amendment relating to targets and given the Minister's assurances on amendment (b)—about the targeting of resources—I hope that he will

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I broadly welcome new clause 2. We have been dogged by the fact that the Government have largely rephrased the existing Bill. There is a change from the Secretary of State producing a timetable for action to producing a timetable for reports for action. I have reservations about the change, as do other members of the Committee. We could perhaps have made more of that matter, but, in the interests of forging a workable consensus on the Bill, I am prepared to accept the new clause. I do not believe that the effects will be greatly different from the original provisions in the Bill. However, it makes it even more vital for councils' records of progress to be in the public domain. Parliament and the public must know what is happening. Trailblazers should be held up as examples to encourage those who are not blazing ahead quite as fast. Those who are dragging their heels should be put in the spotlight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Secretary of State to make an annual statement to Parliament, followed by a short debate on progress in the previous 12 months. I realise that it would not be easy to include that in the Bill, and it is not essential, but the laying before Parliament of a statement may just mean placing it in the Library. I hope that we will be given a written statement and an opportunity to debate the matter. Debates on the Floor of the House will encourage local authorities to ensure that they are keeping up with the standards and guidance put forward by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much play has been made that there will be no targets on the face of the Bill, as we would have liked, but guidance notes will ensure that things happen. An annual statement that is debated would be very important in view

of certain provisions in the Bill not having been accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment (b) is slightly different from my amendment last week, which was tabled in anticipation of changes that might be made following discussions of targets. It is crucial that the guidance notes are adhered to. I hope that the Minister will accept amendment (b) to Government new clause 2. To make the Bill effective, it is vital that the Secretary of State should use all his powers to enforce guidance on local authorities. I seek the Minister's assurance yet again. It is a simple amendment, and I hope that the Committee will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert B.

We are not happy with the drafting of the hon. Lady's amendment, but there is no difference of opinion between us over the matter of reporting. If the hon. Lady will let me, I shall certainly consider that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also clarify when the legislation will be implemented. We obviously want to bring the Bill into line with the local authority year from April to April and we may need to treat differently those authorities where reorganisation may pose a problem—although, at the moment, there are not many such authorities. On that basis, I ask the Committee to support the new clauses and the remaining drafting amendment No. 13.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 7 applies to Northern Ireland. The Committee has already covered that when discussing amendment No. 1, so I shall not spend much time on it. I and other hon. Members welcome the application of the Bill to Northern Ireland under new clause 6. Northern Ireland is among the colder parts of the United Kingdom and it would benefit substantially from the Bill's implementation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ideally, I should prefer it if the energy conservation authorities that will implement the Bill were the district councils in Northern Ireland. Wherever possible, local democratic control would be my choice. However, I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
recognise the unique and sensitive situation in Northern Ireland and I am willing to see the responsibilities under the Bill conferred upon the Northern Ireland Housing Executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the situation in Northern Ireland will progress enough in the future to allow the Government to increase the role of local authorities, and that they will be acting as energy conservation authorities in due course—as we hope their counterparts will be in Britain. I understand that the Prime Minister is keen for extra powers to be given to district councils in Northern Ireland to provide some democratic legitimacy. I hope that the new clause will be approved by the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<li>"(2) This Act shall come into force on such day as may be appointed by order made by statutory instrument by the Secretary of State.</li>
	<li>(3) Different days may be appointed under subsection (2) for different purposes, different energy conservation authorities, different descriptions of energy conservation authority and different areas.".</li></div> <!-- ul -->
It would be helpful to the Committee if I made a few comments about the amendment. It would give the Secretary of State power to bring the Bill's provisions into force by statutory instrument and to appoint different days for different purposes, different authorities or different areas. The reason behind the amendment is not to seek to delay or frustrate the coming into force of the Bill, but to allow for necessary flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first step to be taken will be for the Secretary of State to draw up and issue the guidance envisaged in new clause 3. While we shall go about that with all reasonable speed we will want to consult, and it is not possible to predict the timetable precisely. It would, therefore, be unwise to be constrained by a set date for coming into force in the Bill. We would not want authorities to be under any formal duty to begin to prepare reports until the guidance was available. That is one reason why it makes sense to be able to introduce different provisions on different days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
As for the power to appoint different days for different authorities, I have already referred, in relation to the setting of dates for the submission of initial reports, to the consequences of local government reorganisation and the likely need to set different timetables for the areas affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is our intention to be ready with guidance, so that the Bill can come into force on 1 April 1996 for local authorities where reorganisation is not a factor, to harmonise commencement with the beginning of the new financial year. Our purpose in introducing the amendment is not to be dilatory, but to be able to adapt to differing circumstances. I am sure that the hon. Member for Christchurch and other members of the Committee will not be backward in keeping us well up to speed. I commend the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's commitment that the Bill will come into force on 1 April. I had hoped that it would be 1 January. I understand, however, that it will be more helpful given that 1 April is the start of the financial year. I seek clarification of exactly how you envisage dealing with some of the authorities that have yet to be made, as it were. You were not specific in that regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Sir John. One of these days I will learn how to address people in this place. I hope that the Minister will clarify the point. It would be only fair to local authorities, especially those that support us, to ensure that others are kept up to scratch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert B. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The general principle in the case of local authorities undergoing reorganisation, which does not involve this legislation, is that when there are great demands on their management time they should not be burdened unnecessarily. Nevertheless, we do not want any dilatoriness as a result of that. I shall consult local authorities to find out what they consider practicable, and return to the matter on Report. I do not imagine that there will be any great difference of opinion between members of the Committee about this practical consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I thank all members of the Committee for the extremely constructive and informative debates that we have had. Parliament's reputation is enhanced by such debates on such a subject. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Christchurch for the constructive and tenacious way in which she fought for her proposal to get on to the statute book and to be capable of implementation.
