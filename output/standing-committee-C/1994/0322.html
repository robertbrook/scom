CONFISCATION RELATING TO A COURSE OF CRIMINAL CONDUCT</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Hannam <span class='memberconstituency'>(Exeter)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was much impressed by hon. Members' scrutiny of the clause at our previous sitting. The clause is the heart of the Bill. It attempts to strengthen substantially the courts' powers under part VI of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 to enable them to deal more effectively with offenders who amass proceeds from persistent offending. The courts' existing powers are extremely limited and, with your permission, Mr. Hill, I shall explain why.<br><br>
Under part VI of the 1988 Act the courts are empowered to confiscate only the proceeds of any offences of which a defendant stands convicted in the current proceedings, plus the proceeds of any offences taken into consideration by the court in those proceedings. Unfortunately, all too often the offences of which a defendant has been convicted represent only a small proportion of those actually committed and a confiscation order merely scratches the surface of a criminal's true benefit. In theory, the provision enabling the courts to confiscate the proceeds of offences taken into consideration may enable them to confiscate proceeds more realistically aligned with a defendant's true benefits, but in practice offences are taken into consideration only if a defendant consents.<br><br>
Criminals, as we know all too well, are aware that the more offences they allow to be taken into consideration, the more they are likely to have to pay under a confiscation order. It is hardly surprising that cases that are clearly appropriate for confiscation orders cannot be prosecuted satisfactorily at present. I have no doubt that those difficulties are largely to blame for the lamentable statistics on the amounts that have been confiscated under part VI of the 1988 Act.<br><br>
The shortcomings of part VI of the 1988 Act are particularly obvious and acute in the sort of economic crimes that are committed by professional criminals. Two such crimes which worry hon. Members and the general public are counterfeiting and the production of pornography. In such offences the criminal's profit accrues not from the commission of one major offence but from the repeated commission of the same offence, which may be relatively minor—for example, the production of one video. That same offence is committed thousands, tens of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
thousands and sometimes millions of times. Under existing provisions, the courts may confiscate the proceeds of a single major offence but have no powers to deal with the sort of crimes that consist of repeated commission of the same relatively minor offence. For the entire proceeds of a course of such offending to be confiscated, each offence would have to be charged and convicted separately, which is wholly impractical, or each offence could be taken into consideration by the court, but that does not happen in practice.<br><br>
The solution is to allow the courts to make assumptions about the illegal origin of the defendant's property similar to those in drug trafficking legislation. The court should be empowered to make an assumption that a defendant's property has come from crime. The assumptions should, of course, be subject to the rebuttal by a defendant, and clause 2 allows for that. Once it has made such assumptions, the court should be able to order a defendant to pay an amount equal to the sum total of the proceeds exposed by the making of the assumptions. In keeping with the legislation generally, the court should not be able to order a defendant to pay more than the amount of realisable property available for confiscation where that is less than the amount of the proceeds revealed by the operation of the assumptions. Those are all sensible safeguards.<br><br>
I have no difficulty with the principles underlying the making of such assumptions, whether in the drug trafficking legislation or in part VI of the Criminal Justice Act, 1988 as amended by this clause. It seems to me—and, I am sure to all members of the Committee—entirely reasonable to make defendants account for the lawful origin of their property where they have been convicted of crimes from which financial benefit is derived. The power to make assumptions is particularly important in respect of the sort of repeated offending that I have just described, because frequently no trace will remain of individual offences and the true extent of the offending will be peculiarly in the knowledge of the criminal.<br><br>
Having stated the principles behind the amendments, I must add that the power to make such assumptions can have far-reaching effects and may result in the confiscation of the whole of a defendant's property. Part VI of the 1988 Act applies to crime generally, including a few highly lucrative summary offences. Great care must be taken to ensure that the wide-ranging power to make assumptions is brought to bear only in appropriate cases. For that reason the court will be able to make the assumptions only where written notice is tendered by the prosecutor.<br><br>
In addition, the court will have a discretion as to whether or not it makes the assumptions in the case of a particular defendant. I am aware that there are doubts in some quarters as to whether it is appropriate to grant the courts such a discretion, bearing in mind the recent amendment to the drug trafficking legislation depriving the courts of the same discretion under those provisions. It is a question of striking the proper balance between the extreme nature of drug trafficking offences and the general nature of the offences covered by the Bill. That is a necessary safeguard, given the wide range of offences to which part VI of the 1988 Act applies.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0360">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
Further safeguards are built into subsection (5). The court will have a general power not to make an assumption where it believes that there would be a serious risk of injustice. Specific provision is made to avoid the risk of double accounting, and the court will have the power not to make an assumption in relation to property taken account of in a previous confiscation order. Those are all sensible safeguards.<br><br>
I come finally to the question of triggering offences, which featured so prominently in last week's debate. The purpose of clause 2 is to attack the proceeds of persistent offending. I have no desire to see the power to make assumptions used in trivial cases, and I am sure that all members of the Committee share that view. One must tread warily in these matters and I am anxious that these new powers should not fall into disrepute. However, some hon. Members drew attention to some anomalies and pitfalls in the clause as it is drafted. It is a question of striking the correct balance and I intend to reflect carefully on the points that were raised. I shall draw my conclusions before Report on whether we have identified the correct threshold, or whether that needs to be adjusted. In winding up last week's debate I expressed some sympathy for a revision of that threshold.<br><br>
I conclude by recommending that clause 2 stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Clappison <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hertsmere)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to make a brief speech on clause 2, following the clear exposition by my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter (Sir J. Hannam). I should like to make two points. First, I want to re-emphasise what my hon. Friend made clear, which is the question of the "relevant conduct" that is attacked by the clause; and, secondly, I shall add to the list of examples given by my hon. Friend of the sort of offending covered by the clause.<br><br>
On the first of those issues—the "relevant criminal conduct" referred to in subsection (3) (a)—I shall spell out my understanding that that phrase refers to conduct during the preceding six years to which the assumptions relate, not simply to convictions or offences that are taken into consideration.<br><br>
I hope that the clause will attack all such conduct. When the trigger mechanism is activated through the notice from the prosecution, and when the necessary convictions under subsection (1) (c) are taken into account, the courts should consider what may be the "relevant criminal conduct" of the offender. His conduct should be viewed more widely than comprising just offences that are taken into consideration. It is very important to spell out clearly that "relevant criminal conduct" means the whole of a defendant's conduct over the relevant period, not simply the offences of which he has been convicted and which are being taken into consideration.<br><br>
The scheme of the Act follows closely that of the Drug Trafficking Act 1994. Under that Act, when an offender is convicted of a drug trafficking offence, the court considers
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
whether he has benefited from drug trafficking in general over the relevant preceding period. I believe that the clause will work in a similar way. As my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter rightly said, that is why the clause represents an attack on the lifestyle of crime. While the clause may seem draconian, it is justified by the notice that is given and by the trigger mechanism of the convictions. It will also be subject to the safeguards that are given in subsection (5). When the prosecution takes the view that it is appropriate to serve notice, and the court concurs in that view, it will be right to operate the draconian provision. The people involved cause serious problems to the public through their conduct.<br><br>
Here I come to my second point. My hon. Friend gave the examples of counterfeiting and the supply of pornographic videos and materials. They are good examples of the conduct at which the provisions are aimed. I should like to add a third example of my own—those who handle stolen property. I am worried that our criminal justice system does not attach sufficient importance to the role of those who handle stolen property. The clause will deal with the man who appears before a court with the necessary qualifying convictions—perhaps for handling stolen property—who is found to be in possession of what is often described as an Aladdin's cave of stolen property. Some of the vast quantity of stolen property in his possession could be identified as a consequence of the convictions and offences that are taken into consideration, as a result of which he is appearing before the court, but much of what remains might not be traceable to any offence. In that situation, the assumption that I mentioned earlier, should be made.<br><br>
That person might have many videos, televisions, expensive stereo equipment or jewellery, and he might be making a good living from crime by peddling those stolen goods. He would also be causing misery to the victims of crime. Handlers of stolen goods are important in the chain of criminality—they provide an incentive for burglars to go out and do their wretched work. It is absolutely right to hit the handlers of stolen goods. Many of my constituents, who have suffered from the appalling offence of burglary, also take that view.<br><br>
It is not simply burglars who are responsible for such offences and for all the misery that is caused by a break-in at someone's home, which includes invasion of privacy, damage, disturbance and so on, but the men who stand behind them, handling stolen goods and providing an economy of crime, who support those who commit offences of burglary. I hope that the clause will hit at such people. Although some aspects of it may appear draconian, it is absolutely justified because when it affects those people they will realise that they stand to lose a great deal from participating in that type of criminality.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oliver Heald <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hertfordshire, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Following on from the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter, it is right to look at subsection (3) of new section 72AA in conjunction with other provisions. It is not apparent merely by looking at subsection (3) that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0361">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
relevant criminal conduct referred to in paragraph (a) would include offences committed during the previous six years. The definition of relevant criminal conduct is given in clause 1, new subsection (1D) as being the offence before the court
<br><blockquote><p>"taken together with any other offences of a relevant description which are either … offences of which he is convicted in the same proceedings, or"</p></blockquote>
offences taken into consideration.<br><br>
That would not in itself include offences committed during the previous six years, although some of the offences taken into consideration would be within that period, as would some of the offences of which a defendant was charged. But the Bill's provisions are aimed at the mischief of lifestyle crime over a period of six years, including other offences. Once it has been decided that the assumptions may apply, the assumptions in new section 72AA(4) become relevant. One of the assumptions is:
<br><blockquote><p>"that any property appearing to the court to have been transferred to the defendant at any time in"</p></blockquote>
the six years
<br><blockquote><p>"was received by him, at the earliest time when he appears to the court to have held it, in connection with the commission of offences to which this Part of this Act applies".</p></blockquote>
Those offences are either indictable offences or the offences that are set out in the schedule. Another assumption in new subsection (4) is:
<br><blockquote><p>"that any expenditure of his in the relevant period was met out of payments received by him in connection with the commission of offences"</p></blockquote>
of that category.<br><br>
Assuming that the defendant cannot show that the property came into his possession honestly or that the expenditure was made honestly, the assumptions about property and expenditure are introduced but are not covered by relevant criminal conduct in new subsection(1D). Instead, we must look at new section 72AA(6) which states
<br><blockquote><p>"Where the assumptions specified in subsection (4) above are made in any case, the offences from which, in accordance with those assumptions, the defendant is assumed to have benefited"—</p></blockquote>
the notional offences from which the property has been derived—
<br><blockquote><p>"shall be treated as if they were comprised, for the purposes of this Part of this Act, in the conduct which is to be treated, in that case, as relevant criminal conduct".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is making a valuable contribution which goes into more detail on the point that I made about the meaning of relevant criminal conduct. By
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
referring to new section 72AA(6) he has reached the nub of the matter. New section 72AA(3)(a) refers to relevant criminal conduct and in clause 1, new subsection (1D) defines relevant criminal conduct as convictions and offences taken into consideration. Does my hon. Friend agree that new section 72AA(6) interprets criminal conduct much more widely than the offences of which a person has been convicted or which have been taken into consideration and includes lifestyle offences? It is a valuable subsection which makes all the difference.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend because that is exactly the point that I was trying to make. New section 72AA(3) and the definition in new subsection (1D) is the starting point and then the assumptions are made. At that point, a further addition can be made to the scheme because once the assumptions have been made and the property and expenditure has been identified, if no decent explanation has been offered, notional offences must have been committed for that property to have been derived from crime. At that point, relevant criminal conduct has that extra meaning.<br><br>
It is right that that matter should be canvassed in Committee because, if it were not, there might be some confusion at a later date. It is necessary to deal with that matter in that way rather than in the way that it is dealt with in the Drug Trafficking Act 1994. Drug trafficking is a clear lifestyle of its own, whereas other sorts of criminal lifestyle, such as that of the pornographer or fence, are not so easy to define. That is why the concept of relevant criminal conduct is necessary and it can be built upon once the assumptions have been made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Hannam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some important points have been raised, especially about relevant conduct, on which I want to reassure my hon. Friends the Members for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) and for Hertfordshire, North (Mr. Heald). Under clause 2, if a person commits the qualifying offences in new section 72AA(1)(c), the assumptions, which are set out in new section 72AA(4), can be applied retrospectively by the court covering the whole six-year period prior to institution of the current proceedings. The assumptions are to be made in respect of property that is assumed to be derived from criminal conduct carried out during that period. Put another way, the court is to make the assumption that the defendant has committed offences of which he may not necessarily have been convicted throughout that six-year period. I can confirm that the position is exactly as stated by my hon. Friend.<br><br>
I am sorry that some of the wording in the Bill is unclear, but new subsection (1D) in clause 1 defines relevant criminal conduct. Subject to new section 72AA(6), relevant criminal conduct is defined as offences of which a person is convicted or offences which are taken into consideration in determining a sentence. However, new section 72AA(6) provides that where the assumptions are made, the defendant is assumed to have benefited from offences. That is, he is assumed to have benefited from offences of which he has never been convicted. That is the important point. Therefore, new section 72AA(4)(a) provides that:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0362">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 49</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"any property … transferred to the defendant at any time in the relevant period was received by him … in connection with the commission of offences to which this Part of this Act applies."</p></blockquote>
It is unnecessary for the defendant to have been convicted of those offences. Furthermore, it is assumed that the defendant has carried out conduct which would amount to an offence. It is unnecessary for that conduct to be specified. The same applies to the assumptions in subsections (b) and (c) of new section 72AA(4).<br><br>
In the Aladdin's cave situation—in which a fence may be brought before the courts for a series of receiving offences—provided the qualifying offence triggers are met, the same assumptions can be applied. All the important points raised by my hon. Friend are covered.</span></p>

PROVISION OF INFORMATION BY PROSECUTOR</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Garnier <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harborough)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 5, line 2, leave out from first 'section' to end of line 3. The amendment would remove the unnecessary words
<br><blockquote><p>"and requires a statement under this section from the prosecutor"</p></blockquote>
from clause 3(1)(b).<br><br>
Under the Bill, if
<br><blockquote><p>"the prosecutor has given written notice to the court for the purposes of subsection (1)(a) of section 71 above"—</p></blockquote>
which we debated last Wednesday, or
<br><blockquote><p>"the court is proceeding in pursuance of subsection (1)(b) of that section"</p></blockquote>
the prosecutor can do a number of things. Under clause 1(2), subsection (1A) is lowered into the Criminal Justice Act 1988. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The court shall first determine whether the offender has benefited from any relevant criminal conduct".</p></blockquote>
I am sorry, I am misleading the Committee. We should be talking about section 73. Clause 3 (1) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"For subsection (1) of section 73 of the 1988 Act (effect of provision of statement by prosecutor) there shall be substituted the following subsections—
<ul>
<li>"(1) Subsection (1A) below applies in a case where a person has been convicted of an offence of a relevant description if—</li>
<ol>
<li>the prosecutor has given written notice to the court for the purposes of subsection (1)(a) of section 71 above; or</li>
<li>the court is proceeding in pursuance of subsection (1)(b) of that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
section and requires a statement under this section from the prosecutor."</li>
</ol></ul></p></blockquote>
I am asking my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter whether the additional words
<br><blockquote><p>"and requires a statement under this section from the prosecutor"</p></blockquote>
are strictly necessary.<br><br>
The Bill requires the prosecutor to give written notice to the court that he considers it appropriate for the court to proceed under the relevant section. Alternatively, the court itself can decide that it is appropriate to examine the proceeds of a defendant's criminal activities. Is it necessary to load the Bill up with otiose wording? In my submission, the Bill would be just as effective if the words were removed, because the prosecutor can give written notice under subsection (1)(a) and the court can proceed, as we already know, under subsection (1)(b) of section 73 of the 1988 Act, as amended.<br><br>
There is nothing in the remainder of the clause that depends on the court's requiring a statement under the section referred to. Neither the prosecutor nor the court is in any way inhibited from proceeding to an inquiry, or from ordering statements to be exchanged between the prosecutor and the defendant, or from requiring information to be provided to the court by either of those parties or inter parties. Those additional few words are simply words and add nothing of any value.<br><br>
My particular beef is that so much of our legislation is full of unnecessary wording, much of it incomprehensible. If I can play a small part in any way to reduce unnecessary verbiage in our legislation, so much the better.<br><br>
Last week, I referred the Committee to the warning of Lord Justice Rose, as reported in the national press, about the mass of legislation coming from the House that affects criminal proceedings and the administration of justice. Much of that legislation is confusing, contradictory and should be corrected. I should be happy to put my shoulder to anything that we could do today to reduce the problems that Lord Justice Rose has outlined.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point that I thought that my hon. Friend might have wished to make is that, as the Bill is drafted, it would be possible for the court to proceed of its own motion without requiring a statement. The words that he wants to delete would remove that possibility. Is he suggesting that in some circumstances it would be sensible for the court to proceed without a statement or that a statement should always be required?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garnier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In my opinion, a statement should always be required. Clause 3(1A) provides that where subsection (1A) applies
<br><blockquote><p>"the prosecutor shall, within such period as the court may direct, tender to the court a statement as to any matters relevant—

<ol>
<li>(a) to determining whether the defendant has benefited from any relevant criminal conduct; or</li>
<li>(b) to an assessment of the value of the defendant's benefit from that conduct;</li></ol>
and, where such a statement is tendered in a case in which a declaration has been made for the purposes of subsection (1)(b) of section 72AA above, that statement shall also set out all such information available to the prosecutor as may be relevant for the purposes of subsections (4) and (5)(b) or (c) of that section."</p></blockquote>
That subsection already allows for the contingency about which my hon. Friend is concerned. I may have misunderstood his point, however.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may have done. The clause, as drafted, provides that if the court is proceeding of its own motion, and requires a statement, the prosecutor must provide one under subsection (1A). However, were the amendment included, the court would proceed at its own motion and, whether or not it required a statement, it would have to have one, because the prosecutor would tender the statement. The option in the clause as drafted—where the court can say, "Look, we're going to proceed of our own motion and not bother with a statement"—would be removed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand what my hon. Friend is saying, but I am not sure whether I share his doubts about the good sense in removing those unnecessary words. The court always has inherent jurisdiction and power to act in the interests of justice, not only in civil but criminal cases, as my hon. Friend, who has experienced both arms of the law, knows. The philosophy behind my proposal is to reduce unnecessary verbiage. If my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter can persuade me that those 10 words are essential, I shall be happy to reconsider. However, having studied the Bill with care, I am not convinced that those words add anything to it or that they are necessary. I want clarity, speed and openness in all our criminal proceedings. It would be unthinkable for a court to spring a case on a defendant, any more than it would be likely to spring a case on the prosecutor. There must be an exchange of cases. I cannot for the life of me understand how the reference to a requirement that I want to remove would in any way endanger the thrust of the Bill. Having made those points, I invite other members of the Committee to give their views.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remember being involved in a criminal case some years ago in which the defendant owned a house. He was officially unemployed and there was no obvious explanation of how he came to own the house. He did not have a mortgage on it and he had been unemployed for years. Of course, he did have a five page list of previous convictions for burglary.<br><br>
In some cases, a criminal who has been convicted may be prepared to say, "I have this house which has basically been bought with the proceeds of crime. I am happy for assumptions to be made and the house to be confiscated because I realise that, if any reasonable inquiry is made, confiscation will be inevitable." As I understand it, such situations can be dealt with under the Bill. The court could
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
decide of its own motion to say, a man or woman having been convicted,
<br><blockquote><p>"We understand from both counsels what the circumstances are. We will proceed of our own motion and not bother with a statement because the circumstances are all agreed. We will move to make a confiscation order."</p></blockquote>
The effect of the amendment would be to insist that the court had a statement—that is my understanding, but I am quite prepared to be persuaded that I am wrong. Under the Bill, if the court proceeds under its own motion under new subsection (1) (b) in clause 3(1) and requires a statement, the prosecutor must tender one. If the words
<br><blockquote><p>"and requires a statement under this section from prosecutor"</p></blockquote>
were deleted, the clause would provide that whenever the court were proceeding under new subsection (1)(b), the prosecutor should tender a statement to the court. That might in certain circumstances mean that a statement would be produced quite unnecessarily. I am quite willing to be corrected if I am wrong, but that is my understanding of the position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Hannam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North has already stated my case very effectively. As my hon. Friend the Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) observed when moving the amendment, under the Bill a prosecutor's statement must be provided to the court in every case in which the prosecutor gives notice that he wishes a confiscation order to be made. It is not obligatory for him to seek a confiscation. However, the provision of a statement will not be mandatory in cases in which the court decides of its own volition to trigger the confiscation procedures.<br><br>
Let me explain the thinking behind those provisions. Cases in which the prosecutor triggers the confiscation procedures will involve substantial proceeds and are likely to be extremely complicated. As a result, a prosecutor's statement will be essential in such cases. That is why a statement will always have to be produced where it is the prosecutor who triggers the confiscation.<br><br>
The position in cases in which confiscation is triggered by the court is rather different. We must bear in mind that such cases will almost invariably have been considered and rejected by the prosecutor at the outset. Consequently, cases in which a court will wish to make a confiscation order of its own volition will be rare. However, information may come to the notice of the court during the trial which justifies making a confiscation order, and the court may not need any further information from the prosecutor. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Harborough does not want to make the proceedings more bureaucratic, but it would be bureaucratic in such circumstances to require the prosecutor to prepare a statement. On the other hand, if the court believes that it has insufficient information on which to base a confiscation order, it may direct the prosecutor to produce a statement. That is a sensible approach that offers the flexibility that we would want to deal with different sorts of cases involving differing proceeds. I hope that in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0364">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 53</span>
light of that explanation, my hon. Friend will agree that his amendment, while well-meaning, is unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garnier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friends the Members for Hertfordshire, North and for Exeter for so politely resisting my blandishments. I can tell from the silence of other members of the Committee that my amendment has not been greeted with overwhelming enthusiasm and it would waste time to invite the Committee to divide on it. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Hannam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 3 may, at first sight, appear incidental to the main provisions of the Bill but it is a fundamental part of the new procedures.<br><br>
A statement submitted to the court by the prosecutor is relevant to the effective operation of the confiscation legislation because it provides the court with the information required to determine whether the defendant has benefited from crime and the extent of the benefit, so that a confiscation order can be made in the right amount. It may come as a surprise to some hon. Members, therefore, to learn that, at present, the prosecutor is not obliged to provide the court with a statement at all, despite the fact that confiscation under part VI of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 can currently proceed only when the prosecutor gives written notice to the court.<br><br>
The Bill rectifies that shortcoming. Clause 3 requires the prosecutor to provide the court with a statement in every case when confiscation is sought. It also empowers the court to require the prosecutor to provide a further statement at any time during the confiscation hearing. Moreover, when the court starts the confiscation procedures of its own volition—when the prosecutor did not trigger the proceedings by giving written notice—the court can require the prosecutor to produce a statement and, indeed, further statements if it considers them necessary. Special provision is made for cases involving the assumptions. Where new section 72AA applies, under which the court may make the assumptions, the prosecutor's statement must include all the information available to the prosecutor on certain specific subjects relevant to the making of the assumptions, in particular property transferred to the defendant and the defendant's expenditure in the six years before proceedings were instituted.<br><br>
As hon. Members will readily appreciate, the information of interest to the court in cases involving the assumptions may be considerable. The court is looking not only at the proceeds of specific offences but at all property received or spent by the defendant in the six years before proceedings were instituted. The financial dealings of major criminals, in particular, can be extremely intricate and may involve the laundering of proceeds through
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
numerous bank accounts, shell companies or offshore operations. In complicated cases, thousands of transactions may be involved an it is vital that as much of the relevant information as possible is put to the court. Clause 3 aims to secure that.<br><br>
It is a very important clause and I recommend that it stand part of the Bill</span></p>

PROVISION OF INFORMATION BY DEFENDANT</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Hannam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 4 is closely linked to clause 3. Whereas clause 3 deals with the provision of information to the court by the prosecutor, clause 4 deals with the provision of information to the court by the defendant. It will ensure that the court's ability to make a confiscation order under part VI of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 is not impaired by a lack of disclosure on the part of the defendant. The High Court already possesses the power to order the defendant to provide information about his assets in cases where, for example, a restraint order has been made by the court. Clause 4 provides the Crown court and the magistrates court, as the case may be, with a general power to order the defendant at any stage to provide information to assist it in carrying out its functions under part VI of the 1988 Act. The information required could include details about the extent of the defendant's benefit from crime or the amount of realisable property available for confiscation.<br><br>
It is, of course, important that confiscation hearings should not be unduly delayed when additional information is being sought. Clause 4, therefore, allows the court to set a time limit for provision of the information that it requires. If the defendant fails to provide this information within the time set by the court without reasonable excuse, the court will be able to draw adverse inferences from his failure to respond.</span></p>

REVIEW OF CASES WHERE PROCEEDS OF CRIME NOT ASSESSED</div> <!-- title -->
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garnier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 28, in page 8, line 21, leave out 'six' and insert 'ten'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 29, in clause 6, page 10, line 11, leave out 'six' and insert 'ten'.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0365">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
No. 30, in clause 7, page 12, line 7, leave out 'six' and insert 'ten'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garnier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are identical in that they would change the number "six" to "ten" in clauses 5, 6 and 7. Clause 5 deals with cases where the proceeds of crime have not been assessed, clause 6 deals with the revision of the assessment of the proceeds of crime, and clause 7 deals with the revision of the assessment of the sums to be recovered. I believe that the time allowed for each of those three separate stages should be extended.<br><br>
Under clause 5, when a person has been convicted, and if the prosecutor has not given written notice under the previous clauses so that no determination will have been made, evidence that subsequently comes to light to suggest that the convicted person has benefited from his criminal activity can be tested.<br><br>
Under clause 6, if the prosecutor or the court later concludes that the proceeds of criminal activity should be reassessed because further information has come to light to suggest that a defendant had made a greater—or possibly a lesser—benefit than was at first thought, the court can consider whether the original assessment should be revised.<br><br>
Under clause 7, the court, when considering the relevant information, can decide that the amount to be recovered from the criminal should be higher.<br><br>
At the moment, the Bill restricts to six years post-conviction the time over which the court can look back. New section 74A(9) in clause 5 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"No application shall be entertained by the court under this section if it is made after the end of the period of six years beginning with the date of conviction."</p></blockquote>
The same restriction applies in the other two clauses in the trinity.<br><br>
During last year's proceedings of the Select Committee on Home Affairs, which was investigating organised and international crime, the hon. Member for Wallsend (Mr. Byers) asked Caroline MacCready, an official in the international criminal policy division of the Home Office, how much of the money being laundered through the City of London represented the benefits of criminal activity. Her reporting of the Home Office memorandum was that it was in the region of £2.5 billion to £4 billion every year. I have no idea—I do not suppose that other hon. Members have any idea—whether that assessment has been revised or made more accurate since then. In any event, it was a huge sum of money.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Ann Coffey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stockport)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Disgraceful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garnier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is disgraceful. I am happy to record that the hon. Member for Stockport (Ms Coffey) and the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche)—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We must stop this tennis match.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
The hon. Member for Harborough must speak to the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garnier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to do so, Mr. Hill, but there have been sedentary interventions from Opposition Members although they have been fairly piano as there are only two in the Committee, in contrast to the Government's representation and the Minister's presence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Barbara Roche <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hornsey and Wood Green)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman well knows, at our previous sitting and on Second Reading the Opposition gave their full support to the Bill, but I repeat that some of the contributions last week and today have been unnecessarily long and aimed at a different agenda—preventing other private Member's Bills from having their proper allotted time in Committee. The contributions have not all been relevant to the vital subject of seizing the proceeds of crime.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garnier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a novel concept, Mr. Hill, to support by absence. That is presumably similar to the so-called principled abstentions of the Opposition on other Second Readings, not least on criminal justice legislation. I shall not be diverted into a spat with the Opposition over this broadly sensible Bill. If the hon. Lady will stop interrupting, I shall make progress.<br><br>
It is important to bear in mind the huge sums of money from the proceeds of criminal activity that have apparently been laundered through the City of London. I want my hon. Friend the Member for exeter to bear in mind the huge sums of money involved in organised crime and the sophistication of the modern organised criminal. We are discussing not a man in a stripy jersey and a bag of swag on his back, but high-powered lawyers, financiers and business men who are used to transferring financial instruments electronically from one market to another and to organising highly sophisticated arrangements to siphon away huge sums of money from drug running, international terrorism and other criminal activities. Given such sophistication, is six years post the date of conviction sufficient time to allow the police and other criminal investigation authorities throughout the world to unravel the spider's web? I submit that even 10 years may be too short a period in some cases.<br><br>
The Association of Chief Police Officers, the Police superintendants Association and the Police Federation submitted a joint memorandum to the Home Affairs Committee for its deliberation last year. Although I am tempted to do so, I shall not go through each of the 30 recommendations in that memorandum, but I shall refer to one or two of the matters that were drawn to the Committee's attention because it is important to back up my amendment not only with words but with evidence for my fears.<br><br>
The memorandum accepted the submission on organised crime adopted by the National Criminal Intelligence Service which is as follows:
<br><blockquote><p>"Organised crime constitutes any enterprise, or group of persons engaged in continuing illegal activities, which has as its primary purpose the generation of profits, irrespective of national boundaries."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0366">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 57</span>
The Bill does quite a lot to ensure that ill-gotten gains are recovered and not allowed to benefit the criminal or his dependants, but I fear that narrowing the investigation post conviction to only six years is to place an unhelpful restraint on the investigative powers of the law enforcement agencies.<br><br>
The memorandum identified the characteristics or organised crime as:
<br><blockquote><p>"Power, profit, planning, project crime, structure, self perpetuating, successful, access to supply of crime goods and services, continuing, conspiracy, controlled, corrupting, intricate, seeking immunity, intimidating, not impulsive".</p></blockquote>
Those are descriptions of the ways in which organised criminals behave and of some of the things that they seek. Essentially, profit is the most important motive.<br><br>
The memorandum
<br><blockquote><p>"Some crime groups found in Italy, US, Latin America and the Far East exhibit all 16 factors."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to state:
<br><blockquote><p>"While the expression, 'organised crime', is used frequently in the United Kingdom, it is usually applied to career criminals"—</p></blockquote>
or lifestyle criminals, with which we are presently dealing—
<br><blockquote><p>"involved in serious or major crime rather than organised crime groups as defined above."</p></blockquote>
A witness to the Home Affairs Committee was asked—I am not sure by whom, but it may have been the Chairman—whether there were any criminals who could be described as Mr. Bigs in the sense of being mafia leaders. The witness, who was a policeman, responded that while there were no Mr. Bigs, there were plenty of Mr. Big Enoughs. It is the Mr. Big Enoughs who are sufficiently sophisticated to have access to financial and legal advice, despite the fact that they may have been imprisoned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. I have been listening to the contribution of the hon. Member for Harborough with some interest, but it appears to me that we are straying very wide of the subject under consideration. The deliberations of the Home Affairs Committee—of which I was a member—although important are not relevant to our current deliberations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we should return to amendment No. 28 and deal with the time-scale rather than debate the whole of the Select Committee's report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garnier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to deal with anything but the relevant part of the evidence given to the Select Committee. If the hon. Lady had contained herself, I would have finished my sentence, which I shall now complete.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
It is the sophistication of those convicted criminals who have access to financial and legal expertise that allows them to create a structure or series of structures that will outlast and outwit the police and others who investigate the existence or otherwise of the proceeds beyond the six-year period set out in the Bill. Given the nature of those criminals, the crimes that they commit, and the planning that they put into their enterprises before committing the crimes and before they are convicted—if they are that unfortunate—it seems to be only good sense and just to enable the courts to look back further than six years. After the criminal has been convicted, it should be possible to examine his activities over a 10-year period.<br><br>
Some people will abscond—we all know of cases where convicts have escaped—and some will die, but their dependants may still benefit from the proceeds of their criminal activities. It would be unfortunate if the beneficiaries of criminal proceeds were allowed to continue to benefit simply because the police or other investigative authorities had been unable to get to the root of the problem within six years of the conviction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have not yet called the hon. Gentleman. I must point out that I have not yet proposed the question. We shall be able to debate this subject for as long as hon. Members want, but it would be courteous to allow the Chairman to propose the question.<br><br>
I have still not called the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, North. I call the hon. Member for Harborough. If he wishes to give way to the hon. Gentleman, that is up to him.</span></p>

If my hon. Friends the Members for Hertfordshire, North or for Exeter would then like to add their comments, I am sure that that would be for the benefit of the Committee.<br><br>
Despite the strictures of the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green, it is important to remember that my amendment is not just a whimsical, technical one; it is a serious and important one, bearing in mind the nature of the people we are tackling.<br><br>

The police officers who gave evidence to the Home Affairs Committee mentioned many activities in which organised criminals in the country and abroad become engaged. The list included drugs, money laundering, gaming, fraud, motor vehicle crimes, forgery, drug related violence, terrorism, organised crime, armed robbery and burglary. Such people are amassing huge amounts of money. We have heard that up to £4 billion is laundered through the City of London, and other sums are laundered through other financial institutions at home and abroad. The Select Committee reached the following general conclusions:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0367">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 59</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"There have been successful prosecutions of organised crime 'figureheads' for offences of importing and supplying drugs, possession of firearms, robbery, fraud, and extortion. The proactive targeting of groups continues to expose the level of sophistication they achieve to avoid detection or to counter undercover police operations.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>While the exploits of notorious 'crime families' have in the past attracted (and others continue to attract) the attention of police and media the penetration by criminals of trade unions, political life and other institutions has been of a relatively low order. Political probity and soundness of professional regulation are significant factors in inhibiting the epidemic proportions of organised crime activity evident in some other countries.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Although obvious, it is important to record the 'pick and mix' approach to organised criminal activity where one criminal enterprise supports another (eg counterfeit passports for drug couriers); or where one "commodity" is bartered for another—vehicles for drugs perhaps. This has important implications for the way in which investigators and enforcers approach the problems."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am following my hon. Friend's arguments with interest, particularly the argument that he has just put forward about criminal gangs in the past. Does he agree that one of the features of gangland history is that, after one or two convictions, a great deal more often comes to light about the full activities of such gangs? What emerges at the time of conviction might not be the full picture. In that context, my hon. Friend's amendments to this and subsequent clauses are valuable because they would enable the courts to consider previous activities dating back further than is currently provided for.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garnier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is why I have tabled the amendments. Let us suppose that a man has been convicted and is in prison or has absconded. Just because he is in prison, he does not necessarily stop running his empire. He can still have runners, or mules, to do his dirty work for him. The proceeds of a criminal enterprise for which he has already been convicted can still continue to amass. I am sorry if I am not making myself clear, but my point is that domestic and international criminal investigation bodies—such as the police, Interpol and Europol—should not be inhibited by the artificial, six-year portcullis. We all know from common sense, from observation and from evidence that we have received from bodies such as the NCIS that the benefits of sophisticated criminal activity continue well beyond a six-year period. I urge my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter to bear in mind the points that I have made. Even if he does not accept the amendment this morning, perhaps he will consider the measure at a later stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest to my hon. Friend, who has made some valuable points. I have put forward brief arguments in Committee for giving the provisions of the Bill the fullest possible ambit and allowing the greatest possible discretion to the courts. That approach needs to be considered very carefully in this case.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend has made clear, clauses 5, 6 and 7 relate to cases in which the court will wish to go back and consider previous determinations—if there have been any—when further information comes to light. The provisions of those clauses will be triggered if the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
prosecutor comes into possession of evidence that would have changed the original view of the court. It would then be decided whether there should be a determination at all, or, under clause 6, what the proceeds of the crime were. Under clause 7, the extent to which the offender benefited from those proceeds would be decided. It is valuable to consider how far back the court should go in that process.<br><br>
When my hon. Friend the Member for Harborough, who supported the amendments, mentioned the sophistication of criminals or gangs and the use of sophisticated criminal techniques, he made a valuable point. Those are the sorts of people who will seek to avoid a determination by concealment, or they will conceal the full amount of the proceeds or the full extent to which they have benefited from their offences. Suppose that a court either did not make a determination or underestimated the proceeds of the offender. If further information came to the prosecutor—perhaps seven years after the determination was made—it would be a shame if he or she were unable to go back to the court to ensure that justice was done, because of the six-year time limit. In that situation, sophisticated offenders might be successful in concealing such matters for that length of time. It would be a shame if prosecutors obtained evidence that criminals had benefited by more than was originally thought, but were prevented from bringing the matter back to court to ensure that justice could be done. That would be a frustration.<br><br>
One might ask: why choose 10 years? Would not the same problem occur if further information came to light after 11 years? That is an obvious point. I think that the time limit should be pushed back as far as possible, so that prosecutors and courts have maximum flexibility. When further matters come to light, and prosecutors bring a matter back to court, the offender would still have the protection that is offered by the safeguards in clause 2. He could still show that he came by a property or made an expenditure in a perfectly legitimate way. He would still have the protection of clause 2(5)(c), which acts as a long stop, as it were, in that the court will not act in a way that could cause injustice to the defendant. As all those safeguards will be available to the defendant, why not push the period back as far as possible, so that courts have as much flexibility as possible? That would remove the risk of sophisticated offenders, to whom my hon. Friend the Member for Harborough referred, getting away scot-free.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With organised crime, the fear that enables the structure to survive means that information does not readily become available to the prosecuting authorities. Occasionally, there is a breakthrough, when a member of a gang—perhaps for his own protection or because he has been caught and feels that he should turn Queen's evidence—gives us the opportunity to unravel the entire structure. The information that becomes available sometimes goes back many years. In that situation, it would be sensible to pull the period back from six to 10 years. That would be a wise move if a supergrass suddenly gave us the opportunity to go back many years, and to ascertain who got the money from various crimes.<br><br>
When the heat is on, armed robbers often leave the country for Spain—possibly not now—or for somewhere
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0368">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 61</span>
in South America where they spend their money until the going gets tough. When the money is gone, or some argument has arisen with another criminal, they limp back to Britain. At that point, the Bill's provisions would enable the prosecutor to serve a statement and start to get answers from those people years after the event. I question whether, in those circumstances, six years is long enough. Often such criminals have left our shores for seven or eight years before they limp home. Ten years may be more appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Hannam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have to make a judgment on the length of time. The amendments would enable the court to revalue defendants' proceeds of crime for a period of up to 10 years after conviction instead of the six that the Bill, as drafted, provides.<br><br>
I think that 10 years would be excessive and could lead to unfairness. Six years would be sufficient to be worth while but not so long as to leave the offender facing an unacceptably long period of uncertainty. It would be much harder for the defendant to rebut the prosecutor's case after a period of 10 years than it would be after six years. We must strike the right balance. A period of six years applies in drug trafficking legislation. During the passage of the Drug Trafficking Act 1994, that aspect was debated at length in the other place.<br><br>
Leaving aside such considerations, however, I point out that a period of six years has been commonly applied in confiscation legislation in other contexts—for example, it is the period applicable to assumptions, under clause 2. Bill and in other confiscation legislation, it is also the ordinary period of limitation that applies to most action in tort and contract law and to actions intended to recover rent arrears or to enforce a judgment. Those examples provide sound precedents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garnier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right that six years is the common period under statute of limitations. In some cases, however, such as those relating to personal injuries legislation and latent damage, that period can be extended. My argument is designed to cater for the latent damage position. On release after six years in prison, an offender could be free to exploit the proceeds of crime. I accept my hon. Friend's arguments that the matter is one of judgment. However, I ask him not to run away entirely from the points that I and my other hon. Friends have made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Hannam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure my hon. Friend that his arguments will be taken into account when we come to a final decision about periods of time or numbers of cases. I accept that we need to examine the matter carefully. The judgment at this stage however, is that the period as specified in the Bill is correct. We can re-examine that judgment, and so I ask members of the Committee to reject the amendments. At this stage I cannot support them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr David Maclean)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intervene briefly to give the Government's view. I have listened carefully to the points made by my hon. Friends and I agree that the right period is a matter of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
judgment. Whether six, seven or 10 years is the relevant period is a moot point. The telling argument is that the proposed legislation would stick out like a sore thumb if it provided a different time span from six years, because drug trafficking legislation and civil tort both provide six years.<br><br>
I respond to my hon. Friend the Member for Harborough by saying that while it is worth considering whether six years is appropriate, we would have to reconsider that in the context of the rest of the Bill and all legislation relating to the confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking. I do not want the Bill to provide a different time scale that provided for drug trafficking. I hope that my hon. Friend will listen to the careful and sensible advice from my hon. Friend the Member Exeter. I have taken on board his points but, at present, I do not want to change the proposed legislation. In light of those assurances, I hope that he will withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Bill is intended to strengthen the law on confiscation generally and bring it in line with that applying to confiscation in the realm of drug trafficking. The Minister is right to say that it is inappropriate to provide a longer period than that specified in other legislations. The official Opposition are persuaded by the arguments of the hon. Member for Exeter. We do not support the amendment.</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garnier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister says that this is a matter of judgment. I have made a judgment that the Committee is against me. I shall not, therefore, press the amendment to a Division. However, I repeat what I implied in innuendo: we cannot run away from this serious issue. I like a good Conservative, favour levelling up rather than down. If other legislation is out of step with my proposal, I suggest that the better judgment is that we amend the earlier legislation and move from six years to eight or 10 years.<br><br>
The arguments advanced by lawyers such as myself is that precedent is king. Precedent is king but it is also susceptible to amendment. From time to time, amendments such as mine meet the public mood. I am a democrat and like to reflect the views of those who elect me and those who I represent, many of whom are very worried about the law-and-order problems that we suffer. However, I am also a democrat in the confines of this Room, and I recognise that I would not win a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Hannam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall take the opportunity to explain what is a complicated and detailed clause, as are clauses 6 and 7. I apologise for that complexity, but the power that is being given to the courts is an important new tool to enable them to deprive a criminal of his ill-gotten gains. Clause 5 further amends the confiscation procedures
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0369">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
under the Criminal Justice Act 1988. It enables a prosecutor to return to a court within six years of an offender's conviction and to apply to that court for leave to consider evidence relating to the offender's benefit from relevant criminal conduct that took place before his sentence.<br><br>
If, on the basis of the new evidence, a court decides to proceed, it may make a confiscation order. The provisions apply where the prosecutor did not give written notice under clause 1 in the original proceedings that he considered it appropriate for the court to make a confiscation order, and where the court did not proceed to make a confiscation order of its own volition in those proceedings. The thinking behind clause 5 is that as a rule, where the prosecutor does not tender notice at the time of the original trial and the court does not proceed of its own volition, the reason will have been that the defendant appeared to have derived little or no benefit from crime.<br><br>
In reality, as we have been discussing, the benefit may have been considerable and may have been effectively concealed from the authorities until the original proceedings were over. The present provisions reward defendants for their skill in laundering proceeds, as my hon. Friend the Member for Harborough explained. The purpose of the provisions before us is to enable the defendant's benefit from his criminal conduct that has taken place before sentence to be revisited by the court. I stress that clause 5 catches only the benefit from crimes committed before the defendant's original sentence. There is no question of confiscating the proceeds of other relevant criminal conduct that might have taken place after sentence.<br><br>
I should say, in parenthesis, that I am asked repeatedly whether the Bill would cover some of the proceeds that criminals have accruing to them from large amounts paid by the media for articles about their crimes. They would be covered only if a contract had been agreed before conviction. Otherwise, they would still be able to make further gains from the media, which I would very much regret.<br><br>
For that reason, the courts are allowed to take into account payments and rewards received by a defendant after sentencing, but only to the extent that they represent benefit from relevant criminal conduct by a defendant before that date. Safeguards are built into the provisions. An application may be entertained only within six years of a defendant's conviction. Clearly, it would be unreasonable to allow the courts an indefinite power to revisit the benefit from previous offending. The period of six years strikes a reasonable balance between the interests of a defendant and of confiscation, and features in civil law and elsewhere in confiscation legislation. The clause will enable the courts to confiscate the full amount of a defendant's benefit.</span></p>

<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
ENFORCEMENT ETC. OF CONFISCATION ORDERS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Hannam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 8 has two main purposes. It aims to prevent defendants from avoiding payment of their confiscation orders by serving a term of imprisonment in default—an important aspect of the Bill. It also enables restraint and charging orders to be made in connection with the new revaluation provisions in clauses 5 to 7.<br><br>
I shall deal first with imprisonment in default. As the law stands, confiscation orders under the Criminal Justice Act 1988 are enforced substantially like fines. They may be expunged by the service of a term of imprisonment in default. There is evidence that a significant number of confiscation orders under drug trafficking legislation have been written off in that way. In the year 1993–94, the amount written off was about a tenth of the total amount realised. In some cases, a confiscation order may be enforced by the early appointment of a receiver before the defendant has had the opportunity to embark on a default term. However, that is likely to be a practical method of enforcement only where a substantial order is involved and, in particular, when the defendant is serving a long sentence of imprisonment. What happens in practice is that the defendant can choose between paying a confiscation order and serving a term in default of payment. The purpose of confiscation is to deprive criminals of the proceeds of crime—forcibly, if necessary—by appointing a receiver. The present provisions seem to run contrary to the general purpose of the legislation. Clause 8 helps to close that loophole.<br><br>
The provisions relating to restraint and charging orders are technical, but their purpose is simple. They ensure that property can be frozen so that it is available for enforcement when a confiscation order is made or revalued under the provisions of clauses 5 to 7. The idea behind clause 8 is that there is no point giving courts powers to make confiscation orders unless property can be frozen at an early stage to prevent its dissipation. It is all too easy for property to be disposed of to avoid handing it over. Under part VI of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, the court can make a restraint order and a charging order when, or just before, proceedings are instituted. Clause 8 extends that power to applications under clauses 5 to 7. The High Court will be able to make a restraint order and a charging order where the prosecutor has made or is to make an application under those clauses. I expect clause 8 to improve confiscation order realisation under the 1988 Act. It will provide essential support to the new revaluation provisions in clauses 5 to 7.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garnier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I commend the clause, because it does away with the myth that has been allowed to grow up in some circles that people who commit a crime and then pay a fine have, as it were, bought absolution. It is almost as though there is a contract with society that if I commit a burglary or another serious criminal offence and spend 10 years in prison the contract is clean, there has been an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0370">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 65</span>
equal exchange of goods and services from one party to the other and the consideration has been the payment of a fine or the period spent in prison. That is philosophically flawed and I am happy that the Bill will make it plain that there is no such thing as buying one's way out of society's condemnation for criminal conduct.<br><br>
At last, Parliament is addressing the problem that criminals have been able to cock a snook at the law-abiding members of society, at the administration of justice and at all the other criminals who are foolish enough not to have amassed enough money to pay off the time that they have spent in prison. At last, criminals who amass proceeds from crime will have those proceeds confiscated and will not be able to hang on to them by agreeing, as it were, to pay a little more by spending two or three more years in prison. When millions of pounds are involved, spending another two or three years in prison for failing to pay under a confiscation order is nothing—it is a pretty good rent to pay. I am delighted that my hon. Friend's Bill will at last deal with that problem. It is with a fair wind that I blow the clause towards fruition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maclean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government consider clause 8 to be one of the most important clauses in the Bill. I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter has drafted it so toughly that not even my other hon. Friends can find amendments to table to toughen it still further. My hon. Friend has once again perceived a considerable gap in the present law in relation to the generality of crime. The Government give the clause our full support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be extremely brief, but, I hope, to the point. There is complete agreement in the Committee on the matter. It is clear that there are very many lifestyle criminals who are quite happy to spend a certain amount of time in prison in exchange for the ill-gotten gains that they have built up before their term of imprisonment. I congratulate the hon. Member for Exeter on including the clause in the Bill. We hope that, when enacted, it will have the desired result. My constituents—and, I am sure, those of all hon. Members—fully agree with the clause.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In examining the reasons behind the amendments, it is right to begin by mentioning that amendments Nos. 11 to 18 and 20 deal with clause 11 and amendments Nos. 24, 25 and 26 refer to clause 12.<br><br>
The amendments are designed to allow us to question whether the orders for production under clause 11 and the powers of search and seizure under clause 12 should be exercised by the Crown court and circuit judge or by magistrates. It is an important principle, in my view, that the magistrates court should be the body that deals with the investigative process and the assistance of the police in exercising that function. Magistrates have had powers to aid the investigation of crime since the 14th century.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
In the 14th century, magistrates were given commissions to keep the peace, inquire into, hear and determine the crimes that were listed in the commission. The eminent historian, Mr. Gleason said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The justices of the peace symbolize the polity of England. Official but not professional, autonomous and powerful yet limited and directed, they have long served their land in unmatched fashion. Commissioned first in the fourteenth century to give a greater degree of order to a feudalistic society, after the Restoration they became the unchallenged rulers of their counties, and they remain important today in local criminal jurisdiction despite the development of the bureaucratic state."</p></blockquote>
I believe that that is as true today as it was in the 14th century.<br><br>
The policing role of the magistrates ended in the 19th
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0371">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 67</span>
century, but, even today, magistrates have important powers to aid the investigation of crime. Those powers are analagous to those in clauses 11 and 12 of the Bill. Under a series of Acts of Parliament, magistrates have the power to order that a constable may enter premises to search and to seize items therein.<br><br>
I have four examples. Under the Lotteries and Amusements Act 1976, when there are reasonable grounds for suspicion of an offence—perhaps running a lottery for personal gain—the magistrates have the power to issue a warrant authorising a constable to enter the premises, search them and seize items. That power applies to something that may not have the full smack of crime, but it is an offence under the Lotteries and Amusements Act 1976.<br><br>
Some of the most serious offences involve firearms. Under the Firearms Act 1968, magistrates have the power on reasonable suspicion to grant a search warrant authorising a constable to enter the premises, seize and detain firearms and examine books if the matter involves a registered firearms dealer.<br><br>
Moving up the scale of offences even further, I refer to the Biological Weapons Act 1974. If there are reasonable grounds for suspicion that an offence of developing, producing, stockpiling, acquiring or retaining a biological weapon has been committed, magistrates have the power to enable a constable to enter the premises to inspect documents, to seize and detain equipment and to take samples and detain substances.<br><br>
Probably the best known example is the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. For some of the most troubling crime in our society, magistrates have powers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has mentioned some good examples of the important powers of magistrates. May I add another—the widespread powers given to magistrates under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. It is, of course, magistrates who issue search warrants and orders for production under that Act, which places many other duties on magistrates. The question, which my hon. Friend rightly asks, is: if the magistrates can be trusted to deal with those matters, why can they not issue warrants under the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has encapsulated about half of my speech in that short intervention. I shall not deal specifically with the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. However, section 97 of the Magistrates' Court Act 1980 gives magistrates the power to require the attendance of a witness to give material evidence or to produce any document or other evidence likely to be material. The wording of the Act is pertinent. Section 97 (1) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where a justice of the peace … is satisfied that any person in England or Wales is likely to be able to give material evidence, or produce any document or thing likely to be material evidence"—</p></blockquote>
the Act next deals with the sorts of courts in which that applies—
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"and that person will not voluntarily attend as a witness, or will not voluntarily produce the document or thing, the justice shall issue a summons directed to that person requiring him to attend before the court … to give evidence or to produce the document".</p></blockquote>
Subsection (2) states that
<br><blockquote><p>"If a justice of the peace is satisfied by evidence on oath of the matters mentioned in subsection (1) above, and also that it is probable that a summons … would not procure the attendance of the person in question, the justice may instead of issuing a summons issue a warrant to arrest that person and bring him before such a court".</p></blockquote>
The magistrates have powers under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and under numerous other statutes that give them power to issue warrants for entry and search and seizure. Those powers are similar to those given under clauses 11 and 12 of the Bill. For example, the question whether there are reasonable grounds for suspicion or certain necessary preconditions for the grant of a search warrant or an entry warrant is similar to that found in clause 11(4). The conditions for the granting of an order for production given in subsection (4) are:
<ol>
<li>"(a) that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that a specified person has benefited from any criminal conduct;</li>
<li>(b) that there are reasonable ground for suspecting that the material to which the application relates … is likely to be of substantial value … and does not consist of … items subject to legal privilege or excluded material".</li></ol>
That question—whether there are reasonable grounds for suspicion—is asked by magistrates every day of the week under a range of powers. I believe that they would be quite capable of fulfilling such a duty under clause 11. The materiality of evidence that has to be considered by magistrates under section 97 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 is a similar exercise to that required by clause 11(4)(b), under which judges have to consider whether there are reasonable grounds for suspicion and whether the material is
<br><blockquote><p>"likely to be of substantial value … to the investigation".</p></blockquote>
In deciding whether a piece of evidence or a document is material under section 97 of the 1980 Act, the magistrates are exercising a similar function to that described in clause 11(4)(b). The wording may be different, but the exercise is similar.<br><br>
Clause 11(4)(c) deals with the public interest. It is not only necessary that there should be reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person had benefited from criminal conduct and that the material is of substantial value and is not privileged. In addition, there should be
<br><blockquote><p>"reasonable grounds for believing that it is in the public interest".</p></blockquote>
Account must also be taken of the likely benefit to the investigation—which, again, relates to the issue of materiality—and of
<br><blockquote><p>"the circumstances under which the person in possession of the material holds it".</p></blockquote>
Magistrates are in a unique position because they are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0372">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
members of the public—I have given a description of them from the leading text—and they are able to bring almost a flavour of a jury to the question of public interest, which a judge on his own cannot. In deciding cases, magistrates are the judges of the facts and the law, but they take the law from the justices' clerk. In our system, their role is partly that of a jury. They bring to that role three experiences of life and three sets of knowledge in a way that a professional judge on his own cannot. There is much to be said for magistrates rather than the judge being involved in the decision as to whether the production of certain documents is in the public interest, under the test specified in new section 93H(4)(c). It may be said that such decisions are too difficult for magistrates, but they already deal with serious issues on evidence and procedure at a committal hearing and the issues set out in the clause are no more difficult.<br><br>
The powers that I have already outlined deal with some of the most serious offences—biological weapons, firearms and serious drug cases—which may involve terrorists as well as armed criminals. Legal advice is available to the magistrates through the magistrates' clerks, who over recent years have developed their training and expertise to a high level. Magistrates also commonly deal with the investigative process, assisting the police by granting search warrants and rights of entry and dealing with the matters to which we already referred.<br><br>
Daily involvement with such issues gives them an expertise which a circuit judge does not have. Of course, nobody would deny that a circuit judge has his own expertise and skills, but there is a good deal to be said for allowing magistrates to deal with this particular issue.<br><br>
I should also like to mention two other issues. The first is convenience. The police are used to applying to magistrates for warrants. There are, inevitably, more magistrates courts in the country than there are Crown courts, they are open more often and are frequently nearer. In East Anglia, for example, a serious criminal case from Cambridge would be dealt with in Norwich, which is 70 miles away. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter and the Minister consider it necessary for the police, the criminals and the lawyers to travel the 70 miles from Cambridge to Norwich to deal with the matter, but I question why, particularly bearing in mind the points which I have already—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maclean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept my hon. Friend's argument about convenience—although I do not accept his other argument—but it is undermined by the fact that we do not intend the police to have to make such journeys 20 or 200 times a day. It will not be a habitual occurrence. It will not be rare for the police to require a warrant for the production of documents or to look into bank accounts in the most serious cases, but it will not be an undue inconvenience.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that it is impossible to say how many more cases there will be. Under the heading "Financial, Compliance and Manpower Effects", the Bill estimates that Customs and Excise would have an extra 30
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
cases each year, which would give rise to a cost of £164,000. An estimate does not seem to have been made of the number of extra cases generally. The reason for the Bill is that we want the courts to do that more often. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere knows, some people have pages of criminal convictions. My hon. Friend said only the other day that 7 per cent. of those convicted represent 62 per cent. of the offences for which convictions are recorded.<br><br>
The procedure could be used against a substantial body of people and I do not see why the police, lawyers and even criminals should have to travel vast distances to the nearest Crown court when the matter could be dealt with at a local magistrates court. It is not the most difficult issue in the world to decide whether someone should be required to produce documents or whether a search warrant should be issued. If magistrates can deal with the most serious cases prior to conviction, I do not understand why they cannot deal with them post conviction. I shall be interested to hear my hon. Friend's views and to consider his arguments.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
Finally, I turn to subsidiarity. In the court system, as in government, applications should be dealt with at the most appropriate level. I question why the Crown court should be chosen for interlocutory applications when magistrates, who are the backbone of England and have the expertise, could do the job equally well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garnier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to express my fundamental disagreement with the arguments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North. I may be biased because for the past 20 years I have practised in the High Court and not in magistrates courts and therefore have less proximate fond memories of those courts than my hon. Friend. The issues which the court—be it a magistrates court, a circuit county court judge or even a High Court judge—will have to deal with under clause 11 are complicated and not best dealt with by a bench of lay magistrates.<br><br>
There may have been some force in my hon. Friend's amendment had he restricted the changes to a stipendiary magistrate—that is, a legally qualified magistrate. My experience of magistrates courts is that they are very good at what they do at present—assessing evidence of guilt or innocence of the crimes that come before them. The bulk of criminal cases in this country—approximately 80 per cent.—are tried by magistrates. They are straightforward "Did he do it, did he not do it?" or "Did she do it, did she not do it?" cases; they are not the sort of complicated fraud cases that are heard at the Old Bailey and other High court criminal centres.<br><br>
I am sure that magistrates would be willing to hear such cases but they are already overburdened with work. It is difficult now to get magistrates to volunteer for selection by the Lord Chancellor and if we were to impose yet further burdens on them, there would be a tailing off in the number of volunteers coming forward to sit as lay magistrates.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0373">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
I do not wish to cast aspersions on the qualities of the clerks who advise lay magistrates, but the calibre of their advice is not sufficiently specialised to enable them to advise magistrates clearly on how to disentangle what is right and what is wrong and what is proper in investigations covered by clause 11.<br><br>
Justice is not always served by convenience. It is predominantly concerned with justice. Having to go from Cambridge to Norwich to obtain justice is not a denial of justice; it is merely a geographical inconvenience, which should not weigh heavily on the mind of my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter when he responds to my hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North.<br><br>
I mentioned stipendary magistrates earlier with some diffidence because the last thing that they want is to become involved in the investigations that we are discussing.<br><br>
Judges who are trained in Chancery work—many circuit judges are from the Chancery Bar or have had solicitors' practices that dealt with tracing and so on—have the relevant training and experience to disentangle the matters that clause 11 involves. I therefore urge my hon. Friends, who have listened politely to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North, to put aside his suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to the debate on the amendment.<br><br>
I must return to a theme that I developed earlier—that of giving maximum flexibility and trust to our courts. As I said during our previous sitting, we train people to be judges, and we appoint responsible people as magistrates. We should therefore show them a bit of trust when the discharge of the law is involved. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North gave a good and full list of the duties and responsibilities that magistrates courts carry out in our legal system, but I have one reservation about his argument, which I shall come to presently. He could have added another point to his list: a clause that we debated earlier will give magistrates courts the responsibility of determining whether to make an order. We give magistrates that responsibility, and when a prosecutor has given them written notice, that of determining whether a benefit has been received or whether to embark upon such a course of their own volition. They have the responsibility to make a determination. It is something of an anomaly that they have those responsibilities when we cannot trust them with making an investigation or with helping the police to determine whether any proceeds of crime are involved.<br><br>
I suspect that the reason for the involvement of circuit judges in such matters goes back to what I believe to be the origins of clauses 11 and 12, which is the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. I shall discuss that matter later, but I should like to foreshadow that with a brief point. Clause 11(4)(c) provides the public interest test. Although that test involves the public interest, magistrates are perfectly capable of dealing with the matter
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
themselves. One of the leading authorities on the public interest test is in the Crown court of Lewes, which considered the case of ex parte Hill. That court considered the test in relation to the provisions of PACE, the test comes from the special procedure provisions of PACE, which relate to matters that come within the realm of confidential information and records. The test is said to involve the determination of
<br><blockquote><p>"first of all, a public interest in the effective investigation and prosecution of crime. Secondly, there is a public interest in protecting the personal property rights of citizens against infringement and invasion."</p></blockquote>
There does not seem to be a great deal of mystery about that. Magistrates are perfectly capable of determining such matters.<br><br>
I do not think that clause 11(4)(c) should be in the Bill. It is unnecessarily restrictive and it places too much of a hurdle in the way of the police and prosecutors in the investigation of offences. It has been, I think, lifted directly from the special procedures of PACE, which relate to the searching of premises. It should not be in the Bill because the police should be given greater flexibility than the paragraph will allow them. Of course, we should not be dealing in every case with confidential information. I shall return to that matter later. I raise it at present because I think that magistrates are perfectly capable of dealing with the test and with all of the other matters that appear in clause 11.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Greenway <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ryedale)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no wish to detain the Committee and I shall be brief. You, Mr. Hill, have been gracious enough to include new clause 1 on the selection list. Were the clause to be incorporated in the Bill, it would have a bearing on the points made by my hon. Friends this morning because among offences that could be subject to confiscation orders for the proceeds of crime—cash that has been earned from crime—would be several offences relating to pirate videos and cassettes. Some such offences are triable only summarily—they would be dealt with by magistrates courts and probably not by Crown courts.<br><br>
We should reflect on the serious point that my hon. Friends have raised. Would it be unduly restrictive to require a circuit judge to grant approval and issue warrants for searching for material relating to matters where any trial would be before a magistrates court, not a Crown court? My hon. Friend the Member for Exeter and my hon. Friend the Minister may want to reflect on that genuine concern. It is hypothetical because, as yet, new clause 1 has not been accepted. However, were it to be accepted and the wording of clause 11 to remain the same, the progress of such prosecutions and the confiscation of proceeds of crime relating to those offences could be restricted. When I speak later to new clause 1 I shall mention the vast quantities of video material that is already being seized and the even greater quantity that we believe is still to be seized. It is important that the police have flexibility to act quickly before that material disappears. We may need to reconsider this crucial point in the light of what happens to new clause 1.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Sir John Hannam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should declare an interest as my wife is a magistrate. I know that she would react strongly to further impositions or burdens on the magistrates courts. We heard a good presentation of the prosecution and defence from my hon. Friends the Members for Hertfordshire, North and for Harborough. However, the effect of the amendments—which would allow magistrates courts, not circuit judges, to make production orders and issue search warrants—is not what I would wish to be included in the Bill.<br><br>
The powers in clauses 11 and 12 are designed to enable enforcement agencies to gain access to the so-called special procedure material, which includes records held on a confidential basis by banks, accountants and solicitors. That power, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere mentioned, comes from the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, where it is given to a circuit judge, not a magistrates court. The Bill is, therefore, consistent. I accept that where material has been held on the basis of confidentiality and access to it necessarily involves an intrusion into obligations of confidentiality, it has long been accepted that powers to override those obligations should be entrusted to a suitably high level of judicial authority. In my opinion, that authority should be a circuit judge. A limited number of serious matters is involved and it is right that such matters should be dealt with by the circuit judge, not the magistrates court.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere referred to the magistrates courts. They will be able to operate clause 2 only in respect of offences under schedule 4. Such offences are expected to be few and cases will be closely guided by the prosecutor and the financial statement. I cannot support the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garnier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want only to add power to the elbow of my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter. He mentioned the Police and Criminal Evidence Act and the need for applicants to go before a circuit judge to gain access to special procedure material. It may be of help if I tell my hon. Friend that I have acted several times for television companies which were respondents to application by the police to obtain unbroadcast film of riots—I am referring to the Wapping and Strangeways riots which ITN and other companies filmed but which broadcast only part of the footage. The police wanted to obtain evidence to determine whether criminal offences had been committed.<br><br>
I assure my hon. Friend that his arguments are valid: circuit judges are well able to distinguish a good point from a bad point. In every case in which I acted for a respondent, I was unsuccessful in resisting applications by the police and the prosecuting authorities under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. My hon. Friend should not be worried that giving the powers to the circuit judges and not to the magistrates will inhibit the police in any way.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Hannam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend. The proposal was intended to create more flexibility and to quicken the process. We have heard enough evidence to recognise that we are dealing with a few very important
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 74</span>
cases and that delays would occur if magistrates courts were presented with requests for orders. Circuit judges are more able and better equipped to sort out the pros and cons of an individual application and to make a decision.<br><br>
I therefore hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North will withdraw the amendment. He and other hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale (Mr. J. Greenway), have raised important points to which we shall return later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maclean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government support the views expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter. As time is pressing, I shall say only that the amendments would allow production orders and search warrants to be made and issued in investigations into benefit from crime at a lower level of judicial authority than is required in investigations into serious arrestable offences such as drug trafficking and terrorism. That is not right and therefore the Government cannot support the amendments of my hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the arguments, and I perceive the force of the point that given the provision under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, it might create uncertainty if a different provision were to be included in the Bill. On that ground, and given that I would not win a vote, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 19, in page 17, line 23, leave out from 'made' to end of line 23 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'on notice to the magistrates' court'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 21, in page 17, line 28, at end insert—
<ul>
<li>'(c) the minimum notice required under subsection (6) above.'.</li></ul></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall take the amendments shortly. Amendments Nos. 19 and 21 are designed to ensure that a hearing inter parte takes place, rather than an ex parte hearing, so that all those concerned, including third parties and defendants, are represented when orders for the production of documents are being dealt with.<br><br>
Clause 12 deals with an entirely different situation. Where powers of search and seizure are required in cases where it is not practicable to communicate with the third party, or where there is a risk that documents may not reach the prosecution if the power of search and seizure is not employed, I accept that the application should be made ex parte.<br><br>
In cases where documents are to be produced, however, I see no reason why a hearing should not take place in which all parties are entitled to present their point of view.<br><br>
Such hearings are especially important because of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0375">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 75</span>
question of public interest, which is set out in subsection (4)(c). The hon. Member for Harborough told the Committee about his representing respondents and putting their point of view as to whether television films should be released to the prosecution. That type of hearing should be provided for in the clause and should not just be a matter of the prosecution attending on the judge in chambers, putting its point of view and ending the matter there.<br><br>
The civil courts deal regularly with the matter in Anton Piller orders which give a right of entry and search and seizure of documents in civil cases. Those courts have held that only on rare occasions should applications be granted for ex parte and only in circumstances analogous to those in clause 12, where the power of search and seizure is necessary. The notes to the White Book state that there should be
<br><blockquote><p>"an extremely strong prima facie case … a real possibility that he"—</p></blockquote>
the defendant—
<br><blockquote><p>"may destroy such material before an application"</p></blockquote>
should be granted ex parte.<br><br>
The court is zealous not to make Anton Piller orders too freely. An ex parte order is justified only when there is a paramount need to prevent a denial of justice which cannot be met by an order for the delivery up of documents following an inter partes hearing. I could say more but, in brief, that is the reason for the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Hannam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The effect of amendment No. 19 would be to require application for a production order to be made on notice to the magistrates court. The new power to make rules of court, proposed in amendment No.21, hangs on amendment No.19. Giving notice in the way proposed would mean that applications for production orders would be inter partes—that is between the police or the customs officer applying for the production of the material and the person or institution in possession of it. As a result, production orders could be contested before they have been made. Drug trafficking legislation, however, has been amended recently by section 24(5) of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 to make it clear that applications for drug trafficking production orders may be made ex parte. In light of those factors, I cannot support the amendment and I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North will withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have again considered the inconsistency of legislation that covers broadly the same area and it is therefore right to withdraw the amendment. However, I strongly believe that where possible, hearings should be inter partes. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 23, in page 17, line 46, leave out paragraph (b)</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
discuss amendment No.27, in Clause 13, page 21, line 41, leave out subsection (10)</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The provision in new subsection (10)(b) will mean that an order made under new subsection (2), concerning the production of documents,
<br><blockquote><p>"shall have effect notwithstanding any obligation as to secrecy or other restriction upon the disclosure of information imposed by statute or otherwise".</p></blockquote>
My amendment would delete that. New subsection (10) in clause 13 makes a similar provision which I also want to delete.<br><br>
I am worried that the provisions will mean that documents might be required to be made available that had been produced initially in circumstances of confidentiality. I fully accept that a bank or other financial institution always has a contractual relationship of confidentiality and it would be right to breach that obligation in order to make available information about the assets and expenditure of a defendant. However, I am worried that, with regard to other information, perhaps provided by informers in circumstances of confidentiality, the issue might be more finely balanced. The amendments are probing amendments to deal with that issue.<br><br>
If an informer within a company were to give confidential information to the executives and higher management about acts of dishonesty by an individual—the convicted person for the purposes of the Bill—with the result that the convicted person was dismissed, there would probably be documents revealing financial irregularities and perhaps even assets obtained by the convicted person. The company would be placed in a difficult position by an application under clause 11 because it would have promised the individual who provided the information that it would be kept confidential and that his position would be protected. I am worried that, if an application was to proceed on the basis of new subsection (10)(b), the informer's confidentiality might not be respected and his rights might not be property represented, especially if there were ex parte applications.<br><br>
There are often hearings involving children, in which social services, the court welfare officer, adoption agencies or the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children may have confidential information about the assets and expenditure of a convicted person. Those bodies could have gleaned all sorts of information on a confidential basis that shows that the convicted person is a criminal and is unsuitable to look after children. But the person who gave the information—the neighbour, relative or cousin—may have done so on the basis that, in the interests of the children, it was vital that the information should be disclosed in circumstances of confidentiality, but that he or she did not want the information to be revealed to the police or in court where the defendant may have an opportunity to discover its source.<br><br>
Another possible scenario is where a child, who has information about the means of his father, who is a convicted person, applies for a student loan on a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0376">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 77</span>
confidential basis. That situation may be more finely balanced than the first two that I described. Similarly, with the Child Support Agency, information is given under a statutory protection of confidentiality by an absent or custodial parent, who makes allegations about the financial circumstances of the other party in a context different from that of a criminal investigation.<br><br>
About 182 statutes and 100 statutory instruments prohibit the disclosure of official information. I have not had the opportunity to study each and every one of them and the Committee will be relieved to hear that I shall not go through them all now, but to give the Committee a sample, they include the Consumer Credit Acts, all the Acts dealing with gas, electricity and telephones, the Data Protection Act 1984, the Employment Agencies Act 1973, the Adoption Acts and the council tax legislation. Has my hon. Friend fully considered all those issues, and is he satisfied that there is no danger in allowing such orders to be made ex parte, superseding any obligations to secrecy or restriction on the disclosure of information imposed by any of those 182 statutes and 100 statutory instruments?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is persuading me to look at new section 93H(4)(c) in a different light. I have listened carefully to the important arguments that he has been developing. Does he believe that subsection (4)(c), would act as a safeguard in the sort of cases that he described? I think that he is saying that even though that safeguard exists, that sort of information should not be disclosed.</span></p>
<p>12.45pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was just about to say that that protection exists, especially in subsection (4)(c)(ii). The court will have to have reasonable grounds for believing that it is in the public interest to produce the information, having regard
<br><blockquote><p>"to the circumstances under which the person in possession of the material holds it, that the material should be produced"</p></blockquote>
Given that the applications will be made ex parte, I am worried that there will not be an opportunity for the third party to explain what the reasons and circumstances might be. Judges are extremely good at dealing with such issues, but they will not necessarily know the full circumstances if they are not provided with them. They would be if the applications were dealt with on notice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Hannam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to my hon. Friend's reasons for tabling the amendments, but I am not persuaded that it would be sensible to amend the Bill in that way.<br><br>
I shall deal with each amendment separately. The main purpose of clause 11 is to enable material to be obtained to assist in a financial investigation. The material will normally be held on a confidential basis, and more often than not it will be in the possession of a financial institution which has a duty of confidentiality to its customers. To ensure that the provisions work effectively,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
clause 11 necessarily provides that a production order
<br><blockquote><p>"shall have effect notwithstanding any obligation as to secrecy or other restriction upon the disclosure of information imposed by statute or otherwise".</p></blockquote>
But for that provision an accountant, a bank, or other person or body in possession of material could refuse to comply with an order on the ground that to do so would constitute a breach of confidentiality, which would frustrate the purpose of the measure.<br><br>
The purpose of clause 13 is to enable a prosecutor to apply to the High court for the production of material by a Government Department in order to facilitate the restraining, charging or realisation of property under part VI of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North will have seen from new section 93J(7) in clause 13 that the court cannot make such an order unless
<br><blockquote><p>"a reasonable opportunity has been given for an officer of the department to make representations to the court and … it appears to the court that the material is likely to be of substantial value in exercising functions relating to the investigation of crime."</p></blockquote>
Much of the information that is held by Government Departments cannot be further disclosed because of restrictions imposed on that Department by legislation. Moreover, the information may be classified as confidential or secret. The purpose of the provision, which is to gain more information in specified circumstances about the defendant's property would clearly be thwarted if, in response to an application by the prosecutor, the Department could decline to comply with the court order because the information was protected in some way. That would be most unsatisfactory and the provision puts the onus on the court to decide, in the light of representations that are made, whether it would be appropriate for the information to be made available to the prosecutor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that under clause 13 the position is much happier than under clause 11. However, under clause 13, will a Government Department have a duty to at least present the facts and make the argument for the third party, who may have provided information confidentially? Or, will it be entirely up to a Government Department to decide what view to take? What will be the Government Department's policy in such circumstances?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Hannam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall obviously come back to my hon. Friend on that point because it needs clarification and is an important area for consideration. I promise to come back to him. I hope, however, that having heard my explanation of the need for the Bill's provisions, he will be prepared to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maclean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is my responsibility to clarify the matter; if I cannot do so now, I shall certainly write to my hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North. The general rule is that if information is supplied to a Government Department confidentially, the Department invariably respects the confidentiality of the supplier of the information. Before lifting that confidentiality, we would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0377">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 79</span>
ask the person who supplied the information if he or she objected to the information being made public or revealed to whoever has inquired about it. That is the general policy rule. Having said that, I shall write to my hon. Friend concerning how that may be affected by his specific point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to both of my hon. Friends for their responses. Perhaps when writing to me my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter will consider the open government White Paper, which at annex B lists the various statutes that deal with the prohibition of disclosure of Government information, in case he foresees difficulties with any of them. On the basis of the assurances that I have been given, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Sir John Hannam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall briefly describe the powers that are given under clause 12. They build on the powers conferred by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 at schedule 1 and by the Drug Trafficking Offences Act of 1986, as consolidated in the Drug Trafficking Act 1994. The clause will enable the enforcement agencies—the police and the customs—to obtain a warrant to search premises and seize material for the purposes of a financial investigation. Like the production order powers in clause 11, the new powers in clause 12 will bite at an earlier stage in an investigation than those in schedule 1 to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. Like clause 11, the clause will provide enhanced existing asset-tracing powers and improve on those currently available in respect of crime generally. I think that they will receive general support.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Sir John Hannam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise that it was not possible to include new clause 2 and the associated amendments in the Bill when it was introduced. Members of the Committee will appreciate that I have kept in close touch with my hon. Friend the Minister concerning the amendments and I can assure the Committee that it is important, for the reasons that I shall explain, that the opportunity provided by consideration in Committee should be taken to clarify a somewhat technical matter that has come to light in respect of our powers of restraint on behalf of other countries.<br><br>
New clause 2 would amend paragraphs 10, 20 and 30 of schedule 4 to the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989, and section 9 of the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990. The amendments would make it clear that the new clause is to come into effect on Royal Assent being given and that it will apply throughout the United Kingdom. The background is as follows.<br><br>
Schedule 4 to the prevention of terrorism Act 1989 enables an Order in Council to made for the enforcement of external orders for the restraint and forfeiture of terrorist funds. That differs from the scheme applicable to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0378">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 81</span>
enforcement of external drug trafficking and all crime confiscation orders in one important respect. Under terrorism legislation, property is frozen in this country by the enforcement of an external restraint order. Under drug trafficking and other crime provisions, the prosecutors must apply for a domestic restraint order to the High Court.<br><br>
Although the terrorism provisions for enforcing external restraint orders are an effective means of freezing property in the United Kingdom, it has become apparent that circumstances may arise in which it would be useful to have a power to apply to the High Court for a domestic restraint order. I think particularly of the early stages in a case where there was then no external restraint order but where it was desirable for the authorities to freeze property here, perhaps even before proceedings were instituted. Alternatively, the external restraint order may in some cases have to be served on those affected by it as soon as it is made abroad. Under those circumstances, the possible dissipation of the funds is obvious; but that could be forestalled by a timely application for a domestic restraint order. Under new clause 2, it would be possible to make such an order, as it already is possible in drug trafficking and all other crime legislation.<br><br>
There is also doubt about whether it is possible at present to obtain a domestic restraint order at an early stage, in anticipation of an external forfeiture order generally—that is, an order for the destruction or other disposal of items used or intended to be used to commit offences. New clause 2 therefore also amends section 9 of the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990 to make that possible.<br><br>
The provisions will provide more flexible powers for enforcing external forfeiture orders. I commend them to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maclean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members may recall that I signalled the Government's intention to amend the prevention of terrorism Act, in the manner proposed in new clause 2, during the recent debate on the principle Order in Council on schedule 4 to that Act. I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter for those amendments. Their inclusion in his Bill will enable them to be brought
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 82</span>
into force much sooner than would otherwise have been possible.<br><br>
The amendments to the prevention of terrorism Act will enable a domestic restraint order to be obtained at an early stage when terrorism proceedings in another jurisdiction have already begun or are about to begin and where no external restraint order has yet been made. That will add greater flexibility to our power to restrain assets in this country on behalf of other jurisdictions. It is to be welcomed.<br><br>
Whereas schedule 4 to the prevention of terrorism Act enables the enforcement in this country of external orders for the forfeiture of terrorist funds, the 1990 Act enables external forfeiture orders generally to be enforced here. The relationship between the two Acts is obvious, but it has become apparent during work on terrorism legislation that there is some doubt about the extent of the powers to restrain assets conferred by section 9 of the 1990 Act. The amendment rectifies matters. As a result, new clause 2 and its associated amendments have the Government's full support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Exeter. In his opening remarks, he identified a possible problem. Capital money or assets that are the product of terrorist crime may be used in this country, but it might be difficult to do anything about it because of the time gap necessary to implement appropriate legislation in the country whence that terrorism originated.<br><br>
I was somewhat surprised that my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport, one of the Bills supporters, was not notified about new clause 2. I appreciate that it appeared on the Order Paper last Thursday as an instruction from the House. It would help if the Home Office would write to all members of the Standing Committee, setting out in detail the background to the new clause and to the appropriate amendments. We are trying to move forward.</span></p>
