<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Charities (Amendment) Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That if proceedings on the Charities (Amendment) Bill are not completed at this day's sitting the Committee do meet on Wednesday 12 July at half-past Ten o'clock.—<i>[Mr. Whitney.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Luff <span class='memberconstituency'>(Worcester)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. In view of the light attendance of Opposition Members, could you inform us what the quorum is for the Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The quorum is five.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Clappison <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hertsmere)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I welcome you to the Chair and apologise for raising a point of order, but I think that it is appropriate to ask about the use of books in Committee. There are rules on reading books in Committee and I want to clarify the position. The Bill is relatively short but, as is often the case with short Bills, it deals with a technical subject that requires much research and a knowledge of particular legal authority. Many hon. Members would find it difficult to get to grips with such a technical subject without the assistance of books. Will it be possible for members of the Committee to refer at length to books so that we might better understand the proceedings?<br><br>
I have received some books by courtesy of the House of Commons Library, but I was told that other hon. Members want to use the same books. As there is a limited supply, would it be possible to pass them around during the debate, provided that that did not disturb the good order of the Committee? I seek your guidance so that the Committee can run efficiently and does not cause you any trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is quite in order to read any documentation, including any in book form—to which the hon. Gentleman specifically referred. It is not in order to quote at length from books, but a quote that is relevant to the amendment and that does not disturb the good order of the Committee would be in order. There is nothing wrong with passing such documentation to a colleague, provided that that does not disturb the good order of the Committee.<br><br>
Before we move to clause 1, I should call attention to the fact that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I be the second to welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Martin? You have been in the Chair before when I have sat on Committees. On those occasions, however, I was constrained by my position as parliamentary private secretary and was unable to make any contribution to the proceedings other than briefly and from a sedentary position. I hope, with your indulgence, to speak at greater length today.<br><br>
I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Whitney) for introducing this useful and highly technical measure. I am sure that all Conservative Members hope that it will eventually reach the statute book. However, we need to probe certain issues and therefore we should not give the Bill a totally free passage.<br><br>
We are grateful that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary is here. His wisdom will be of great value and his previous career as a lawyer will be helpful to the Committee on this highly technical measure.<br><br>
When I first looked at the Bill, I thought that there was little to be said about it. However, that was before I researched the matter and talked to a number of charity lawyers and accountants and to the Legislation Monitoring Service for Charities, which represents a number of charitable organisations, including the Association of Charity Officers, the Charities Aid Foundation, the Churches Main Committee and the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. I discussed it at length with a charity lawyer, Judith Hill of Farrer and Co., whose firm has an interest in the Bill, and I am grateful to her for her advice. I also discovered, rather to my surprise on such a technical measure, that several of my constituents had concerns about the Bill, and I shall deal with them in later amendments.<br><br>
This group of amendments gives us a chance to debate, for the first time, the principles underlying the Bill. There was no Second Reading debate on the Bill; it went through on the nod on the Floor of the House. This debate gives us an opportunity to establish
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0063">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
whether such a technical but, for many charities, important measure deserves amendment.<br><br>
We are in the slightly difficult position of debating the amendments before we have established the prime sponsor's motives for introducing the Bill. The amendments are coming before the principles. We are dancing round the maypole before we reach clause stand part, when we will be able to debate the principles.<br><br>
I acknowledge that this group of amendments covers a great deal of ground. Amendment No. 1 deals with the issue of "may" or "shall"—whether the Charity Commission should have a discretionary or an obligatory power. Amendments Nos. 2 to 6 enable us to consider whether certain parts of the Charities Act 1993 should be omitted from the powers that the charity commissioners can exercise in relation to charities with common trustees.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will indicate to my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe that he is prepared to accept a number of my later amendments, but like most of the amendments that I have tabled, these are all probing amendments. The two central issues dealt with in this group—apart from the issue of "may" or "shall"—are the compilation of accounts by charities and registration by charities.<br><br>
It could be argued that the word "may" creates uncertainty as it gives the charity commissioners a discretion when deciding whether charities can be treated as one charity under the Bill. As I understand it—my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary may correct me—the Bill sets down no established criteria for the charity commissioners to consider when deciding how to exercise their discretion to treat charities in the way proposed in the Bill. In the absence of any clear criteria, the trustees of any charity must be certain about whether any application under the Bill will be successful. Otherwise, the charity commissioners' decision may be considered to be arbitrary, which would create uncertainty in the minds of other charities that are thinking of taking the same route.<br><br>
I believe that provided that the trustees are at least in broad agreement about the application to the charity commissioners to be treated in the same way—I had tabled an amendment that dealt with the issue of unanimity, but I was advised by a number of charities that getting trustees to be unanimous about anything is rather tricky—and that the beneficiaries' interests have been considered, there should be greater certainty about the way in which any application is to be treated under the Bill. That is the purpose of amendment No. 1.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend touches upon an important part of the Bill. In that context, would he say a little about the relevance of the objects clause and how close in nature the objects of the two charities must be before they can be dealt with as a single charity with the same trustees? Members of the public and others give donations to charities on the basis of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
their objects. Two charities may be treated as a single charity, but their two sets of objects may not be identical. In that case, the intentions of the public—the donors—would be defeated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman cannot go wide of the amendments, which are specific.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) makes an important point. It is so important that I have tabled an amendment, for later consideration, to deal with it. I should like to return to the issue in detail because it raises an important question of principle.<br><br>
On the face of it, to change "may" to "shall" is a simple amendment but, as we know, it has huge potential consequences. I want my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe to reassure me that the Bill has been well thought through and that the powers that have been—or which are proposed to be—given to the charity commissioners in the Bill can be exercised in an appropriate fashion.<br><br>
As I understand the Bill—and this is where we must go into its principles—its principal objective is to enable the consolidation of the accounts of smaller charities. It is essentially a financial measure to ensure that there will be only one set of accounts for many different small charities. The difficulty is that, as an outsider—I am not a common trustee of a group of charities—one would never be entirely sure what money went where or what the ingredients of the individual charities were. There is a risk that one charity could be milked to pay for the activities of another.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stuart Randall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston upon Hull, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could explain his motives a little further. We are discussing almost enforcing the commission to consider as one charity two charities that have the same trustees. I should have thought that the trustees should have an input into the matter and that the commission would take that into account. Does not the amendment reduce the trustees' choice in how they administer their accounts?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the hon. Gentleman is right and that that will be the theme of the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe when he replies. I cannot be sure of that, but it is what I anticipate. We have had no opportunity to debate the principles of the Bill. I want my hon. Friend to explain how he expects trustees to apply to the Charity Commission to use the power that they would be granted by the Bill and how he expects the charity commissioners to respond to that—what procedures he expects them to go through.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Randall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But the hon. Gentleman is going further. He is proposing an amendment to enforce the commission. He is taking a strong line on the matter. I want to know why he is proposing the amendment, which would strengthen the Bill and direct the commissioner to take a certain action.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0064">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. I want to ask my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe why, if the power is so valuable, it should not be applied universally. I think that my hon. Friend will persuade me that the power should be discretionary and the word "may" should remain, but I want to hear him set out the arguments on that point. I suspect that he will satisfy me, although I could be proven wrong.<br><br>
The measure gives the charity commissioners the power to enable individual charities to cross-subsidise each other in a framework of common trustees. We must explore how they will exercise the power that they give to trustees in those circumstances. There is a risk of arbitrariness in the process. We do not know what tests will be applied or what evidence the trustees will be expected to produce to the Charity Commission when they make a proposal; neither do we know how the charity commissioners will respond.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Kent)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am ashamed to say that I am a stage further back than my hon. Friend. I am increasingly unclear about why we want the Bill at all. If it is in order, Mr. Martin, will my hon. Friend be kind enough to explain? The rationale clearly relates to "may" and "shall", so I want to know what the legislation's rationale is and the size of charities to which it is likely to apply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are discussing the amendments. The hon. Gentleman should have queried whether the legislation was desirable on Second Reading. We are now at the stage where we amend the legislation, and we are dealing with amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand, Mr. Martin. The difficulty is that the amendment would make it obligatory for the Charity Commission to take action which would not be a burden if it were discretionary, but would be a burden if it were made obligatory. My hon. Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr. Luff) should consider the size of the charities caught up in the process.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely the issue that I highlighted in my opening remarks. There is a difficulty because we have not debated the principles of the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe has written about the principles in an interesting article in <i>The House Magazine,</i> which I would be pleased to pass across to my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) to demonstrate the purpose of the Bill. I do not want to pre-empt what my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe may say, but my understanding is that we are talking about small charities. As is often the case, the driving force behind the provisions was the national health service, in relation to small bequests to hospitals for small purposes and the cumbersome bureaucracy surrounding them.<br><br>
We have an opportunity to debate the principle on stand part. We should explore the issue then. I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
certainly intend to ask the key question, do we need the Bill, or are the powers of the 1993 Charities Act adequate for the purpose? Remarks made in the current annual report of the charity commissioners lend credence to that possibility. I apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent, but I should like to deal with his question on stand part rather than now. I am persuaded of the need for the Bill. Everyone to whom I have spoken is anxious for it to reach the statute book. It is widely seen as a valuable deregulatory measure, especially for smaller charities.<br><br>
Amendment No. 2 would enable subsequent amendments Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 6 to take effect. It is based on my worry about the scope of the Bill. Do specific powers in the 1993 Act need to be excluded from the groups of relevant charities? We are giving an all-embracing power to the commissioners. The clause includes the provision:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Commissioners may direct that for all or any of the purposes of this Act two or more charities having the same charity trustees shall be treated as a single charity."</p></blockquote>
Is the scope of the Bill appropriate? If the only real issue is the accounts of smaller charities—though I also want to explore the registration of such charities—we should restrict the provisions to that issue.<br><br>
I suggest to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary—without saying anything about the drafting skills of my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe—that the Bill obviously owes something to the skills of Home Office officials. It is possible that the words "all or any of are superfluous, adding nothing to the meaning of the Bill. We should try to keep the language clear, simple and as free from unnecessary words as possible. Without those words the Bill would read:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Commissioners may direct that for the purposes of this Act"</p></blockquote>
two or more charities should be treated as a single charity. That has merit in clarification, but it is primarily intended to facilitate debate about parts II, V, VI and VIII of the Charities Act 1993. We should consider whether those parts are appropriate.<br><br>
I shall deal only briefly with amendment No. 3 because it is similar to new clause 1, so we can deal more fully with the issues when we debate that. It deals with the registration of charities and whether the charity commissioners should be denied the power to apply part II of the 1993 Act to the smaller combined charities. If part II is not excluded, two consequences are possible. First, the Bill could be construed as excluding the requirement of the charity commissioners to maintain a register of every charity. Subject to the exclusion of certain charities under section 3(5) of the 1993 Act, the register must be maintained for inspection by the public as an important safeguard, especially in the light of the benefits provided by charitable status, which accrue to small charities as much as large ones.<br><br>
Secondly, and I shall also deal with this in more detail when we debate new clause 1, the right of the

charity commissioners conferred by section 6 of he 1993 Act—the right to require a charity to change its name when appropriate—could be lost. That is another specific issue that may justify considering excluding part II of the 1993 Act from the scope of the Bill.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent said, the Committee may not be sure about the purpose of the Bill, but the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe may allow us to make a guess. I wish to offer a suggestion in relation to amendment No. 4. If we are dealing with smaller charities, do the powers to be conferred on the charity commissioners need to include the power to deal with charity land, as such smaller charities will not have land and assets? If part V of the 1993 Act is not excluded from the scope of the Bill, it is possible that a charity's trustees would be able to treat all the land that they hold under any number of different charities as land that is held by just one charity. The trustees would then be able to deal with all the land in one block and, under section 36 and other relevant sections of the 1993 Act, sell it.<br><br>
That could cause prejudice against beneficiaries, as the sale of land by the trustees may not be in the interests of the charity that holds that particular piece of land. The Bill must ensure that the charity commissioners regard as separate each piece of land held by each charity—the land may have been endowed by a donor in the past—and that they apply separate consideration to each piece of land before consenting to sell it. I therefore urge my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe to give serious thought to excluding part V of the 1993 Act from the scope of the Bill.<br><br>
I can tell the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) that amendment No. 5 is genuinely a probing amendment, but it provides an opportunity to debate one of the Bill's underlying principles. The amendment would exclude part VI of the 1993 Act, which deals with accounts, reports and returns. It is a wrecking amendment, so it is unlikely that I will press it to a Division, given that it deals with what I consider to be the meat of the Bill.<br><br>
Part VI of the Charities Act 1993 deals with the requirements for charities to maintain and deliver accounting records, reports and returns. It is essential that each charity is required to provide details of how it is run, what property it owns, what income it receives, and so on. I am worried that there is the potential for abuse of valuable charitable status if each charity is not exposed to scrutiny by the public and by the charity commissioners.<br><br>
There is a case for saying that each charity, no matter how small, must still be audited separately. Otherwise, trustees might be tempted wrongfully to transfer funds from one charity to another, or not to keep accurate records of each charity. Requirements such as that for the annual report to be available for public inspection—provided for under section 47 of the 1993 Act—are valuable safeguards.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
It is worth noting that the Government are currently consulting on the question of accounting by charities. Draft regulations were published in the consultation document of January this year entitled "Accounting by Charities: Draft Regulations". The document is subtitled "A consultation document on Part VI of the Charities Act 1993: draft regulations, annual reports, annual accounts, audit and independent examination; and draft Charity Commission guidance and direction on independent examination".<br><br>
My question may be more appropriately answered by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary than by my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe, but I am worried that we may be trying to do two things at once—we are consulting on charities' accounting procedures at the same time as we are introducing, by means of the Bill, new measures affecting charity finance. The consultation document sets out the Government's case clearly. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Charities are responsible for public money and must be accountable for the resources they control. Good charity accounts which show how the charity is using its resources and which are accurate, reliable, consistent and available to the public are very important in securing that objective. Part VI of the Charities Act 1993 provides an effective new legal framework for charity accounting and reporting to ensure this is achieved. Some charities are subject to other statutory requirements such as company law—this is explained later."</p></blockquote>
That is a clear defence of part VI of the Charities Act 1993. The question for my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary is why is it proposed to exempt those smaller charities from that provision.<br><br>
The document continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"The 1993 Act requires the Home Secretary to consult on Regulations under Part VI before they come into force. Consultation is also a valuable opportunity to raise awareness of these new provisions and explain how they should operate."</p></blockquote>
The Government's timetable has slipped already; there is a manuscript amendment to that paragraph, made by some diligent Home Office official, saying that the intention is
<br><blockquote><p>"to make the regulations later this summer, to come into force on 1 March 1996."</p></blockquote>
Originally it said:
<br><blockquote><p>"during July, to come into force on 1 December 1995."</p></blockquote>
I am not sure what the difference is between later this summer and during July.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely there is a cost to all that accounting. There must be a raft of charities whose income or capital is so small that to lay down the sort of accounting procedures that are appropriate for Barnado's or the Shaftesbury Society would be unfair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I would expect from someone who is playing such keen attention to the Bill, my hon. Friend has anticipated some of my later remarks. I suspect that my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe will tell me that a balance must be struck between the burdens we should impose on those smaller charities,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0066">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
which often deal with only a few hundred pounds, and the needs of accountability. I hope that he will be able to persuade me on that.<br><br>
The Government seem to recognise the point in their document. They say, under the heading, "What's new?"—a charmingly colloquial term:
<br><blockquote><p>"The main changes introduced by Part VI and the draft regulations are:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>A detailed statutory framework for the maintenance of accounting records and for the preparation of charity accounts and annual reports."</p></blockquote>
That is as one would expect. The second change is:
<br><blockquote><p>"A required 'statement of financial activities' "—</p></blockquote>
rejoicing in the delightful acronym of SOFA—
<br><blockquote><p>"as the basis of accounts for larger charities"—</p></blockquote>
that deals with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent—
<br><blockquote><p>"… focusing on analysis of all incoming resources and the application of resources."</p></blockquote>
The third change is:
<br><blockquote><p>"A statutory requirement for charity audit, mainly for larger charities, and less rigorous 'independent examination' for smaller charities."</p></blockquote>
The fourth change, and perhaps the most important in light of my hon. Friend's concern, is:
<br><blockquote><p>"A new 'light touch' regime for the smallest registered charities. These will be required to prepare and keep accounts and reports but will not ordinarily have to submit them to the Charity Commission and will not normally be required to undergo audit or independent examination.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>These charities will have to complete a short annual return to the Charity Commission as a matter of public record but will not routinely be subjected to scrutiny."</p></blockquote>
That paragraph sent an alarm bell ringing in my mind. If the Government already have the power under part VI of the Act and, as the consultation document seems to say, they intend to use it to exempt smaller charities from the full burdens of preparing accounts, do we need the Bill? Are the Government proposing to introduce measures that suffice in themselves? My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary must respond to that point before I let the amendment go.<br><br>
The Government, rightly, say that they have a balanced approach to regulation. The document states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government's objective is to ensure that charities are accountable for their funds and actions to donors, beneficiaries and the general public. Charities must be effectively supervised but the burden on them should also be kept to the minimum necessary to achieve this objective."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why does my hon. Friend describe amendment No. 5 as a wrecking amendment? Surely it is far from being that. There is no reference in clause 1 to small charities, yet he has already described the exemptions that exist for small charities. Should larger charities enjoy the benefit of clause 1 in that respect?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point that I had not considered. Perhaps there should have been an amendment—sadly, we cannot now have one—to deal with the exemption of larger charities. Perhaps it is wrong for the Bill to be so ambitious in its scope. We may want to return to that on clause stand part. In their consultation document, the Government clearly understand the need to distinguish between large, medium-sized and small charities, yet there is no recognition of that in the Bill. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will respond to that.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
I do not want to labour the issue of accounts. We have had a good debate about it and I have made all the points that I want to make. Instead, I want to draw one other issue to the Committee's attention. It will amplify the point already made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield. The Government identify different types of charities on page 8 of the consultation document. I will not weary members of the Committee by taking them through all five examples, but the document states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The following is intended only as a brief guide to the most commonly found structures and their related reporting arrangements. The Charity Commission intend to issue further guidance on this."</p></blockquote>
Example one, which need not concern us at all today, is where the trustees are responsible for a single charity. That is clearly outside the scope of the Bill. Example two is where the trustees are responsible for
<br><blockquote><p>"a main charity with local branches which are controlled by the main charity".</p></blockquote>
The document goes on to say that
<br><blockquote><p>"provided the local branches are under the control of the main charity they are all treated as part of the main charity for accounting purposes and one set of accounts, one return and one report covering the activities of the main charity and its branches will be required."</p></blockquote>
That seems to go a long way towards what my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe sought when he introduced the Bill.<br><br>
Example three is where the trustees are responsible for
<br><blockquote><p>"a main charity with affiliated autonomous local groups".</p></blockquote>
That need not concern us today because each charity would still be required to submit its own return under present provisions. Example four is where
<br><blockquote><p>"trustees are responsible for a main charity with subsidiary charitable funds which are to be applied for particular purposes".</p></blockquote>
Example five concerns group registration of charities and says that
<br><blockquote><p>"in some cases, a number of charities, usually with a common trustee body, have been registered by the Commission as though they constituted a single charity. The Charity Commission intend to notify all such charities of their reporting obligations in advance of Part VI coming into force."</p></blockquote>
That is a fascinating paragraph. It seems to say that the charity commissioners already have the power that the Bill would confer upon them and that they are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0067">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
exercising it. Charities are, therefore, currently enjoying the provisions that the Bill is intended to give them. Will my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe give an explanation on that point, because if the 1993 Act is already doing what the Bill sets out to do, what are we doing here this morning? I would appreciate some clarification.<br><br>
Amendment No. 6 would provide for the exemption of part VIII of the Charities Act 1993. Part VIII deals with provisions that relate specifically to charitable companies and, in particular, their winding up under section 63 of the Act. It also includes section 64, the alterations of objects clause, and section 68, which provides for charities' status to appear on correspondence. Those specific provisions in relation to charitable companies may need to be excluded from the Bill, because otherwise each charitable company will not have to be dealt with separately and the corporate identity of each charitable company that is part of a conglomeration of charities may be lost. The strict requirement of corporate status is a safeguard that we should throw away only with great reluctance and after the most careful consideration.<br><br>
It is worth pausing to reflect on the structure of certain charities. It is often the case that a charitable trust controls a separate charitable company. In fact, the charitable trust and the charitable company will often have the same individuals involved as trustees of both. Charities in that situation regard the provision as an important safeguard for their own success.<br><br>
We thus return to the way in which the Charity Commission will exercise the powers that the Bill will confer on it. Will it force people to move to a status that they do not seek? That would be a retrograde measure that the Committee should not endorse. Perhaps I might give a practical example of how that works for a charity. We do not want a debate about the political involvement of charities, but many charities exist to spread a message, whether that be educational, religious or about third world development issues.<br><br>
As members of the Committee will be aware, I come from a public relations background. I know that in the modern world, spreading the message is an expensive process that can involve a variety of techniques. They might include, for example, training spokesmen to appear on television or radio, or the production of expensive booklets and videos. I think that I am right that charities are debarred from advertising themselves, although that might not be the case—my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe will correct me. At any rate, many expenses can be incurred by charities when they seek to spread their message.<br><br>
Conservative Members who have been involved in the private sector know that, with the best will in the world, a company that spends money can make mistakes and get itself into debt from which it cannot recover. It may, heaven forfend, libel or slander someone in certain documents or by something said by a spokesman and could find itself being sued. A
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
legal action, whether for a commercial judgment or defamation, could have a serious impact on a charity. If the charity and the charitable company were to be merged into one, there would be a risk that all the charity's funds would be lost. By keeping them separate, the charitable company, using the benefits conferred on it by limited liability, could protect the charity's main funds.<br><br>
Often, the charity makes a regular annual grant to the limited liability charitable company, which means that the main funds from the donors to the charity are protected from unintentional mistakes in the limited liability company. The charity's effective creditors—although in law they are the creditors of the limited liability company—can only have recourse to the limited liability company. I do not suggest that charities would use the measure dishonestly to protect themselves from commercial activity, but it is a prudent device, used widely in the private sector to insulate specific risks or parts of a group of companies. I do not understand why charities should be denied the same protection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Lidington <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aylesbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that as well as providing some protection against a loss due to genuine mistakes by people responsible for administering a charity's commercial activity, the system that he has just described—that degree of separation, those Chinese walls—also provides some protection against fraud and malpractice? Although the vast majority of people involved in operating charities in Britain are scrupulously honest, there is always a risk of a minority falling prey to nefarious behaviour. The safeguards described by my hon. Friend would be safeguards against fraud as much as against genuine error.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an interesting point, and reinforces my concern that we should not put charities in the position of being treated as one compulsorily by the Charity Commission. The "may"/"shall" amendment is important. We need to be sure of the terms in which the amendment will be used. For reasons explained by my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) and me, a charity's trustees would be aggrieved if they found themselves compelled to behave in a certain manner that they considered contrary to the interests of the charity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has confused me totally. I thought that he said that the amendment enforces the Charity Commission. Has he tabled the amendment purely in order that it may then be sat upon from a great height and crushed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I clarified that point when I answered the intervention of the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall), but obviously I did not. Amendment No. 1 is a genuine probing amendment, to enable me to be certain in my own mind that there are safeguards on how the Charity Commission will exercise the powers that it is given under the Bill. It is highly unlikely that, at the end of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0068">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
the debate on this group, I will seek to press the amendment to a vote, but I want my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe to reassure me that the charity commissioners will not use their powers arbitrarily. That could have serious consequences for trustees. What procedure will the commissioners have to follow if the Bill's provisions are to be used to combine two or more charities and to treat them as one charity? The Bill is silent on that point. I have read the Charities Act 1993 briefly, but I am not a lawyer so I find it rather difficult to be sure of exactly what it means—but I cannot see any explanation of how the commissioners might exercise their powers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hillsborough)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain how this group of amendments would deal with the issue that has been raised by my constituents and which is the subject of a starred amendment in his name? What effect will substituting "shall" for "may" have?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of the concerns at which the hon. Lady hints and will return to the substance of her comments when we discuss amendment No. 12, although they could be dealt with earlier.<br><br>
I am not drawn to the principle of compulsion being brought to bear on the charity commissioners. It perhaps worries the people who have expressed concerns to the hon. Lady—and my constituents have expressed such concerns to me—and it might be even more damaging than they fear.<br><br>
This is an important issue and a number of people outside this place are concerned about it. There is some concern about trustees being forced to behave in a way that they believe will be contrary to their interests.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Peter Lloyd <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fareham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's general concern, but what particular worries does he have? In which ways might a charity be compelled to behave in a manner that is inimical to its charitable purposes? The hon. Gentleman has studied the Bill with greater care than I have, but it appears to refer to reports, returns and accounts that the Charity Commission might require under the law. He obviously has additional worries, however, and it would be helpful if he could put them to the members of the Committee so that we could judge them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am rather impressed by my flow of logic because I seem to be anticipating hon. Member's interventions as they arise. My next remark was intended to address precisely my right hon. Friend's point, which concerns the interaction of part VI of the Charities Act 1993 and company legislation. It might be that the issue that I have highlighted is only a canard or an aunt Sally, which could be knocked down by my hon. Friends. It might be that company legislation provisions already give charities the protection that they seek. I do not know, however, because I am not a company or charity lawyer.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
Charities have told me that they could be compelled to consolidate their accounts and activities in a way that would be inimical to their interests. I am sure that officials at the Home Office and my hon. Friend for Wycombe have considered that issue and that my hon. Friend will be able to reassure me. There is, however, a genuinely and deeply held concern that charities might be forced to combine activities that they do not believe should be combined. The example of a charity and a charitable company is only the most dramatic.<br><br>
We shall return to those concerns on later amendments, when we deal with the issue of broadly similar objectives. Concerns have been expressed that charities in those circumstances should not be forced to combine and lose their identity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why does my hon. Friend think that the Charity Commission might act arbitrarily? When has it ever acted arbitrarily? Would not it be open to anyone who thought that it had done so to seek judicial review of its decision on the ground that it had behaved unreasonably? Surely, the Bill envisages circumstances in which the trustees of two or more charities want them to be treated as a single charity for administrative simplicity?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I sincerely hope that is the case, but that is not what the Bill says. It gives an unfettered power to the Charity Commission to do what it wants when two charities have common trustees. I want a statement in the Committee from my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary that makes that clarification.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Peter Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The power is not wholly unfettered. The new subsection (6) to section 96 of the Charities Act 1993 proposed in clause 1 of the Bill begins with the phrase:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Commissioners may direct that for all or any of the purposes of this Act"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the 1993 Act. My hon. Friend the Member for Worcester therefore ought to consider what the 1993 Act contains, as it provides protections and limitations on what the charity commissioners can require.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. That may be the case, but I want to hear my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary say it. I am merely voicing a genuine concern that has been expressed to me by the representatives of smaller charities.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield asked why I thought that the charity commissioners might behave unreasonably. I do not think that they would. I have no interests to declare—I am no longer a member or trustee of any charity, but in my experience the complaint against the charity commissioners is that they have caused delay, not got on with matters quickly enough, or given charities speedy answers to questions. That is the problem.<br><br>
I am worried that the constant—and proper—pressures for efficiency in public expenditure, which is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0069">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
felt by every Government agency or independent body responsible for public funds, may lead to charities with common trustees being lumped together. The charity commissioners are currently assembling a computerised database, which will make it easier for them to establish which trusts have common trustees. The commissioners may feel that they cannot be bothered with the 20 or 30 different trusts at an NHS hospital, for instance, and so decide to put them all together, contrary to the wishes of trustees.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it would be relatively simple for trustees who are worried about that to evade the purposes of the Bill? They could appoint to one of their trustee boards a trustee who is not common to all the other trustees. Would not that allow them to escape the rigours described by my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an ingenious point. I am always saddened when a Member of Parliament has to suggest such deviousness to overcome the effects of a Bill. I hope that we shall learn that such deviousness is not required of charity trustees and that they can express a wish to be combined without being compelled to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not devious until I entered the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is a man of great integrity. It is only his acute logic that drives him to reach the conclusion that he did. I am sure that he would never wish to put such deviousness into practice.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield made one other point that needs to be knocked firmly on the head. I assume that he was right to say that the charity commissioners could be subject to judicial review. I certainly know of no statutory provision that exempts them from such review. However, the Bill deals with smaller charities that have only a few hundred or few thousand pounds at their disposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lidington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where does it say that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It does not. That is what is frustrating about this group of amendments. We are forced to debate details before we have discussed the principles underlying the Bill. I am relying on what my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe has said and written about the Bill's purpose, and on what other people outside the House think about it. I have never been told its purpose formally in the House. However, I assume that it deals with smaller charities. I wish that the Bill contained a definition of such charities, but we shall discuss definitions later.<br><br>
I assume that the Bill is a deregulatory measure for the benefit of smaller charities. We cannot credibly tell such charities that they can get a judicial review in the High Court. That would be impossible for them, but under the Bill it is their only safeguard against abuse.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend agree that it would be better to spell out in the Bill the way in which the power should be exercised, or at least to explore the issues relating to the purposes of the Charities Act 1993? If we leave it that trustees or aggrieved persons can take matters to judicial review, money would in effect be taken from the pockets of the people in need of charity and put in the pockets of lawyers, who are the last people to deserve charity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can safely agree with my hon. Friend without incurring too much wrath from other members of the Committee.<br><br>
It is too late to make that specific amendment to the Bill and to deal with the definition of a smaller charity. Nevertheless, I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will make it clear that is the purpose of the Bill. As I understand it, it would constrain the charity commissioners in their exercise of the power. I would like a clear Government statement as to what exactly the Bill is intended to achieve. With the safeguard included, Conservative Members could breathe more easily and feel a lot happier about the Bill.<br><br>
Time is pressing and we still have to consider new clause 1, so I wish to finish with comments about amendment No. 6, which raises difficult issues—my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary may have to write to me about them. Interaction is necessary between the accounts required under the Charities Act 1993 and those required under company law, which I find difficult to understand. Smaller charities are to be treated—de facto and de iure—as one charity for the 1993 Act. That is fine and dandy—the deregulatory measure is there. However, those charities will not be able to be treated separately for purposes of tax or company law. The Bill does not deal with those matters, so what purpose does it serve? Is it genuinely deregulatory, or are burdens still imposed on charities that will have to be fulfilled even if not put in an envelope and sent to the Charity Commission? That is my worry.<br><br>
It is fine to consolidate the accounts of smaller charities for the purposes of the charity commissioners, but Customs and Excise, VAT, Inland Revenue and Companies house may take a different view. Is the Bill truly as deregulatory as we hope?<br><br>
New clause 1, which I mentioned briefly in connection with amendment No. 3, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Nothing in this Act shall exempt the Commissioners from their duty to keep a register of charities containing the name of every registered charity."</p></blockquote>
As drafted, the Bill would exempt the trustees of small charities from that requirement, which is a potentially serious problem. The Bill should not detract from the commissioners' main duty of maintaining an up-to-date register of all charities in England and Wales. Does the Charity Commission intend to maintain a full and comprehensive register or does it want the Bill to exempt smaller charities from that requirement?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0070">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
The accountability of trustees would be seriously diminished if the requirement to register were to be removed. "Charities: Law and Practice" by Elizabeth Cairns states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Once registered an organisation is conclusively presumed to be a charity. The particulars of each registered charity are recorded on the Central Register of Charities, which is open to inspection by the public. The Register of Charities was until recently kept manually and since much of the information it contained was based on details provided at the time of registration it tended to be inaccurate and out of date. In 1990 computerised records were introduced and plans made for them to be checked and updated regularly. Initially the details contained in the manual records were transposed on to the computer and consequently errors and out-of-date information has been carried into the new system. In 1991"—</p></blockquote>
this shows the importance that the commissioners appear to attach to an effective register—
<br><blockquote><p>"the Commissioners began circularising all registered charities requesting the charity trustees to check the information on the Register for their charity and correct any inaccuracies. Section 45 of the Charities Act requires an annual report to be submitted to the Commissioners and it is hoped in this way that changes in the names and addresses of the correspondents and the annual income of the charity will be regularly updated and the Register will become a much more useful tool for those interested in charities than it ever was in the past.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The information held on the Register includes the objects of charity, details of the governing instrument including the date when it became operative, the annual income of the charity and the name and address of the person to whom correspondence should be sent."</p></blockquote>
It is important to remember that the register is not a seal of approval for charities. As Elizabeth Cairns states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Contrary to widely-held belief registration does not imply that a charity is either well-run or deserves support. The Commissioners are obliged to register any organisation which is established for charitable purposes (other than those mentioned above) regardless of merit and even where doubts exist as to the good faith of the promoters. Registration therefore implies no more than that the Charity Commissioners are satisfied that the particular organisation fulfils the necessary conditions. Despite the defects and limitations of the registration arrangements the Register provides a useful service for those wishing to give to charity, to the Inland Revenue in processing claims for repayment of tax and in checking abuse and dishonesty in fund raising."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friends raised questions about whether smaller charities are included in the Bill, but if smaller charities are to be exempted from the requirement to register, we need to know what the consequences will be.<br><br>
I hope that I will be able to deal with other groups of amendments more briefly but that group is important and encapsulates the Bill and all its purposes. I apologise for the time that I have taken. I look forward to hearing from my hon. Friends the Member for Wycombe and the Under-Secretary in response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Randall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments seek to improve the efficiency of the Charity Commission and of charities' accounting and book-keeping. The hon. Member for Worcester spoke at length but I was not persuaded for a moment that his amendments do anything other than tinker with something tiny. It is bringing a massive sledgehammer to crack a small nut.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
I want to reconcile those matters to practice. I visited the Charity Commission and examined the way that it does things. All the names are computerised and the information that is received is put into the machine. The registration of charities is not a particularly onerous or costly task. The system is in place and seen to be working, so there is not a lot of money to be saved in that regard. We should leave discretion to the charities because otherwise all sorts of loopholes will arise, causing difficulties.<br><br>
Like Conservative Members, I am not sure of the real motives behind the Bill. Does the charity industry want the change—in particular, amendment No. 1? I have never picked up that anyone thinks there is inefficiency in that regard. Every member of the Committee wants charities to work well and efficiently because they do good work, but we must remember that in the past there have been abuses of the tax help to which charities are entitled. We must be careful about that.<br><br>
Consolidation of accounts is purely practical. Good Lord, we are talking about small charities. Most people have a personal home computer these days and keeping the accounts of small charities is not particularly onerous. The consequence of the hon. Gentleman's amendment will be to merge those into one and to submit one set of accounts. We are playing around on the periphery of things.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with much that the hon. Gentleman said. However, because of the host of changes in the national health service, particularly in the way it is administered and organised and in the scale of the various units, there has been anxiety that several relatively small, possibly somewhat ancient, endowments are lying dormant and cannot be got at to any useful purpose. Such endowments take up such a small proportion of the time of, for example, the busy lawyer who is the active trustee but nothing is done with them. That is a source of considerable frustration. My hon. Friend the Member for Worcester must speak for himself, but I imagine that is what lies behind his interest.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Randall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to the hon. Gentleman's comments, but I cannot reconcile them with amendment No. 1, which relates to treating two charities into one when the trustees are the same. The hon. Gentleman's point is reasonable as there are many small charities. However, they are all registered. They might be dormant, but in that they are like my Barclaycard—I have one, but I do not use it. It sits dormant and does not cost the company anything to process. I pay it £40 a year for doing nothing, because I use a different credit card company. The same principle applies to small charities.<br><br>
I do not think there would be any considerable associated costs and I am not persuaded by the hon. Gentleman's argument. The Bill is really a public Bill and I shall listen to the Under-Secretary with interest.

If he says that the Government do not support the amendments, I would be inclined to go along with him. I always find it difficult to vote with the Government, so I would probably abstain.<br><br>
Perhaps I might give an example of my own. It relates to amendment No. 1, which means I am keeping in order. I have had representations from an organisation in my constituency called Yorkshire Farm Bakery which has two charities, on which amendment No. 1 would have an impact. One of the charities deals with the alleviation of poverty. Although I do not know the details, it sounds as though it would come under the traditional criteria that one must use to establish status. The other charity relates to the church that Yorkshire Farm Bakery operates. Will the Under-Secretary refer to that matter under amendment No. 1? The Yorkshire Farm Bakery organisation does not want the two charities to be merged, on the ground that a merger would burden the commission.<br><br>
Amendment No. 27, which is starred, has not been selected, so I would be out of order if I referred to it and you would be down on me like a tonne of bricks, Mr. Martin. Therefore, although the registration of the sort of church run by Yorkshire Farm Bakery is affected, I cannot speak directly to the amendment. I would be grateful if the Under-Secretary would consider that case in the contest of amendment No. 1.<br><br>
The Government have produced a technical document and we all commend them for preparing it and for looking for major areas of efficiency savings. I have to say that I am not persuaded by the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ray Whitney <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wycombe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful for the opportunity to speak at this stage of the debate. First—and I am sure that I speak for the whole Committee—I offer congratulations and thanks to my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester for the work that he has done. He has demonstrated a deep and awe-inspiring knowledge of the subject of my little Bill. I recognise my hon. Friend's point that, because of the quirks of the parliamentary system, we did not have the benefit of a proper Second Reading debate and we were therefore unable to explore—and I was unable to set out—the principle of the Bill.<br><br>
My hon. Friend was kind enough to acknowledge that I sought to explain the Bill's principle to the House via my article in <i>The House Magazine.</i> The issue is simple—in essence, we seek to make a small, ameliorating change to the Charities Act 1993. Although I am the chairman of two charities, I am no expert in the field. As I understand it, experts regard it as a beneficent change when the same set of trustees are responsible for several different charitable funds. It strikes a happy balance between the need for accountability—which we all recognise and adhere to—and the equally or perhaps even more desirable objective of lightening the bureaucratic burden. That is the long and the short of it and I do not think that my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester would dissent
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
from that objective. If, during our discussions, we can find ways of gilding the lily and improving the Bill, no one would welcome that more than I.<br><br>
My hon. Friend said that some of his amendments were in the nature of aunt Sallies to be shot at and possibly knocked down, which is what I shall endeavour to do with this set of amendments. But I pay tribute to him for giving us the opportunity to have this interesting and important discussion.<br><br>
The Bill has nothing to do with the size of charities. The power of direction will apply to all charities regardless of size. A unifying direction by the commissioners will not affect the separate legal identity of each charity in the group; it will simply make the job of the trustees easier by removing unnecessary bureaucracy. If small charities wish to amalgamate—have a legal merger—they can do so under section 74 of the 1993 Act.<br><br>
I have emphasised constantly that the thrust and objective of the Bill is to reduce the amount of work for all concerned—both for charities and for the charity commissioners. I do not believe that any of the amendments is in conformity with that objective. Indeed, what appears to be the relatively straightforward substitution of "shall" for "may" in amendment No. 1 would radically change the nature of the Bill. As presently drafted, the Bill allows the charity commissioners to make a direction as envisaged. The amendment would compel the commissioners to act in that way. It is highly desirable to accept the provision as currently drafted, but highly undesirable to oblige it to be used in the way proposed in the amendment.<br><br>
Flexibility is vital. It may be coincidental that two charities have the same trustees. The objects of two charities may be wholly different and it may be wholly inappropriate to direct that they should be regarded as the same charity. By the same token, charities with a common administration may need a separate registration to facilitate fundraising. A uniting direction must, therefore, be a matter for the commissioners' discretion. I am not convinced that the purposes of effective charitable work would be best served by the amendments. Moreover, I believe that the Charity Commission would be required to engage in considerable extra work and to make inquiries into the charities concerned to fulfil such an obligation. We would be ill advised to add to the Charity Commission's work unless the objectives attained thereby would be of great benefit to all. The amendments would reduce flexibility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept entirely what my hon. Friend said about the affect of "may" and "shall", but in debating the issue I hoped to explore the way in which the Charity Commission would use its powers. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary may want to deal with that matter. Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 go some way towards dealing with that issue and would place an obligation on the Charity Commission to consult before making a direction, but I am still
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0072">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
nervous about the way in which it will use those powers. If the Under-Secretary intends to deal with that issue and give us a hint of the procedure to be followed, I am content to accept my hon. Friend's view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whitney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will speak for himself, but I am sure that the charity commissioners will take careful note of the points made by my hon. Friend and the concerns that he has expressed. Speaking personally, I have no doubt that the commissioners discharge their responsibility extremely well.<br><br>
The amendments would reduce the flexibility of commissioners to act in other ways. The charity commissioners may wish to direct that for all purposes of the Charities Act 1993, two or more charities having the same charity trustees should be treated as a single charity. However, in other circumstances there may be a good case for making a direction that extends to some but not all purposes of the 1993 Act. There could be instances when a charity needs a separate registration for fundraising purposes, when it would be administratively more convenient and more helpful to the trustees for it to be accounted for as part of a group of charities with common administrations. The amendment would preclude limiting a direction in that way. I believe that it would be more useful to allow the commissioners to exercise their discretion when considering the needs of particular charities and their accountability.<br><br>
The effect of excluding part II, which covers the registration of charities, would be that the charity commissioners could not direct that two or more charities having the same trustees should be treated as a single charity. Therefore, charities with a common administration could not be registered as a group. Given that one of the principal purposes of the Bill is to save the time and expense of unnecessary separate registrations, that would be a perverse result. Worse still, as the amendment would not disallow the commissioners making a direction for other purposes, to prevent them from making a direction for a group to be registered as a single charity would produce an odd result, to say the least. I argue strongly against the Committee adopting the amendment. It follows that if a series of separate charities is to be treated as a single charity, in pursuance of a direction of the charity commissioners under the provisions in the Bill, it should be possible to carry this through to all parts of the relevant legislation.<br><br>
Provisions on charity land are important parts of the Charities Act 1993. The exclusion of part V of the 1993 Act would require charity trustees and the charity commissioners to go through the control of charity land procedures separately if land is owned by more than one charity in a group with common administrations. Such cases might not arise very often, but the additional work involved would be considerable. Furthermore, the cost of obtaining and considering separate professional reports and of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
making separate consent orders would be substantially higher. The idea is to reduce additional work and expense, but it would not introduce further safeguards, so I believe that the provision is better left as drafted in the Bill. I urge that view on members of the Committee.<br><br>
Part VI of the Charities Act 1993 covers the new provisions—not yet in force—relating to charity accounts and reports. My hon. Friend the Member for Worcester made several references to them. They are extremely important provisions, which go to the heart of charities and demonstrate their accountability. Such provisions are distinctly relevant to the Bill, which will make it possible for charities to avoid having to submit entirely separate accounts, with entirely separate independent examination or audit reports, when they are operated as a single charity. That should be reflected in the aarrangements for the preparation and delivery of accounts. If a number of charities with common trustees are to be treated as a single charity, it follows that one single entity can report as a single charity.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Worcester asked why we were exempting charities from the new accounting requirements. Each amalgamated charity will still have to account separately in its statement of accounts for separate charitable funds under the umbrella charity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Peter Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the accounts be presented in some collective form, or will the trustees have to account separately to the Charity Commission?</span></p>
<p>11.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whitney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that there will be one set of accounts.<br><br>
I assure members of the Committee that the proposal does not remove the obligation on the trustees of one or several charities to account for funds held for specific purposes. When money has been provided to a charity on condition that it will be used for a particular purpose, it is a matter of general trust law that that requirement must be fulfilled. That principle is not undermined simply because there are other, possibly similar, funds being administered by the same charity. I should also point out that when more than one charity is grouped with others in a way that will be provided by the Bill, it is possible that the resulting group accounts will be scrutinised more carefully; increasing levels of scrutiny will be applied under part VI as the size of the charity increases. For example, a larger charity with a number of smaller ones under its wing may exceed the level of income or expenditure at which audit becomes compulsory, which is £250,000.<br><br>
Part VIII of the Charities Act 1993 contains provisions relating to charitable companies. Although it is unlikely that the new power proposed would be used in the context of of part VIII, there could be cost savings when dealing with a group of charitable
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0073">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
companies if they are treated as a single charity. It would be possible to institute a single set of legal proceedings under section 63 of the 1993 Act, covering winding up, restoration to the register and so on, rather than having several sets of proceedings.<br><br>
I hope that I have explained why I can support none of the amendments proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester, useful though his contributions have been to the debate. As for new clause 1, the charity commissioners have a duty under section 3 of the Charities Act 1993 to keep a register of all charities that that Act requires to be registered. The commissioners are also obliged to enter into the register the name of every registered charity and such other particulars as they see fit. The Bill will not alter the present position. There is no need for my hon. Friend's amendment, so I cannot support it. What it seeks to protect is already secure.<br><br>
The Committee stands in the debt of my hon. Friend and I hope that he will not take it amiss that my response to his amendments has been negative. I remain convinced by the primary objective of the Bill, which is to help with the administration of charities and reduce bureaucracy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it would be helpful if the Under-Secretary would clarify what sort of charities he expects to benefit from the Bill? That is an important consideration with regard to the amendments that we have just discussed. Will they be small or medium-sized charities? What will be the nature of the charities? I realise that that may be a clause stand part issue. I am inclined to accept what my hon. Friend has said about my amendments, but it would be helpful to have a little guidance on the principle underlying the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whitney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has heard what my hon. Friend has said that that he will respond in his own way. New clause 1 is directed at many of the very small charities that exist in the national health service sector. I am advised that there may be as many as 50,000 to 60,000 such funds. Although the Bill does not relate to the size of charities, its impact will be extremely beneficial in that sector.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Nicholas Baker)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, may I say what a pleasure it is, Mr. Martin, to serve under your chairmanship? We know that we will be kept in order gracefully, humorously and firmly, which we appreciate.<br><br>
We are debating a technical Bill and my hon. Friends are extremely concerned about some aspects of it. What my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe said so eloquently has gone a long way to dispel those worries and has explained some of the thinking behind the Bill. I congratulate him on his efforts in getting the Bill to its Committee stage.<br><br>
I shall try to answer as many questions as I can. I start with the question asked by the hon. Member for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
Kingston upon Hull, West, who unfortunately is not here at the moment. He asked whether charities want the Bill. Yes, they do; they see it as a useful but limited measure of deregulation. He described the Bill as sheer practical stuff. It allows the commissioners to deal more simply with charities on various practical matters. Mention was made of the great number of charities in the national health service—which was the fons et origo of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Spanish practices.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend refers, slightly offhandedly, to the inadequacy of my Spanish, but he is right to do so.<br><br>
The Bill started with those NHS charities, but it was felt right, for the standing of the power at law as well as for its possible convenience to other charities, that it should be allowed to other charities and not the NHS charities only. The fact that the Bill affects religious charities has been mentioned by several people. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent is worried about that. The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West has told me of the worries expressed by Yorkshire Farm Bakery in his constituency and I have received a letter from Mr. John Mounter of Poole in the south of Dorset. They have all expressed the same worry—that the power may somehow threaten the non-registrability of a number of religious charities.<br><br>
Excepted charities are those within the jurisdiction of the Charity Commission that are relieved of the duty to register and the duties following from that. Registered places of worship—there are, of course, many thousands—have been excepted since the registration of charities was first required in the Charities Act 1960. The Bill makes no change to that position. Indeed, it is important that it should not.<br><br>
In many cases, a uniting direction by the commissioners could save the trustees of charities excepted from registration from the burden of preparing separate reports and accounts. The fear is that the commissioners might make a united direction for the purpose of registration that would have the effect of registering the excepted charities. That fear is misconceived. In such cases, the commissioners would limit the scope of the uniting direction to exclude registration. I hope that I have answered those worries.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, Mr. Martin, I was urgently called out of the Room just before my hon. Friend started to deal with this important subject. However, what he said will come as a great relief to those of my constituents who are members of the Barnet Meeting Room Trust, who were worried that their trust might be united with the Hillside Charitable Trust, which has the same body of trustees but an entirely different object. The Barnet Meeting Room Trust is not required to register and is worried that it would be obliged to register under the Bill. What my hon. Friend said will be a great relief to them.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent has let me down slightly by referring to his starred amendment, which I carefully avoided mentioning. He is, as ever, assiduous in looking after his constituents, and has rightly made that point, as has my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere. I am glad to give them—and, indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester—the assurance that they require.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This issue has been raised by my consituent Stephen Mann, of 150 Bath Road, Worcester, who is a trustee of a church in the position that we are discussing. Will my hon. Friend confirm beyond doubt that what he said has the effect of law? My constituent will be relieved if that is so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall repeat the assurance that I have given. My hon. Friend the Member for Worcester, too is assiduous in looking after his constituents' interests. I should ram the point home—the use of the direction is not compulsory. That is why, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe said, we should reject amendment No. 1. The commission's power is permissive; if the trustees do not want it exercised, it will not—as I understand the commission's practice—be exercised. It will be considered only if the trustees want it to be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has been talking about the worries encapsulated in the amendment that we are not allowed to discuss. Is he saying that the Charity Commission will operate the power with willing charities only? Will the power be used only after negotiation and agreement? Will he confirm that the power is permissive and will not be used compulsorily?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is so. It accords not only with the wording of the Bill, but with the practice of the commissioners.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The wording of the Bill is clear and describes the practice of the commission. I realise that it is difficult for my hon. Friend to speak for the commissioners ex cathedra.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is my understanding of the practice of the commission, so I hope that I can reassure my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems that a Minister's understanding of the practice of a body that he does not control is a little short of an assurance that the body will not exercise the power arbitrarily. Will my hon. Friend clarify that it is his wish that the power be exercised only if the trustees of a charity apply to the Charity Commission to be treated in such a way? Will he say that it is not his wish that the commission can trawl through its register, identify charities with common trustees and then enforce the power? Is it his wish that the power be bottom up and voluntary and that it be exercised only when there is a clear wish for that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can express my understanding of the commission's powers and practice and how I expect
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
the power to be exercised; I can even express my wishes—but I cannot, in a legally enforceable way, say how the commission will operate. It is difficult, if not impossible, for me to envisage circumstances in which the commission would exercise the direction contrary to the wishes of trustees. If it did, it would be subject to judicial appeal, as has been said.<br><br>
The amendments were tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester, who spoke, in what was a tour de force speech, of dancing round the maypole. He rightly mentioned that there were no criteria for exercising the discretion. The circumstances in which the commissioners might use the new power may vary widely and it is important that they have flexibility. I have been trying not to dance away from the maypole but to make it clear that the commissioners should have flexibility to respond to the practical needs of charities in different circumstances. The power will be exercised to promote the effective use of charitable resources. By saving unnecessary work, the power will help the trustees and the commissioners. My hon. Friend mentioned transfers from one sub-charity to another and asked what a unifying direction would be. The power would not go against charities' need to use funds for the purpose that they were given.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
There is no suggestion that we are trying in clause 1—even unamended by amendment No. 1—to change the established principles of trust law or the rules of company law. The provisions of Companies Acts, as they apply to charities that are limited companies, are unaffected by the Bill.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield said that the Bill did not differentiate between large, medium-sized or small charities. I do not believe that the Bill needs to do that. Commissioners will receive applications from trustees requesting the exercise of discretion and they will need flexibility and the ability to decide how to deal with charities of whatever size before they make their direction.<br><br>
My hon. Friends the Members for Worcester and for Fareham expressed concern about charitable trusts controlling charitable companies and whether the commission could act compulsorily. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield was right to say the merger of a charitable trust with a charitable company cannot happen under the direction-making power. The company will still maintain its legal identity as a company and remain subject to company law.<br><br>
I agree with the case that was well put by my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe. To require commissioners to make directions would be unnecessary and would result in unwelcome extra work for the commission. The burden of that work would be great as the commission would have to ascertain the names of the trustees of every charity on the register—all 180,000 of them—and try to discover whether the same trustees were in charge of two or more different charities. That would entail examining
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0075">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
the register, combing through annual reports and writing to individual charities to find that a unifying order might not be appropriate. The commission has more important things to do.<br><br>
Committee members should note the words,
<br><blockquote><p>"for all or any of the purposes of this Act"</p></blockquote>
in section 96(5) of the 1993 Act. As has been said, that section gives the commission the power to group charities together if one charity, a subsidiary charity, is established for special purposes or in connection with another charity—in other words, in circumstances similar to those with which the Bill is intended to deal. Parliament thought it right for the commission to have discretion in the case of charities falling under section 96(5), and I am clear that it would wish the same flexibility to apply to new section 96(6). Allowing the directions of the commission to be tailored to the specific needs of each case is, I am sure, the best way of proceeding.<br><br>
I support the line taken by my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe on the other amendments and the new clause. The important point is that the commissioners should be able to consider each case individually and decide how to respond to a request to use their powers. It would be inappropriate to compel them to use their powers. The commissioners might wish to give a direction for all the parts of the 1993 Act that the amendments would exclude. It goes against the deregulatory flow of the Bill to suggest that particular parts of the 1993 Act are excepted, as amendments Nos. 3 to 6 specify.<br><br>
Part VI of the 1993 Act is particularly important. The accurate safeguarding of and accounting for the use of money by charities is and will remain of the highest importance. Accountability is preserved by the Bill, and I do not consider it necessary or appropriate to provide for the accounts of a single charity formed in pursuance of a direction of the charity commissioners, as the Bill would allow, to be treated differently from the accounts of any other single charity.<br><br>
I should like to reassure the Committee about part VI of the 1993 Act relating to accounts. It provides a much needed statutory framework for charity accounts and reports, together with their annual scrutiny by means of independent examination or audit. Part VI includes provisions for detailed regulations on such accounts and reports, subject to consultation, as my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester mentioned.<br><br>
Consultation is an important part of our procedures for refining these arrangements. We undertook a substantial consultation exercise and received many replies to the document that we published earlier this year. By the closing date of 17 May, we had received 450 questionnaires and 250 narrative comments. Of the 450 questionnaires, 71 per cent. supported the charity accounting framework overall and 13 per cent. opposed it. That is a welcome and encouraging result.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester expected me to say, it is important that the proposals strike the right balance between holding charities to account and avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy, especially in the case of small charities. Part VI was the focus of much attention on the part of the deregulation task force on charities and voluntary organisations, which reported a year ago. The Government have accepted many of its recommendations, including the raising of financial thresholds—for example, it is proposed to raise the threshold for compulsory audit from £100,000 to £250,000 gross income or total expenditure in the current or two preceding financial years—and the introduction of a new light-touch financial reporting regime, to which my hon. Friend referred, for charities whose income or expenditure does not exceed £10,000 in the current year. We believe that those are justified changes that preserve the correct balance.<br><br>
We are considering the many constructive suggestions about part VI that we received in the consultation process. Concern was expressed about the valuation of investments, the structure of accounts and the obligations on independent examiners, to name just a few. My hon. Friend the Member for Worcester mentioned the burden of requirements on smaller charities, and we are looking particularly carefully at that important aspect. We hope to reach conclusions soon, some of which may show a need for amendments to the regulations, and some simply a need for improved guidance. One decision that we have already announced is that we have delayed the intended implementation of part VI by three months until 1 March 1996—as my hon. Friend, sharp as he is, has already observed from the writing of a Home Office official. That is intended to allow additional time for people responsible for training charities and advising them upon implementation to make preparations and to work in turn with the charities that they assist.<br><br>
I hope that reassures my hon. Friend and the Committee about the appropriateness of the new accounting provisions, and that I will be excused for speaking at length to reduce discussion later this morning. I hope that it will also encourage my hon. Friends and Opposition Committee members to allow the Bill to stand as drafted.<br><br>
A footnote that we may need to discuss if any of my hon. Friends remain concerned about it relates to the unified NHS charities that will be created, because they are an important reason for the Bill's introduction. On the grounds that my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe expressed so clearly, the amendments are not helpful to the Bill and I cannot accept them or the new clause, which I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester may be persuaded to withdrawn.</span></p>

Commission might—in a future circumstance that we cannot currently predict—seek arbitrarily to impose the powers to be given under the Bill. I note that we should have the opportunity to debate that matter later as an amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield grouped with amendment No. 12 deals with it in more detail. We may return to the matter, but on the basis of the remarks of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary—than whom there are few friends more honourable, so I am sure that we are entitled to believe him—I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Most of the amendments that I tabled are probing but these are not. I seek to amend the Bill. The amendments need to be made to improve the way that the Bill works and have been urged upon me by experts in charity law, who have provided me with practical examples of how they would be of assistance. The most important is not amendment No. 17, the lead amendment, but amendment No. 19.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
If I may, I shall read out a letter written to me by a charity lawyer—a lady to whom I have referred earlier, Judith Hill of Farrer and Co.—because the issue is serious and complex and I do not trust my paraphrasing of her words to persuade the Committee of its importance. Her letter of 3 July states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The situation where one charity becomes the trustee of another is not uncommon. It often arises where a charitable trust with permanent endowment wishes to incorporate as a charitable company. Under normal circumstances if a charitable trust wishes to incorporate, it will simply transfer its entire assets and undertakings to a newly established charitable company (usually bearing the same name) with the trustees as the directors who are the 'Charity Trustees' for the purpose of the Act. The transfer will be made either under an existing power in the constitution of the charitable trust, or by a Charity Commission Scheme. It is not, however, possible to transfer permanent endowment assets in this way.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>In those circumstances, what I"—</p></blockquote>
—that is, Judith Hill—
<br><blockquote><p>"would usually advise is that the charitable trust should transfer its entire assets and undertakings other than its permanent endowment to the new charitable company which will run the day to day
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
operations of the charity. The charitable company would then be appointed as a trustee of the existing trust in place of the existing trustees."</p></blockquote>
I emphasise that sentence. She continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"The sole function of the company as trustee of the charitable trust is to hold the permanent endowment. As I have said, all the day to day activities are carried through the company in its capacity as the transferee of the undertaking. A case where this was done was the charity which owns Downe House School. This is now called the Cold Ash Trust of which the Trustees is a new incorporated charity called Downe House which runs the School.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>As you can imagine, in practice, it is very difficult for those administering the charity to keep those distinctions in mind and on the face of it the charitable company will run the whole operation and all the assets will appear to belong to the company, albeit that the permanent endowment will still be held on the terms of the original trust. When it comes to preparing the accounts (which is, I think, the thrust of the bill) it would assist enormously if both charities in these circumstances could continue to prepare their accounts as if they were one charity even after the relevant provisions of the Charities Act 1993 come into force.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The same situation often arises where a small charity which has permanent endowment property is failing for one reason or another and the trustees look round for a larger charity to take it over. This would usually be achieved simply by appointing the receiving charity a trustee of the small charity in question. This situation arose in the case of the Royal Hospital for Neurodisability. That charity is a body corporate with directors who are, of course, the charity trustees. The Hospital was approached by the John Howard Nursing Home and agreed to take over its operations. This was effected by a Charity Commission scheme which appointed the Hospital, ie. the body corporate, as the trustee of the John Howard Nursing Home. Since then, the Nursing Home has been run as part of the overall operations of the Royal Hospital. As you will see, however, technically it would not be within the Commissioners power under the sub Section as currently drafted to direct that they be treated as a single charity. The charity trustees of the Hospital are the directors of the corporate body, whereas it is the corporate body itself which is the trustee of the John Howard Nursing Home.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The same situation might arise as a result of circumstances quite beyond the control of the charities in question. For example, not long ago I was asked"—</p></blockquote>
—again, that is Judith Hall—
<br><blockquote><p>"to incorporate St Mary's School in Reigate which was previously run by charitable trust. I duly set up the corporate charity, but was unable to transfer all the assets and undertakings to the new company. One of the assets was a lease which required the consent of the lessor before it could be assigned. For one reason or another, the lessor refused to consent to the assignment. The lease therefore had to remain in the existing charitable trust while all the other assets were transferred to the company. The company was then appointed as the sole trustee of the existing charitable trust in order to hold the lease."</p></blockquote>
Those are three practicable examples of how the Bill as drafted does not adequately fulfil its purposes. Amendments Nos. 17, 18 and 19—although not amendment No. 25, in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield—set out to address that genuine concern. I repeat my comment to the Minister in private before the sitting. I hope that he will feel able to accept the three amendments, which are genuine attempts to improve the working of the Bill.<br><br>
The amendments are not just supported by one charity lawyer with reference to three examples from her caseload. The Legislation Monitoring Service for Charities, I remind the Committee, represents a distinguished and respectable group of organisations that undertake this work, such as the Association of Charity Officers, Charities Aid Foundation, Church's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0077">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
Main Committee and National Council for Voluntary Organisations. It said:
<br><blockquote><p>"These amendments amount to a backdoor amalgamation of groups of charities."</p></blockquote>
That is shorthand for what they would do—the use of the word "backdoor" was not intended to be pejorative.<br><br>
The Legislation Monitoring Service for Charities referred to the issue as it affects churches:
<br><blockquote><p>"Many trusts administered by church parishes involve very small sums of money. Those which were established in the 18th and 19th century, for the repair of church buildings or the relief of poverty, are unlikely to have been recapitalised since. The capital has consequently diminished and is likely now to amount to between £10 and £100. Similar trusts established in the 20th century tend to have been recapitalised regularly to take account of inflation, and will often have a gross income of over £100,000.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>At present, these trusts will be allocated to specific parishes. They frequently cost more to administer each year than their total worth.</p></blockquote>
Speaking as someone who has served on a parochial church council, I have encountered that practical problem and I know it to be the case. Often, those well-meaning trusts—dating back a couple of centuries—are more of an inconvenience than an asset to the workings of a parochial church council. The monitoring service continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"The parishes would like to dissolve them; the Charity Commissioners are also keen to see the numbers of these small trusts reduced. However, before any trust can be dissolved or transferred, a thorough investigation must be conducted to ensure that the move would not damage those who might benefit from the trust. This involves a lengthy verification procedure, and ultimately requires the agreement of the Charity Commissioners. It creates great administrative inconvenience."</p></blockquote>
Speaking again from practical experience, the changes in society in the intervening period make it almost impossible to meet that requirement. The monitoring service said:
<br><blockquote><p>"These amendments would enable dioceses to get round the problem by allowing the parishes to allocate to them all the trusts for similar purposes (ie, so that the church repair fund for each parish becomes the repair fund for the churches in the diocese as a whole). The funds can be more easily administered, and, if desired, more easily dissolved."</p></blockquote>
The service concluded its comments on the amendments with an important phrase that I wish to repeat clearly to the Minister and his officials:
<br><blockquote><p>"If accepted, these amendments would greatly strengthen the deregulatory impact of the Bill."</p></blockquote>
That is my position. From my experience of dealing with old charities, there is a strong case for the amendments. Old charities with a permanent endowment—not alway old, but typically so—have created problems for those other trustees of the charities. The legislation monitoring service set out the practical difficulties, especially when inflation had eroded the value of a particular endowment. That increases the need to remedy the problem.<br><br>
I hope that we now live in low inflationary times. Even at 3 per cent. a year, in 50 or so years' time many trusts will experience the same difficulty. I say in all
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
seriousness to the Under-Secretary that I would like him to say, "Yes, I think that I can accept these amendments on behalf of the Government. They should be incorporated into the Bill."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whitney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I recognise another tour de force from my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester. This time, they are not probing amendments but ones that he would wish to be incorporated into the Bill. I have been advised that the amendments would not achieve the result for which I or my hon. Friend would wish. They would allow the charity commissioners to direct, when one charity is the trustee of another charity or of more than one charity, that the two or more charities should be treated as one for the purposes of the 1993 Act.<br><br>
The second effect of the amendments would be to allow the commissioners to make a similar direction when one charity or more is a member of another charity. The third effect would be to specify that when clause 1 applies to two charities with the "same charity trustees", there would not need to be a complete identity of trustees between the two charities. Only 90 per cent. of the trustees of each charity must be the same. Some of those effects would be unfortunate, and they would not be wanted by either my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester or any other member of the Committee.<br><br>
Many charities are members of umbrella bodies, such as the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. Generally, their function is to act as representative bodies for charities with common concerns. Such organisations have members in the same sense that, for example, the National Trust has members: people or organisations subscribe to take advantage of services provided by such bodies. Many representative bodies are charities.<br><br>
The amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester, would allow the charity commissioners to direct that a representative body, together with all its members, was a single charity. Obviously, that would have some bizarre consequences, which were not intended by my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester. Therefore, I cannot support his amendments.<br><br>
Amendment No. 25, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, could take the scope of the power beyond that originally intended. The essence of the power under the Bill is that it relates to charities that have the same trustees—that is, a complete identity of trustees.<br><br>
For trustees of multiple charities with similar or overlapping, but not identical trustee bodies, there are several practical courses of action. They could maintain the status quo and register separately; with the approval of the commissioners, they could merge the charities so that they were a single charity; or they could bring their complements of trustees into line with some additions and deletions, so that they were identical, then invite the commissioners to use the power proposed in the Bill.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0078">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
The Bill makes clear who qualifies. In practice, there would be relatively few additional cases with which amendment No. 25 could deal. Certainly, those charities with nine or fewer trustees would not be assisted. Therefore, amendment No. 25 should be rejected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There have been some misapprehensions about the Bill and the amendments. It has been suggested to my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester—who has given another tour de force—that there is a question or back-door amalgamation, avoiding proper control of charitable funds. That matter is dealt with under section 74 of the 1993 Act, which provides for amalgamation.<br><br>
If charity A held funds for one purpose and charity B held other funds for a different purpose and if they were the subject of a unifying direction under the Bill, the two separate funds would still have to continue to be held for the two separate purposes. That would be a result of the general law on trusts, which would not be affected by the Bill.<br><br>
The amendment—so ably moved by my hon. Friend for Worcester—would deal with the circumstances in which one charity is the trustee of another charity when the two charities are, for most purposes, administered as one. As my hon. Friend said, that could happen when one charity—the trustee—is a company and the other is permanently endowed charity. Perhaps those charities want to merge for sound operational reasons, but a charity that is a company cannot hold permanent endowment as part of its corporate property. As was acknowledged in the letter from the lawyer whom my hon. Friend quoted, there would be a conflict between, on one hand, the company's powers under its memorandum and articles of association to expend all its property without distinguishing between capital and income and, on the other hand, the rule under charity law that states that the permanent endowment must be preserved as capital and only the income expended. The solution generally adopted in such circumstances is that the company takes the permanent endowment property on trust, not as part of its ordinary corporate property. In other words, the charitable company becomes the trustee of the charity to which the permanent endowment belongs.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Worcester wants the charity commissioners to be given power to direct that the two charities should be treated for all or any purposes of the 1993 Act as a single charity. Those purposes might, for instance, include accounting and reporting. Clearly, it is more convenient administratively for two charities that are run as one to produce a single set of annual accounts and a single annual report. In many cases, a single report and account would also give a clearer and more accurate picture of the charity's activities and financial affairs than would two separate reports and accounts. However, the information in a single set of a report and accounts must comply with the different rules.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
12.30 pm<br><br>
The amendment is unnecessary because the 1993 Act already enables the charity commissioners to direct that two charities in those circumstances be treated as one. Section 96(5) of the 1993 Act allows the commissioners to direct that an institution established for any special purposes of or in connection with a charity shall be treated as forming part of that charity. Where one charity is trustee of another, the second charity is an institution established for special purposes of or in connection with the first, so the commissioners have power to direct that the two should be treated as one for all or any purposes of the 1993 Act.<br><br>
For those reasons, I cannot support the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester because in part they are superfluous and, further, because I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe that the amendment would have the bizarre consequence to which he referred. I urge the Committee not to accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find myself in something of a dilemma, because I told the Committee earlier that I am not a lawyer, least of all a charities lawyer. I find it difficult to balance the conflicting views that have been expressed. I am persuaded by the practical arguments that I set out earlier when reading from the letter, facing named and identifiable charities and organisations. I heard from my two hon. Friends replies dealing largely with theory.<br><br>
I have to acknowledge reality. Given that my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe, whose Bill this is, and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary have expressed the views that they have, I am unlikely to carry the Committee with me in a Division, so it would not be prudent to put the amendment to a vote. However, I have given my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary a copy of the letter from Judith Hill in which there are three specific examples of practical problems that she has experienced as an expert in charity law. Perhaps his officials could respond to them in writing, to enable me to learn whether the assurances given to me are accurate.<br><br>
I do not wish to doubt my hon. Friend, but I am in a dilemma. I have heard an expert lawyer say one thing and another expert lawyer say another. Sadly, I do not feel able to judge between them. If my hon. Friend is able to give me an assurance—I think that he indicated with a nod that he is able to do so—that his officials will respond on the practical details of amendments Nos. 17, 18 and 19 and how they affect the named charities that I read into the record—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The letter from Judith Hill ignores the consequences that my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe set out in his speech, but I will certainly look carefully at the letter again and ask my officials to examine it. I will drop my hon. Friend a note, so that he can study the arguments in greater detail.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would rather push the matter to a vote, but I would clearly lose. I do not want to waste the Committee's time and, on the basis of that assurance from my hon. Friend, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 7, in page 1, line 8, after "charities", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"except those charities listed in Schedule 2,".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 8, in page 1, line 8, after "charities", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"established after the coming into force of the Charities (Amendment) Act 1995 and".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are probing and I hope that I will receive the reassurances that I seek. Amendment No. 7 gives further clarification as to which charities are affected—a theme of the debate has been exactly that. Amendment No. 8 tests—I think that I can predict what my hon. Friends will say on this point, but it is an important debate to have—whether it should apply to existing charities or only to new charities. I shall discuss the point at greater length.<br><br>
Schedule 2 of the 1933 Act, which relates to amendment No. 7, sets out charities that are exempt under that Act. There is a case for arguing that it would be inappropriate for such exempt charities to be brought under the Bill's provisions and, therefore, that it is desirable specifically to state that such charities are not included.<br><br>
I may be told by my hon. Friends that is unnecessary because it is already provided for in the 1993 Act, but I want to hear them say that and to have that assurance. The schedule of exempt charities is intriguing and includes academic institutions and also a wide range of museums, which would argue that they are educational, and the British Library Board. The Church Commissioners also feature in the schedule.<br><br>
The institutions specified in schedule 2 are known as exempt charities. They include universities, medical schools and grant-maintained schools—every grant-maintained school is an exempt charity—as well as the British, Victoria and Albert, and Science museums. Also listed are the royal botanical gardens at Kew and registered friendly societies. They are not subject to the supervisory jurisdiction of the Charity Commissioners but are subject to the jurisdiction of the court in relation to charities.<br><br>
An exempt charity is not required to be registered nor may an exempt charity register voluntarily. Exempt charities are required to keep proper books of account but they need not comply with the provisions of sections 41 to 45 of the 1993 Act, which specify the form and contents of accounts and requirements for audit and for an annual report. An exempt charity must, on the written request of any person, provide a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
copy of the latest accounts of the charity but may charge a reasonable fee for doing so. I want to hear my hon. Friend reassure me that we need not be concerned about the failure to clarify that point in his Bill.<br><br>
On amendment No. 8, I have a horrid feeling that my hon. Friend will say that, as with a previous amendment that I debated, it is a wrecking amendment because it destroys the point of the Bill. However, I shall set out the case for amendment No. 8. If all charities, including those established before the Bill becomes law, can benefit from its provision, there is potential for substantial bureaucracy, confusion and delay—a huge work load will fall on the shoulders of the charity commissioners and on national health service organisations, which are often involved with trusts.<br><br>
There are, as my hon. Friend said, 50,000 to 60,000 NHS charitable funds. That is just in the NHS—other charities elsewhere will benefit from the Bill's provisions. If they all took advantage of the Bill's provisions, an enormous amount of time would need to be spent by the charity commissioners dealing with applications. As I said, my only concern about the commission is its slowness—it is not the fastest organisation on God's earth. I worry about anything that could slow down its work again. It is making progress towards speeding up the rate at which it works. When I served on charitable trusts, we were frustrated at the time it took to get answers from the Charity Commission on important issues.<br><br>
I am nervous about putting a huge burden on the shoulders of the Charity Commission, so the other reassurance that I seek is that my hon. Friend the Minister is convinced that the Charity Commission will be able to cope with the work load of the huge number of charities that are likely to come forward for consideration under the scheme.<br><br>
It could almost be argued that the increase in bureaucracy would exceed the bureaucracy needed now for separate records in relation to each charity—particularly as we have heard that there are considerable powers available to the Charity Commission to carry out amalgamations and mergers and to treat charities sympathetically. We have seen the Government consulting on accounting procedures to simplify again the burden on charities' shoulders. We need to be sure that we are not creating a worse situation than exists and that it is not better to leave existing charities alone. It may be better to tell new charitable trusts that they can amalgamate if they want so that they know that there is an escape route, if they need it, to simplify bureaucracy in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whitney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, my hon. Friend raises an important point which I am glad to have the opportunity to air. I am sure that the same goes for my hon. Friend the Minister.<br><br>
The amendments would limit the scope of the commissioners' discretion by excluding two classes of charity—exempt charities and those coming into
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0080">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 39</span>
existence after the new measure is in force. My hon. Friend the Member for Worcester has already taken us through part of the list of charities classified and categorised as exempt in schedule 2 of the Charities Act 1993, and it is certainly a formidable list. Those charities are exempt from most of the requirements of the 1993 Act and, in particular, are not subject to supervision by the Charity Commission. The commission cannot, for example, use its investigative powers in respect of exempt charities, and it will not be required to fulfil obligations under part VI of the Act.<br><br>
Perhaps my hon. Friend thought that in tabling the amendment he was simply following through the logic of exemption by removing what might be considered pointless discretion on the part of the commissioners. However, some parts of the 1993 Act do apply to exempt charities—notably, in the present context, section 46(1), which imposes an accounting obligation on exempt charities. Therefore, exempt charities with a common administration might well wish to seek a uniting direction so that they could produce group accounts.<br><br>
I see no reason why exempt charities should not benefit from the new provision as much as registered ones, for the same reasons of work and cost. I hope that my hon. Friend will accept my argument and consider withdrawing the amendment.<br><br>
The suggestion in amendment No. 8 that the commissioners' power to issue a direction should extend only to charities established after the legislation is in place would affect the purpose of the Bill, which is to deal with present facts as well as future needs. The amendment's effect would be simple—it would prevent the commission from making unifying directions in respect of charities already in existence before the new measure comes into force. The commissioners, therefore, could deal only with future, not present, needs.<br><br>
In particular, the amendment would prevent the commissioners from dealing with the present situation in the national health service, to which my hon. Friend and I referred earlier. Once part VI of the 1993 Act comes into force, thousands upon thousands of separate charities—I can think of about 60,000—for which health service bodies are trustees will have to be separately registered and accounted for. That has all the makings of a nightmare and would entail a vast amount of unnecessary work and expense. It would be small comfort to health service trustees to know that they could apply for a direction in respect of future funds that may come under their care. There is already a problem in this respect.<br><br>
I understand my hon. Friend's point about a possible immediate increase in the work load of the Charity Commission, but we should keep this in proportion, given the element of "may" and "shall", and the fact that the power is discretionary and by application. A small amount of work will save a great deal of work in the future.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a cognate but relevant point. Does my hon. Friend have any information on the parish reviews? One element in the mix is that the discovery in parish reviews of many largely moribund charities has led to amalgamation. Some of those charities are administered effectively, if not in name, by a local solicitor, who may well have 30 or 40 such charities on his books. Presumaby, it would not be very difficult for such an exercise to be included in the terms of the Bill.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whitney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an interesting point, which takes me into a realm about which I am not confident. The point will have been noted by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and his officials, and if any significant points arise from the intervention, I am sure that he will respond, either directly or subsequently. It is certainly my impression that if a similar situation obtained for parishes, they would derive the same benefits from it as NHS charities.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Worcester suggests in amendment No. 8 that these provisions should apply only in the future. I urge him to reconsider because there is an urgent need for this measure, especially given the many very small historical legacies which remain in the national health service. It goes to the heart of the benevolent impact of what we are trying to do in the measure to retain this provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Bill will save a great deal of administrative and bureaucratic effort on the part of the Charity Commission and others. That is its purpose. There is a great deal of work currently taking place—Charity Commission teams are working with health service bodies to ensure that the process of unifying and registration is handled as efficiently and quickly as possible. I say that in response to the specific criticism of my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester who, perspicacious as ever, said that speed was required.<br><br>
In answer to the point of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent, the Bill could be used to benefit small parochial charities under the control of the same trustees. There have been no formal local reviews for some time, but we want to see these beneficial and bureaucracy time-saving provisions extended as widely as possible. The new power may rarely be required in the case of exempt charities, but I see no reason to discriminate against them or to prevent them from benefiting if they wish to do so. The commissioners certainly agree with that point. That is why, like my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe, I cannot support amendment No. 7.<br><br>
On the suggestion that only charities that come into existence after the commission has taken on this power should be subject to a unifying direction, I again support the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe. The problems with which the Bill is intended to deal exist in acute form in the health service and, no doubt, in some form in other charitable

areas. Amendment No. 8 would make it impossible for sensible relief to be given. I cannot support the amendment and hope that neither will the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had misunderstood one aspect of this part of the Bill. Amendment No. 7 has been admirably clarified by my two hon. Friends, for which I am grateful. I am obviously anxious not to wreck the purpose of the Bill, so I will not press amendment No. 8. There is, however, something that I wish to say. I may be out of date, because it is some years since I served on the board of a charity. However, I am always nervous about things that could slow down the work of the Charity Commission—a very wise organisation for which I have a high regard. It is often slightly over-burdened and finds difficulty in meeting the kind of time scales suggested by those who serve on charities.<br><br>
I hear what my hon. Friend the Minister says and accept his assurances. In the interests of making progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 9 in page 1, line 9, after "charity", insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"() The Commission shall have power to review annually any direction made under subsection (6) above.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 10, in page 1, line 9, after "charity", insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"() The Commissioners may not review any direction made under subsection (6) above until 12 months have elapsed from the making of the direction.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the amendments will provide an opportunity for the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Whitney), the promoter of the Bill, to explain how it would work.<br><br>
Amendment No. 9 would provide an important safeguard, as it might turn out that application of the provisions of the Bill to some charities might be inappropriate. The trustees might have failed to consider all the relevant factors and criteria. The charities lumped together under the Bill might be too dissimilar in their objects to be suitable for lumping together. We shall shortly debate the similarity of objects, and it might be wise to revisit the decision taken by the charity commissioners.<br><br>
A more realistic prospect is that the identities of the trustees might change. If the charities no longer had the same trustees, it would be inappropriate for them to be lumped together under the provisions of the Bill. That is a practical difficulty, to which I should like a response.<br><br>
The nature of the charities might have changed during the previous year. That is unlikely, but the possibility cannot be ruled out.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not nearly as improbable as my hon. Friend suggests. For example, within the national health service small parcels of land and haphazard buildings have been left over time to charitable trusts. If a channel tunnel rail link suddenly loomed up on the horizon, the value of that property might rocket, drastically changing the scale and nature of the charitable trust.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend provides a practical example for a theoretical construct and makes a powerful point which considerably enhances the case for the amendment. In the light of his intervention, it becomes less probing and more genuine. Perhaps there is a real issue which the amendment provides a valuable opportunity to address. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making the point, bearing in mind the fact that on the subject of the channel tunnel rail link, he speaks from personal experience.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whitney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Bitter and long.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will all be over soon, I hope.<br><br>
Amendment No. 10 is different in flavour, although it has the same general theme as amendment No. 9. The trustees must have a measure of certainty, so if there are to be reviews, they should not be too precipitate. A 12-month gap between any direction made under the Bill and the first review by the charity commissioners would provide a useful opportunity to see whether a group of charities should be treated as a single charity. Without the amendment, the annual review envisaged in amendment No. 9 could take place, in theory at least, the day after the direction had been made, which clearly would not be helpful. Amendment No. 10 is not hugely significant, but it would be a useful safeguard.<br><br>
It is interesting to note the comment of the Legislation Monitoring Service for Charities. It stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"No limitation is placed on the duration of any direction issued by the Commissioner. These amendments would ensure that directions were reviewed regularly to ensure that they remained appropriate."</p></blockquote>
That, in essence, is the reason why I tabled the amendments. I should be interested to hear my hon. Friends' response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whitney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This time, I have considerable sympathy with the thinking behind the amendments moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester, and with the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent. Circumstances may change, and the commissioners should be able to review their decisions to find out whether they are still appropriate. However, the commissioners already have the necessary power under section 90(1)(a) of the 1993 Act. Clause 90(1) is a flexible provision which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Any direction given by the Commissioners under any provision contained in this Act—
<ol>
<li>(a) may be varied or revoked by a further direction given under that provision".</li></ol></p></blockquote>

The subject of amendment No. 10 is the frequency of review. If a need for a different direction by the commissioners might arise after 12 months, why should it not arise before then? My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent gave the example of the railways and said that he would not wish to wait a specific time for such a problem to be rectified. The point is a practical one. Problems need dealing with as and when they arise and not before or after a notional date. The power to review matters already possessed by the commissioners is admirably flexible in that regard and I believe that it would be undesirable to introduce artificial rigidity in respect of the directions proposed under the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Our debate is in danger of becoming a double act between my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe and myself. My hon. Friend outlined his case well. I do not want my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester to be under a misapprehension. I, too, sympathise with the spirit of amendment No. 9, but, given the commissioners' existing power to review their directions, the amendment is not necessary As was said, amendment No. 10 would restrict the commissioners' existing powers by preventing them from reviewing their directions more frequently than once a year, which I believe to be undesirable. For those reasons, I cannot support either amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My attention has been drawn to a typographical error in amendment No. 10. I understand the arguments made against the amendment. I tabled it to explore the possibility of the commission acting unreasonably. I am entirely persuaded by those arguments and have no hesitation in saying that I shall not press the amendment.<br><br>
If I understand my hon. Friends correctly, the charity commissioners have the power to review their directions. I seem to have been given the assurances that I sought. The Bill does not build an excessive rigidity into the system, which would be particularly disadvantageous to smaller charities, especially in the circumstances highlighted by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 12, in page 1, line 9, after "charity.", insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"() The Commissioners may only exercise the power in subsection (6) above if they are satisfied the charities concerned have broadly similar objectives.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 22, in page 1, line 9, after "charity", insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"() Before making a direction under subsection (6), the Commissioners must consult the charity trustees of the charities concerned.".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 23, in page 1, line 9, after "charity", insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"() No direction may be made under subsection (6) without the consent of all the charity trustees.".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 24, in page 1, line 9, after "charity", insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"() No direction may be made under subsection (6) unless the objectives of the charities concerned are either the same or very similar.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments lie at the heart of the worries expressed to me by my constituent Mr. Mann and by the constituents of other members of the Committee about how the Bill would affect trustees of places of worship who are also trustees of other trusts. My hon. Friend the Minister dealt with that point earlier, so I shall not explore that in detail. I and the organisations that have lobbied members of the Committee will be grateful for that reassurance.<br><br>
I shall speak to amendment No. 12. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) will speak to amendments Nos. 22, 23 and 24, probably next week. The Bill confers discretionary powers on the charity commissioners. That discretion is drawn widely and any attempt to curtail it may be resisted—indeed, my hon. Friends have been doing so today. It may be desirable to group charities together for reasons other than their objects—for example, geographically to create united parishes. I understand that argument. However, it can also be argued that there is no reason why a charity administering a village hall and a medical research charitable society should be treated as a single charity on the sole ground that they happen to have the same trustees. The statement of recommended practice for charity accounting—SORP 2—refers to connected charities, which are defined as those with common, parallel or related objectives. Common trustees do not necessarily guarantee a common objective. It could be dangerous to give such a blanket power to the charity commissioners.</span></p>
