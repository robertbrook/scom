	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Home Energy Conservation Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Diana Maddock 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That, during its consideration of the Home Energy Conservation Bill, the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
Given the agreement in principle on Second Reading and given that I have been in regular contact with the Minister, I see no reason why the Committee should not proceed swiftly. Unless Committee members are difficult, I do not anticipate that we shall sit next Wednesday afternoon—I sincerely hope not. I ask for the Committee's co-operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An Energy Conservation Bill was first introduced by the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North (Mr. Dafis), and I am grateful for his continued support for the Home Energy Conservation Bill. There was wide support, so another Bill was introduced by my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith), who faced a rather different climate of opposition tactics last year. However, despite that, support for the Bill has grown—especially outside the House—which is one reason why I hope that the Bill will be successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many reasons why we are debating this important Home Energy Conservation Bill. More than 700 councils, controlled by all political parties, support it. Since Second Reading, even more councils have supported what we are trying to achieve. Few Bills have had such support from elected councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, there has been exceptional support not only from a wide range of voluntary organisations and environmental groups, which one would expect, but from many other groups which support people whom I describe as the fuel poor, and also from agencies that are responsible for looking after the elderly—Age Concern and Help the Aged, for example. The Trades Union Congress, Mencap, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, and many other groups support the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the Bill is as necessary as ever. It will impose a duty on local authorities to survey the energy efficiency of residential properties in their areas and to produce reports to enable the Secretary of State to act accordingly. We must correct the current lack of coordinated information on home energy efficiency across the country. That is widely felt, especially by environmentalists and those who work in energy conservation. Many such people believe that the main obstacle to a comprehensive national energy conservation strategy is the very fact that the measures in the Bill have not been enacted before. The Association for the Conservation of Energy has called the Bill the most important for energy conservation since the second world war. I am very grateful for such strong support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is as necessary as ever, especially for people who, as we sit here, live in cold and damp properties. That has not changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I apologise for interrupting the hon. Lady, but I must remind her that we are debating a sittings motion, and she is straying rather wide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir John. I hope that the sittings motion will be agreed, because discussions with the Government have already taken place. The Bill is different from other Bills. There are some improvements, and I have reservations about other differences. I have endeavoured to help the Minister, and I am sure that he will make his attitude clear. I hope that our deliberations will lead to an improvement in the Bill and that we are efficient in our efforts to bring about such important legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Robert B. Jones)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the whole Committee would wish to be associated with me in saying how pleased we are to serve under your chairmanship, Sir John. I have done several stints under your chairmanship in the past. I have always enjoyed the experience, and I am pleased that it is to be continued today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a first for me, because it is my first appearance in Committee as a Minister. As I look around the Committee Room, it is a bit like "This is Your Life", because my hon. Friend the Member for Blaby (Mr. Robathan) was at school with me from the age of five until I went to university. I served as parliamentary private secretary to my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley)—that was my first appointment. Later, as Chairman of the Select Committee on the Environment, I had the pleasure of having my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Clifton-Brown) as a Committee member when we considered our report on energy conservation. One of the witnesses before the Committee was my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo). Even you and I have something in common, Sir John, because you succeeded Mr. MacMillan in his parliamentary constituency, and I fought the Stockton-on-Tees seat, which is the seat that he lost before going to Bromley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In welcoming the sittings motion, I shall say a few words about the Government's approach, because it is highly relevant to the pace at which we deal with the Bill. I hope that we can proceed in a civilised way. I welcome the opportunity to consider the Bill in detail, covering as it does the most important issue of energy conservation in the home and the vital and influential role of local authorities. My personal interest in the subject is well known and of long standing, and I am delighted to be here to continue that involvement. I repeat my congratulations to the hon. Lady on bringing forward the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members who were present on Second Reading will remember that, in closing my speech, I said that the Government will approach the Bill constructively and will aim to make it better. I hope that the hon. Lady and the Committee will agree, as our debates unfold, that our approach is indeed constructive, and that the Bill will be improved as a result of the amendments—some substantive, some technical—which the Government are proposing. They may look substantial on the amendment paper, but in fact they are all constructive, and I believe that the vast majority will be welcomed by the hon. Lady and by the Committee as a whole. Examination of the new
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0297">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
clauses will show that most of them draw heavily on what is already in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to confirm that we have continued to have helpful discussions with the hon. Lady and with her advisers on the Bill. As was clear on Second Reading, there is significant agreement on the importance of energy efficiency and the role which local authorities can play. I hope that we can achieve similar agreement on at least the majority of the changes proposed in the amendments in my name. The hon. Lady has, of course, tabled her own amendments on some points, and I look forward to discussing those. But, to judge from the amendment paper—which is not always wise—the matters of contention are relatively few.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also continued our discussions of the Bill with local authority associations, which shared the Government's concerns over certain aspects of the Bill as drafted, while being generally supportive. It will clearly be important to continue that dialogue to ensure that the Bill emerges as a workable and practical tool, but one that does not impose disproportionate burdens on local authorities. I confirm that the new burdens procedure will apply to the new duties conferred by the Bill, with an appropriate transfer of resources, and I am glad that that assurance has eased some of their worries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general principles that have guided the Government in tabling amendments are those that I set out on Second Reading. We have to ensure that any new duties placed on local authorities are the minimum necessary to achieve the Bill's aims, and that, wherever possible, central and local government are given the opportunity to build upon existing procedures and information in complying with the Bill. Additional costs must be kept to the minimum, and I am sure that the Committee will agree that that is a sensible approach. It is much better that resources should be channelled into practical energy efficiency measures than into layers of bureaucracy. At the same time, we want there to be real benefits from requiring local authorities to take a systematic look at what can be done in their areas and from having information gathered together at the centre to inform and influence Government thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's concerns about the Bill, naturally, have meant that we have had to look closely at the content and purpose of the proposed energy conservation reports. Our aim has been to preserve the fundamental concept that a local authority should draw up a report setting out the measures which it considers will result in an improvement in the energy efficiency of residential accommodation in its area, but the requirement to adhere to a rigid target requiring considerable savings was difficult to accept. Not that considerable or, to use the word in my amendment, significant savings are not desirable—of course they are—but there is concern that such a target could have an adverse effect on better-performing authorities and that there may be real difficulties in adequately defining a numerical target. I am sure that we shall have considerable discussion on that matter. That is why it is appropriate that we should accept the sittings motion. It is important that consideration of the proposal should be speedy and sure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also felt that there was a need to reconsider the Secretary of State's functions in relation to the reports. Again, the general concept of the provisions as drafted was broadly in line with an approach that the Government
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
would want, but, in the Government's view, it is desirable to allow some flexibility in setting timetables for submitting reports—for example, to take into account forthcoming local government reorganisation. We have also sought to provide for reports to be updated from time to time, either at the initiative of the energy conservation authority or at the direction of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One important new element in the Bill is a provision for guidance to be issued by the Secretary of State. Again, that is a practical measure to make the Bill work better. We felt that a form of guidance would be necessary and worth while to ensure a broadly consistent approach by local authorities, to ensure that reports were presented in such a way that informed decisions could be taken by the Secretary of State, and, most important, to suggest to authorities that are not as advanced as others the steps that they really should be thinking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments in my name also provide that Northern Ireland would be included in the Bill. I am sure that that will be welcome to the Committee—many hon. Members suggested that on Second Reading. My remarks show that the Government approach the Bill constructively, and I look forward to participating in our discussions on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people will say that the Bill is not greatly different from the Energy Conservation Bill that was presented by the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed, but that is an over-simplification—many changes have occurred to take on board the various criticisms that were made, and I welcome that. This Bill will be less rigid, more clearly defined and more workable than the previous Session's Bill, although delivering the same broad aim of reducing energy consumption in the home. If the Bill emerges from Committee in the form that the Government would like, its emphasis will have shifted to complementing existing powers of central and local government rather than to imposing new duties for detailed inspections and complex plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Home Energy Conservation Bill has the potential to produce a cost-effective assessment of energy use and to increase public awareness of the problem of energy inefficiency. If it can deliver real and significant savings to the benefit of householders, local economies and the national and global environment, the nation's debt to the hon. Lady will be considerable. I look forward to participating in today's debate and in future debates with the constructive approach that the Government have already demonstrated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am delighted that the hon. Member for Christchurch has succeeded in piloting her Bill to this stage, and we shall support her in her deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is long overdue. The Opposition were sorry that the Government failed to give the appropriate support to the previous Bill, which should have become law. We are therefore anxious to set ourselves a timetable in the sittings motion that will allow us to proceed rapidly and allow the Bill to become law soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the Government intend to work constructively with the sponsors of the Bill, and we are pleased about that. He will not be surprised, however, that there will be differences of opinion on his approach to targets. The Labour party firmly believes that clear targets are essential if we are to make real progress in energy conservation and energy efficiency. We very much agree with the 30 per cent. target in the Bill, and we shall be sorry if that target cannot be retained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked of costs being kept to a minimum. We all agree with that, but we should also seek maximum benefits. It is difficult to conceive how we could do that if we are not clear about and ambitious in the targets that we set for local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, we are pleased that provision is made for Northern Ireland in the Bill. We support the sittings motion, and hope that we shall proceed rapidly in our deliberations and shall see the Bill to a successful conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The sittings motion does not set out a timetable, but the order in which the Committee will consider the clauses and amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, we have not reached that stage yet. We are on the sittings motion; the order of consideration motion comes later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we avoid thinking that we can rush consideration of the Bill, while still making reasonably rapid progress, that will help us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perhaps in order to say—although not entirely in keeping with the order of our deliberations—that anyone who thinks that we should consider proposals to drop five of the clauses from this eight-clause Bill should bear in mind that people who do not understand our proceedings may be misled and will not understand that there is in fact much agreement on the purpose and mechanisms of the Bill, although there are some areas of disagreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the action taken by a television company this morning, which showed what Westminster city council has done simply by using an aerial photograph of this building and others nearby to show how easy it is to identify heat loss. Heat loss is heat cost, which will be little comfort to people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that our sittings will be warm, but not over-warm, ventilated, but not over-drafty, and that we shall make the progress that people want us to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Yeo 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Suffolk, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the sittings motion and welcome the spirit of co-operation and constructive debate, which have so far informed the approach of all parties to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
I especially welcome my hon. Friend the Minister to the Committee. I recall his strong commitment to energy conservation matters when he was chairman of the Select Committee on the Environment. If he pursues matters with the same vigour and expertise that he showed then, fearlessly ignores the rest of Whitehall, and pays as little attention as possible to his advisers and to officials from other Departments as he did before, we shall make good progress. Incidentally, I congratulate him on getting this far with the Bill, which is further than I got last year. That is a good omen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also pay tribute to the Association for the Conservation of Energy for its expertise and persistence, and in particular to Andrew Warren, without whom the Bill would not be before the Committee now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Bill will proceed smoothly. I do not want to disrupt the spirit of all-party consensus, but I regret that some members of the Committee resisted a far more important energy conservation measure just before Christmas, when they voted against the second part of the VAT increase on domestic fuel prices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments deal with definitions. Amendment No. 1 is a technical one concerning Great Britain. It will be welcome, as regards Northern Ireland, as it provides how the Bill shall apply there. It amends the definition of energy conservation authority so as to give the responsibility for preparing reports under the Bill's provisions in each part of the United Kingdom to the authority responsible for housing. The change as regards England, Wales and Scotland is one of drafting, not of substance. "Local housing authority" for England and Wales, and "local authority" for Scotland, are the terms used in the relevant legislation to indicate the authority responsible for housing. This terminology is clear and has the advantage that it will automatically take account of changes due to local government reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Northern Ireland, it is proposed that the Northern Ireland Housing Executive should act as the energy conservation authority. The administrative arrangements for delivering local authority functions in Northern Ireland differ from those in the rest of the United Kingdom. Functions such as housing, roads, planning and social services are carried out by central Government Departments or by statutory bodies rather than by local authorities. It would be quite inappropriate to give district councils in Northern Ireland responsibility for preparing reports containing proposals for energy conservation measures for residential properties in their areas. Northern Ireland district councils do not have any housing functions and if, as proposed in the Bill, the functions of energy conservation authorities are given to local authorities responsible for housing in the rest of the United Kingdom, it seems logical that the energy conservation authority in Northern Ireland should be the Northern Ireland Housing Executive—the sole public housing authority in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Besides being responsible for energy conservation in its own stock of around 160,000 dwellings—some 27 per cent. of the total housing stock in Northern Ireland—the Housing Executive has in the past acted as an agent of the Northern Ireland Department of Economic Development in paying insulation grants to low income families in the private sector under the former homes insulation scheme. It also has a statutory duty to examine house conditions across all tenures in Northern Ireland and does so every five years by means of a house condition survey which is increasingly paying attention to the energy efficiency of stock. I mink that we can take it as read that the Housing Executive is the appropriate body to carry out the duties of an energy conservation authority in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 4 is consequential and provides that references to the area of an energy conservation authority shall be a reference to the area of the authority prescribed as the energy conservation authority, or to Northern Ireland as a whole in relation to the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. There are such references, for example, in the existing clause 2 and new clause 1, which I shall be suggesting will replace it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the amendments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's clear explanation of the amendments, and recommend that the Committee accepts them. When drawing up the Bill, we faced two difficult questions: what is a local authority,
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
and which local authorities will deal with housing? I suspect that before the Bill completes its passage, we might end up in a difficult situation. I therefore welcome the Minister's amendments, particularly the proposed inclusion of Northern Ireland. That was a difficult issue when we were drawing up the Bill. Everyone is aware of the current delicate discussions between the Government, Northern Ireland representatives and other parties. I should very much like the matter to be in the hands of local government—I am a great believer in local government—but I understand the difficulties. I hope that Northern Ireland colleagues will welcome the fact that the Bill is extended to Northern Ireland, although perhaps not in the way that they might have hoped. I recommend the amendments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment and thank my hon. Friend the Minister for including the Northern Ireland provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would ask that my hon. Friend's officials and people in the Northern Ireland Office and in the Northern Ireland civil service keep an eye on the matter. If changes are made to the responsibilities of Northern Ireland local government, I hope that the responsibility for energy conservation will be considered. Whether it continues to be in the hands of the Housing Executive or, in time, returns to local government or is given to the potential Assembly is a matter to be determined at the time. I would not want the Bill to be forgotten about. Energy conservation is not the most important item, but it is an important item and ought to be kept on the agenda.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert B. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Christchurch for her support, and to my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was one of the relatively few Select Committee Chairmen who took their responsibilities for Northern Ireland seriously when the topic Select Committees had responsibility for scrutinising policy in Northern Ireland. When I was a member of the Select Committee on the Environment under my distinguished predecessor, Sir Hugh Rossi, and when I was Chairman, we conducted several inquiries into the environment in Northern Ireland. One of my conclusions was that, at least in terms of energy efficiency, my hon. Friend and his colleagues were ahead of the rest of the United Kingdom. I have no doubt that his commitment to energy conservation was one of the reasons for that. He argues, logically, that the function should follow housing responsibility, and that must be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The logic of the Government's amendment is that if a body—a term that I use to describe the Housing Executive at the moment—has responsibility for monitoring stock condition and for paying grants from time to time, as well as landlord functions, and such responsibilities were then transferred to another body, whether that be local government or another organisation, it would be logical for energy conservation responsibilities to go with them. We shall bear that in mind, should any such changes occur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned that the Northern Ireland Office, through the Housing Executive, had already done much work in this context. I understand that the Northern Ireland Housing Executive would not be considering the private sector but would deal with only its own stock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0300">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, then, I should like the Minister to clarify that matter. Secondly, because so much work has already been and it seems that audits have been carried out, will the Minister give an estimate of the potential for targeting energy savings through the Housing Executive on its own stock?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made it clear in my opening remarks that the Housing Executive has a statutory duty to examine housing conditions across the province. That is not only the stock which is owned by the Housing Executive but also private sector stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, in terms of the grand design of developing strategies—something that we have insisted that local authorities in the United Kingdom do through the housing investment programme—the Housing Executive is the relevant body. I am satisfied that the issue fits neatly into the comparability package whereby relevant aspects of Northern Ireland are compared with local authorities in the rest of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to potential, I could say to the hon. Lady, as I did in a previous debate that there is considerable potential, but one does not know precisely how much. The reason for having some extension is presumably so that we can get the figures and then set targets. Much housing in Northern Ireland is relatively new. It is one of the great successes of the Housing Executive and is more energy-efficient, by and large, than older housing, so it is probably more important to concentrate on the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cirencester and Tewkesbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I warmly welcome the Bill. On the amendment, it is worth putting on record, to reinforce what my hon. Friend the Minister has said, that during our Select Committee hearing on energy conservation we visited Belfast and learned that the Northern Ireland Housing Executive had entirely refurbished its older stock of public housing with energy conservation in mind. We then travelled to Glasgow and found a marked contrast between houses that had had money spent on them in terms of energy conservation measures and some pretty dreadful tenement blocks. In one case, tenants were spending £20 a week on their energy bills, yet the temperature inside in winter was colder than that outside. I hope that the Bill will ratchet up the standard of authorities which are worst on energy conservation to the standard of the best.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Ms Ruddock) is that significant improvement can still be achieved in Northern Ireland. Many people have had to heat their homes with coal fires. In private sector housing, most of those fires have not been replaced or upgraded. So, whether the reduction reaches the 30 per cent. proposed in the Bill or the significant improvement proposed in one of the amendments, it is still of significant benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert B. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 10, leave out from "means" to end of line 11 and insert

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>Amendment No. 3 in page 1, line 12, leave out from beginning to end of line 26 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"'energy conservation measures' includes information, education, promotion, making grants and loans and carrying out works.".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>Amendment (a) to the proposed amendment, in line 1, after "promotion,", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"giving advice and assistance to businesses regarding ways in which they might assist with energy conservation in residential accommodation,".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are already making constructive progress and I welcome that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is, like that relating to the definition of "energy conservation authority", a technical amendment to align the terminology used in the Bill as closely as possible with that used in other legislation. There are many definitions of "accommodation" or "dwelling-house", or various similar terms, in a range of statutes and there are of course variants to cover differences in Scots and English law. The definition in the amendment is the one that I am advised is modelled on housing law. It is clear and simple and should not give rise to unnecessary doubt, as might occur in introducing a new definition in what is an already crowded field. The hon. Member for Christchurch should have no difficulty with that. In fact, during one of our discussions, she said that she too had had a problem with the number of definitions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 3 provides an alternative name and definition for what are called "measures and arrangements" in clause 1. The hon. Member for Christchurch has proposed an amendment to the amendment. The use of the term "energy conservation measures" seems to us to describe more accurately than "measures and arrangements" what local authorities are to identify in their reports. It is "measures" that is the more active part of the terminology of the Bill and that which we have sought to preserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Precisely because "energy conservation measures" are what an authority must identify in its report prepared under the Bill, the definition is of some significance. But I should stress to the Committee that the definition in the amendment is, like the definition already in the Bill, not exhaustive. It sets out only certain matters which are included within that definition for the purposes of the Bill. A local authority will be free to consider and to propose in its report any other energy conservation measures which it thinks relevant and worthwhile.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition proposed in amendment No. 3 is shorter and simpler than that which it would replace, but covers essentially the same ground. Information, education and promotion are key elements. Local authorities, with their knowledge of the population of their areas and various means of communication with them, are particularly well placed to promote the energy efficiency message in an imaginative and positive way. They will have links with the business sector, schools and colleges, community groups and directly with their residents through newspapers or other means. Of course, many authorities already take the sort of approach that we wish to see and I hope that the Bill will encourage others to follow the practice of the best. Information is an area where authorities will be able to draw on the material produced
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0301">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
by the Energy Efficiency Office in my Department and on the campaigns, such as the "wasting energy costs the earth" initiative, which it runs. The second element in the definition, the making of grants and loans, covers initiatives such as the home energy efficiency scheme. The third element, the carrying out of works, is, I think, self-explanatory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Christchurch seeks to add a reference to giving advice and assistance to businesses regarding ways in which they might assist with energy conservation in residential accommodation. We had not included an express reference to advice to businesses in the amended definition because we did not think one was needed. Information, education and promotion relating to energy conservation in residential accommodation, which are referred to in amendment No. 3, can be directed at anyone, including a business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will agree that the amended definition is suitably comprehensive, subject to any further consideration of the point that the Committee may wish to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the Government amendments, although we feel that they are a little unnecessary. The Minister is right to try and get a definition from the original Bill of "residential homes". I was at one stage given a very long definition of that and I am pleased that we have now reached agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to raise one issue with the Minister—one that he probably knew I would raise as I have spoken to him about it previously. I should be grateful if he would clarify for me—partly because of the nature of my constituency—exactly where mobile or park homes would fit into the definition. Many people who live in park homes are elderly and I have had one or two letters from people who are a little worried about how they will fare in that regard, particularly because they have flat roofs, which I understand is one of the problems in the definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is right in saying that in the amendment the Government have largely rewritten and included in one clause everything that already existed. However, not to mention businesses specifically would detract from its efficacy at local government level. It is important to send out a message that the Bill will not be just for the benefit of local councils, but that it provides a basis on which councils will work with the local community. I was a little surprised that the Minister did not want to include that in the amendment. As he said, the measures listed are not compulsory or all-inclusive, but they do convey an important message.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To sum up, we are happy to accept, in the spirit of cooperation that has prevailed, the two Government amendments, but it is important that my amendment also be agreed to. If we specifically exclude co-operation between councils and the private sector, we shall be sending the wrong message. I hope that I have the support of the Committee on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the hon. Member for Christchurch. The Minister seems to have said that he has provided an all-inclusive definition and has argued that, if we accept that, work with businesses is possible. I say to him simply that if such work with businesses is possible, there is surely no reason to resist the amendment proposed
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
by the hon. Lady. In all political parties, it is now the fashion to encourage partnership between the public and private sectors. We have had a long history of local authorities not addressing themselves to the needs and concerns of the private sector in relation to the delivery of services to local people. Those partnerships are bearing some fruit. Many Labour authorities have a very good working partnership with the private sector which includes energy efficiency and conservation matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister to express his generosity in a spirit of co-operation and recognise that, as he has already said that there is no reason to resist, there should be positive discrimination in favour of working with businesses. We all know that that will be productive and useful in the local economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Simpson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will adopt a relaxed approach to the amendments. The partnership approach is important. We want to apply a framework not only to the best but to the worst local authorities. Nothing can be lost and much can be gained by making specific reference to partnership or linking arrangements between local authorities and the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have learnt an important lesson during the past few years. Although it has always been possible to advise businesses and to work in conjunction with the private sector, a large number of authorities have not done so. Only when specific advice was given did the partnerships become real. This is not a point of political contention but of good practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Nottingham, I know that dialogues between the local authority and the private sector have been productive in ways that neither side expected. People in the local authority found themselves not only giving advice but receiving it from those delivering services on the ground. There was a changing agenda of public concerns which made it appropriate for the private sector to think in wider terms than their own short-term financial interest. That partnership has been productive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sadly, other authorities in Nottingham have not gone down that path, either in terms of energy conservation or partnerships, so specific reference to those crucial issues in the Bill would be immensely helpful in reinforcing the message that we all want to be sent out from the House. We seem to be in a win-win scenario. By accepting the amendments we could enhance the positive message that we all want to send out. That is why we should be specific about encouraging links with the business sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 3 has elegance. The reduction in the number of words from the original clause is welcome. In the disputed part, highlighted by the hon. Member for Christchurch, the key words are "advice" and "assistance" rather than "businesses". The amendment incorporates the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"information, education, promotion, making grants and loans and carrying out works".</p></blockquote>
If those words add something, they are worth keeping in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Simpson) spoke about the importance of partnership. The whole Committee would accept that, but the word "partnership" is not in the amendment. However the Committee decides today, I hope that the Bill's promoter
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0302">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
and the Minister and his advisers can get together. I suspect that there is a more elegant way of achieving what the Committee wants—to ensure that businesses are not left out of the minds of those in the energy conservation authority. If the words "advice" and "assistance" add anything, the Minister might consider whether they could be either left in or put into statute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that local authorities will be imaginative about the advice, guidance and partnerships that they will seek when the Bill is passed. I hope that the right message will be put across everywhere, not just in the business community. I am thinking of schools, youth clubs, social clubs and in-house magazines circulated in industry. There seems to be a flourishing trade in such magazines, so I hope that they can be put to good use by providing advice and guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Partnerships have been formed between local authorities and business, mostly on the economic front to look at ways of regenerating areas and attracting industry into the area to create jobs. Such partnerships have been extremely fruitful. In Ribble Valley, enterprise agencies have worked in such partnerships and have tried to support one another. I hope that if the amendments are accepted local authorities will continue to be imaginative and will use the structures that they have already set up to get the energy conservation message across.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was particularly interested to hear my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham use the slogan "heat loss is a heat cost", because there is a cost. We must ensure that people fully appreciate the cost involved. If we could get that message spread as widely as possible, people who are loath to spend their own money on energy conservation measures that they do not consider important or urgent might reconsider their priorities and realise that if they spent some money initially on such measures they would make a financial saving in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the Minister's amendment would encapsulate business, but if it is accepted I hope that local authorities, with guidance, will be encouraged to look far wider than just businesses and will try to reach as many organisations as they possibly can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend's two amendments, but I urge him to consider as sympathetically as he can the amendment to his amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Christchurch. I am sure that the Committee wants to encourage local authorities to work constructively with businesses to assist energy conservation. I welcome the enthusiasm of Opposition Members for local authorities to work with the private sector. Some of us can remember a time when it was not quite thus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is what wording in the Bill will achieve that objective. Nothing much would be lost by including wording along the lines of the hon. Lady's amendment, although my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham has, as ever, personably suggested that there might be a more elegant phrase that would achieve the same objective. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will reassure us that it is his intention that local authorities should work in this way. It has already been pointed out that one reason why
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
we have to have the Bill is that many local authorities are not matching the practice of the best. Such concerns make me sympathetic to the amendment to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert B. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The one thing that is clear from the debate is that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee are united in wanting to see partnerships with business. But I do not think that those partnerships should be exclusive, nor does that lie behind the hon. Lady's amendment or the comments made by hon. Members. My hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) hit the nail on the head when he suggested that a number of organisations could also co-operate in this partnership. He mentioned schools, youth clubs and magazines, to which I would add the voluntary sector, which has a key role in getting messages across and acting as a conduit for information to those in the community who could benefit from energy conservation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of Parliament attend functions at the end of which they get to move the vote of thanks. We may select Mr. Smith or Mrs. Jones from the list and, although it is not wrong to say thank you to them for what they have done, if we are not careful we may imply that others have not done as much or are not as important. All those groups are of critical importance in taking the strategy forward. My hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South suggested sensibly that the matter should be covered by guidance and encouragement, just as we insist that local authorities show in their housing investment programme how they have progressed their energy efficiency strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, local authorities can be good, bad or indifferent in that regard. The good ones are more numerous than is sometimes thought, because they do not sing their achievements from the rooftops. My hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South might be interested to know that I have written to the leaders, the housing chairmen and chief housing officers of the local authorities that I consider to be somewhat less successful than others. I invited them to come to a good-practice seminar, at which we can exchange information about what the best local authorities are doing and explore new ideas about how matters can be taken forward. Virtually all the people to whom I wrote have accepted that invitation. That is part of the guidance and encouragement of which I spoke. Perhaps the hon. Member for Nottingham, South had a local point in mind, as one of the authorities proving most difficult in these matters is in his area. However, even that authority went out of its way to stress some of the things that it is doing, although it did not participate in the usual processes. I think that that authority wanted to show its independence. I do not think that it is unconcerned about energy efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure can be directed at businesses without including that provision on the face of the Bill. Such an inclusion would carry the temptation to cover just about everyone else as well. That is not the right way to go, but if members of the Committee have strong feelings about the matter, I should be happy to reconsider it and decide whether an appropriate amendment should be tabled later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford raised the question of mobile homes. The hon. Lady is a member of the all-party mobile homes group, whom I met yesterday to talk about many other issues. I have a lot of sympathy with the hon. Lady's point. In my constituency, there is a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0303">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
mobile homes site with about 80 mobile homes on it. Observation alone shows that some of them are pretty energy inefficient. Quite a number of the people living in those homes would benefit from energy efficiency measures. I promised after the meeting that I would look into the question of qualification for the home energy efficiency scheme. I can reassure the hon. Lady and other hon. Members that such homes are included in the HEES.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mobile and park homes are not at present included in the definition that I have proposed. I promise that I shall consider how to plug that small hole. I have no objection in principle to such homes being covered. It seems only right and proper that they should be included in the local authority's strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the point about businesses, I hope that the hon. Member for Christchurch will understand my motivation in resisting the amendment, and my willingness, if she feels very strongly about the matter, to have another look at it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his support and explanations. Also, I thank the hon. Member for Suffolk, South for his support on businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the Minister's intention that the Bill should apply to businesses, but Ministers' intentions do not make law. Reluctant authorities could argue that businesses are not covered by the Bill, which deals only with residential properties. It is important that we make it clear that we are in favour of including businesses as well. As others have said, hon. Members from both sides of the Committee want local government to work with businesses. On the point of principle, there is no argument between us. Therefore, mere is no reason why we cannot all support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert B. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems that the hon. Lady feels strongly about the issue. In the light of what my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham said about elegance, I wonder whether she would allow me to return to the

	<li>The report shall include—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>an assessment of the cost of the energy conservation measures set out in it,</li>
	<li>an assessment of the extent to which carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere would be decreased as a result of those measures, and</li>

	<li>such other matters as it considers appropriate.</li></ol>
	<li>An energy conservation authority may in preparing the report consult such persons as it considers appropriate.</li>

	<p>And the following amendments thereto: (a), in line 4, leave out from "considers' to end of line 6 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"are needed to achieve overall energy savings of 25 per cent. against current consumption for the heating and lighting of residential accommodation in its area.".</p></blockquote></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"local energy conservation reports in relation to residential accommodation".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>If clause 2 is disagreed to, that would suggest the possible consequence that, in due course, clause 3 would also be disagreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I briefly remind the Committee what clause 2 is about. I emphasise again that many previous energy conservation proposals were criticised for having too many "shalls" and not enough "mays". As was pointed out on Second Reading, we have acted constructively to address those problems. That is laid out in clauses 2 and 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 is the hub of the Bill. It sets out the duty of energy conservation authorities. They are to assess the energy efficiency of their properties and to take reasonable steps to assess potential improvements in energy efficiency in other residential properties in their areas. I was especially pleased that that point was made clear in the case of Northern Ireland as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have rewritten the whole clause, rather than just renumbered it, and two important subjects are omitted. The procedure for amending the new clause is somewhat convoluted, and it is made even more difficult because we are supposed to be discussing clause 2, but the new clause 1 includes clause 3, which we intend to discuss later. No doubt, Sir John, if we get into a muddle and step out of line, you will put us in order. I hope that you will be lenient with us, as the procedure is extremely difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3, which is part of new clause 1, encapsulates many of our original proposals, although changes have been made. We are concerned about two main changes, in particular about targets. It is vital that we have a concrete target in the Bill for the reduction of energy consumption, which local authorities can aim at. I listened with interest as the Minister talked about Northern Ireland and explained that the way matters proceeded there would be important because he wanted to target. I therefore hope that he will take our amendments seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government subscribe to the principle of targets. In making a corporate commitment, the Government seek to persuade company directors to develop an energy efficiency strategy and to make particular savings. More than 16,000 organisations have signed up to the Bill, and there is no reason why local government cannot do the same. The Government themselves are committed to a 15 per cent. reduction in energy consumption in their estate in the five years between March 1991 and 1996. Westminster city council already uses aerial infra-red photographs, and other organisations will be doing so in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be more specific than the word "significant". The Government use that word when they talk about savings. However, that is too vague. Many authorities are lagging behind and we need to urge on them the target that they should aim for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people believe that 30 per cent. would be a realistic target, and I shall be pilloried by people outside the House—indeed, I am already being pilloried—for even contemplating lowering the target to 25 per cent. Friends of the Earth has already encouraged councils to sign up to its climate resolution, which commits them to targeting energy savings of 30 per cent. by 2005. Nineteen councils of all political complexions have already signed up to that. As was mentioned on Second Reading and again today, more than 700 locally elected councils have passed motions of support for the various incarnations of the Home Energy Conservation Bill, in which there has always been a commitment to a target of 30 per cent. Other clauses would give the Minister the flexibility to allow people who are concerned about the target to deal with it. There is, therefore, no reason why our very reasonable lowering of the target to 25 per cent. should not be accepted by the Government. Many people are sad that we have done that and would prefer the target to remain at 30 per cent., however.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One argument that has been advanced is that many authorities such as Newark and Sherwood district council have made terrific strides in energy conservation and that the Bill would be unfair on them. However, the Minister will have flexibility, and, surprisingly, it is the councils that have done the most already which seem to be the most enthusiastic about the Bill and have signed up to the 30 per cent. target in the Friends of the Earth agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Newark and Sherwood district council has an exemplary record on energy conservation and has considered whether it could achieve a 30 per cent. saving in its current circumstances. One might think that, having done all that it has done, it would be difficult for it to achieve that as well. However, in a letter yesterday, the chief architect and the energy manager of Newark and Sherwood district council, Mr. David Pickles, said
	<br><blockquote><p>"For Newark and Sherwood the 30 per cent. C0	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> target is deliverable",</p></blockquote>
and he set a 15-year time scale on it—which may help the Minister—and a 30 per cent. target for energy reduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Newark and Sherwood has a demonstration project, which is called Boughton Energy Village 2001. That is on course to deliver a 60 per cent. reduction in C0	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> in just 13 years. Across the district, the chief architect believes that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0305">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
energy use can be cut by more than half and that that is practically achievable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1990, the Building Research Establishment produced a document entitled "Energy Use in buildings and carbon dioxide emissions". It concluded that energy savings of 40 per cent. were possible and that savings of 29 per cent. would be cost-effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By international standards, 30 per cent. energy savings are not an unrealistic hope. Germany has a target reduction of 25 to 30 per cent. by 2005 as part of its efforts towards the framework convention on climate change which was agreed at the Rio summit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1989, a few years before the Rio summit, the Government themselves recognised the potential for 30 per cent. energy savings in domestic properties. According to the Government's submission to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Good housekeeping and better energy management could improve UK energy efficiency by 10 per cent., 'retrofit' investments with a payback period of around two years could provide a further 10 per cent. improvement, and yet another 10 per cent. saving could follow from investments that had a payback period of from two and five years."</p></blockquote>
The Government thus concluded that 30 per cent. savings could be achieved purely by better management and investment, and that that could be justified on economic grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear to me and to many members of the Committee that 30 per cent. energy savings are achievable, so why are we proposing only 25 per cent? The reason is a real effort to reach an accommodation with the Government on this issue. People outside do not think that it is sufficient to include the word "significant"; it is vital that we have a concrete target.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's earlier words about Northern Ireland showed that he believes that targets are important. The best councils tell me that they want to retain the targets and that they would not be impossible to achieve. As I have said, the Minister has sufficient flexibility to help those councils that might be having problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that all members of the Committee are totally convinced that we should drop the target to 25 per cent.—on Second Reading, some hon. Members spoke in favour of 30 per cent. But we have no means of knowing what some councils will think they are aspiring to unless we set a target. The Bill will lose its point unless it contains targets; its whole point is to enable us to have a national energy efficiency strategy and to ensure that councils that have already done good work and the slightly more recalcitrant councils know what to aim for and have a plan. We would then have a realistic national energy strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister will say that some local government organisations are worried about the matter, but I think that he has the ability to reassure them, given the flexibility that the Bill gives him. I hope that he knows that I, along with many members of the Committee and all the supporting organisations as well as the councils, believe that it is vital for councils to know what they are aiming for. I hope that the Committee will push that point and that the Minister will be favourable to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gary Waller 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Keighley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In recent years, the benefits that can be achieved by setting targets have been well established. For example, in the Department of
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
Health, the targets set out in "The Health of the Nation" have become the yardstick against which improvements in people's general health have been measured. Considerable benefits have been achieved by persuading people to change their behaviour and by initiating screening programmes. Few people in that area disagree that considerable advances have been made by adopting that approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, the Department of Transport set targets for the reduction of casualties by the end of the century. The methods involved included the enforcement of requirements for safer cars, and the introduction of local highway engineering schemes. Initial scepticism at that approach has given way to agreement about its suitability among most commentators as casualties have been reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, neither of those targets was set out in legislation. I am a little worried about whether a target should be written into the Bill in the way proposed by the hon. Member for Christchurch. I agree that a target is necessary to make progress, but the Bill is not a one-off measure. It should be the starting gun for a series of measures that will constitute a rolling programme. Local authorities, having got near the proposed 30 per cent. figure, may not know how to proceed. An alternative may be to provide for the Secretary of State to introduce a statutory instrument, which can be reviewed from time to time, setting out a target for a particular period. When that target is reached, a further review can be held and a new target established by means of another statutory instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More progress could be made over a period in that way than by simply adopting the rigid approach encapsulated in the Bill. However, I agree with the hon. Member for Christchurch that a commitment should be made at the outset that there should be a target, to be achieved over a certain period, and that 25 to 30 per cent. is probably an appropriate figure. I am worried that the mechanism in the Bill is a little too rigid and that it does not allow for the need to ensure that the process continues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cynog Dans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion and Pembroke, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is comforting for me to have you in the Chair, Sir John. You may recall that you chaired the first Committee of which I was a member, and you were very helpful at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the Government now support the Bill and will enable it to become an Act. However, I am worried by the proposal to drop targets from the face of the Bill. Those targets are essential to the Bill's success. We must bear in mind the fact that it is customary to enshrine targets in environmental legislation, especially in relation to the recycling targets that local authorities are required to reach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Environmental agreements and legislation that lack targets are pretty well useless. That is true of national or state legislation and of international agreements. The Bill belongs in the context of the Rio climate change convention agreements, which set the target of stabilisation of C0	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions by the year 2000 at 1990 levels. It is certain that we shall have to set further international targets which will have to be reflected in state policy. Moreover, current targets are insufficient. Stabilisation at 1990 levels by the year 2000 is a grossly inadequate target. We all know that we need global
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0306">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
reductions of 60 per cent., which requires reductions in developed countries of up to 90 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that the Government have made proposals about air quality, Their recently published document sets out targets there for local authorities to reach. So it would be nonsensical—I go that far—to pass the Bill without proper targets. A target of 30 per cent. is not in the least bit too high. The proposal of the hon. Member for Christchurch is to reduce the requirement to 25 per cent., but that is not good enough. We must be ambitious. A 30 per cent. target is the absolute minimum. We have already heard that Newark and Sherwood council could achieve overall reductions in CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions of up to 50 per cent. It is among the most progressive authorities. The Bill provides flexibility for local authorities that have done well already, so they have extra time to achieve even more ambitious targets. No one is suggesting any absolute physical barrier to reducing C0	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions in domestic property. It is generally accepted that a far greater reduction than 30 per cent. is feasible. It is a question of how and over what period of time local authorities can achieve their targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been involved in the debate over this Bill from the beginning. I have observed how tremendous support and consensus has gradually built up. Many organisations and many people have helped to achieve that. Such support has been inseparable from the idea of targets. The intense activity of so many organisations would not have occurred were it not for the idea of targets and the specific figure of 30 per cent. for the top target.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Organisations have become enthused by the Bill and enthused, in the process, by the whole question of energy efficiency and its environmental, social and health implications. Those organisations would feel betrayed if targets were dropped from the Bill or if the target level were lowered. We simply must have targets—25 per cent., okay; the hon. Lady's amendment may help the Minister, but anything less than that would be a betrayal. The Government have done a great deal, through the good offices of the Minister, to repair their reputation over recent weeks. I fear that the Government will find themselves back at square one in the public's perception if they do not agree to a target in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has already been stated that a number of organisations, including many local authorities such as my own support the Bill and its main thrust. I have also received many letters from parish councils in my constituency, asking me to support the Bill, so I am delighted to do so. Many other organisations have also been mentioned, some of which are in the private sector, and quite a number are in the voluntary sector. My hon. Friend the Minister hoped that, when the Bill is enacted, many voluntary organisations will disseminate the information. We all meet people in our surgeries, so we, too, can play our part in getting information across to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome new clause 1. Assessment of jobs is important, because the measure will create jobs throughout the country and not just in one part of it. I represent a constituency in the north-west of England, and I know that many houses will benefit from the work that needs to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
It was said that an assessment should be made of the average savings in fuel bills in different types of households and for different types of accommodation. In rural areas it is vital to show people who live in different types of accommodation the savings that can be made. It will not be easy to make some of the savings on older properties, but assistance must be given. Special attention must be paid to rural houses that have been constructed perhaps 200 or 300 years ago. The hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North will know that, in parts of Wales, there are houses that were built 200 or 300 years ago or more, and special attention would have to be paid to see how they could benefit from energy conservation measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted to say that, while travelling around my constituency two weeks ago, I came upon a newly built housing development that was selling the concept of energy conservation as part of the package to try to attract people to buy. I pulled off the road to look at those houses, but unfortunately, they were just outside my financial reach. I chatted to the developer and he was able to demonstrate the savings that can be achieved in new build. It is attractive to people in the long term to be shown how much savings can be made and how much they will pay for fuel if energy conservation measures are included at the start of planning, construction and development. It is far cheaper to do that at the construction and development stage than later on. I congratulate the developer in Chipping on using energy conservation as a magnet to draw people in to look at those houses. I wish him and other developers well in promoting energy conservation as a worthwhile measure in itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be a national campaign to disseminate information so that as many people as possible know about energy conservation. We desperately need to publicise our objectives, irrespective of targets. After the recent fall of snow, it was obvious that some houses were far more energy efficient than others. Snow disappeared much sooner on some houses than on others. Snow made the problem throughout the country more visible. We need to raise the profile of energy conservation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should get the message across at an early stage. When I talk to young people in schools, they show greater awareness of energy conservative than some older people, including myself. We need to target children in schools because they are an audience who are prepared to listen and to hear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Eltham mentioned something that he saw on television. Television is the medium for getting any message across. Irrespective of whether businesses are included in the legislation when enacted, I hope that we can attract television companies to become involved in the national campaign to get across to people they type of measures that they could take to make their homes far more energy efficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, I spoke about the importance of targets. I said that the 30 per cent. target was useful—targets must be useful. If people go on diets, they do not normally say, "I want to make a significant improvement in my weight loss," they say, "I want to lose a stone," or whatever the weight may happen to be, so that at least they know where they start. Hopefully, that will be where they finish, although that is not always the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0307">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert B. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In common with some of my colleagues, I am trying that very process. I set my own targets, which is probably the most relevant consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I hope that the targets are realistic and that my hon. Friend the Minister will be able to achieve them in a short time within his own set constraints. The same principle applies to the Government. Although we never take any notice of polls, we know that they currently show that we are, perhaps, not as popular as we might want to be or should be. Again, we do not say that we want to make significant improvements—although, of course, we shall do so, as we draw nearer to the general election—but we should set targets nationally and in our constituencies. Therefore, a target is useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, we need flexibility. It has already been mentioned that several local authorities have made great gains in promoting energy conservation in their areas, and we certainly do not want to hit those which have already achieved best practice. We need flexibility in the system so that they are not hit. Many local authorities will be keen in any event to achieve more than any target that we set. Therefore, if we decide to include a target, we need to ensure that that will act not as a ceiling on what local authorities should do but as a floor through which they do not drop. I hope that we shall be able to examine the matter again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want significant improvements—if we use that terminology—to mean that organisations which are not so keen on energy conservation, which will always put it at the bottom of any priority list, will not escape from the measures that we want them to achieve. We do not want to penalise those which have done a lot, but, at the same time, we do not want to allow those which have done nothing to get away with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simpson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support new clause 1, but I want specifically to address the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Christchurch. I was one of the people to whom she referred when she said that she had already walked into a fair amount of criticism about going from a 30 per cent. commitment to a 25 per cent. commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is relatively simple, and it was made very clear by the hon. Member for Ribble Valley. Without targets, we have no substance. One of the more welcome changes to issues which affect public policies and public life is that we set standards. If we tried, during a debate on pollution, to push through legislation which simply encourages significant improvements in pollution control, we would be laughed out of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We expect to be judged on what we deliver,—an expectation that is shared by society. We are moving towards being judged not only on the spirit behind legislation but on whether it delivers change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly set out targets are an essential cornerstone of the Bill, and for it to lack a declared set of standards would render it almost worthless. All the best authorities which are doing such work would continue in the same way, without the need for legislation, but those which have been dragging their feet would continue to do so, because they would know that they could shelter behind
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
the vagueness of the phrase "significant improvements". That would not help the general consensus, which desires that the Bill be put on the statute book. If it is to be enacted, it must contain targets that set standards for the worst authorities around the country. We hope that the best authorities would find leeway whereby, if they faced difficulties, they could gain recognition for the work that they had already done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to record that, as I understand it, the only authority that said that it would find it difficult to meet the original proposal of a 30 per cent. reduction was Kirklees, an authority which has carried out a great amount of work on energy conservation over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other aspects of the Bill would allow for built-in flexibility, which would show that we do not want to focus pressure and attention on the best performers; rather, it would give flexibility to authorities which have already gone a long way toward increasing energy efficiency. We would set a benchmark for the authorities that were not performing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to agree with some of the comments made by the hon. Member for Keighley (Mr. Waller). I can understand his reservations about whether it is important to set out a specific target now and thus to cast it in tablets of stone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is the first in a series of rafts of legislation that we must expect in the next five to 10 years. Nothing will stop us doing more, but it is important to set down the basis from which we start out. I anticipate that we shall see additional changes over the next decade, possibly introduced by the Government, which will move us from talking about relative savings to absolute standards—we have moved in exactly the same way with regard to pollution control. We are likely to become much more rigorous in terms of energy efficiency audits and the way in which they apply across the whole of society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely that it is important that we now establish a target which is achievable and which we aim to reach in the future. I wonder, however, whether it is the right strategy to assume that new legislation will be introduced in future. To say that the Bill will be of utility for a long time to come, as I hope, would provide for the Secretary of State to introduce fresh targets that would update the existing ones. Perhaps, at the end of the century, when I hope that we will have achieved those targets, further targets can be established within the context of the measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simpson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that would be extremely helpful. It would not surprise me if all members of the Committee welcomed a proposal from the Minister to do precisely that; however, it would not need to be in place of a defined target as a starting point. It ought to be seen as a supplement. Indeed, that is how we should view the Bill: the starting point of our procedures must be the setting of a bottom line because against that the worst performing authorities will, I hope, be asked to demonstrate that they have achieved the targets. That would require those authorities to carry out auditing which measures their current performance and sets out a programme of work to meet those defined targets. If the Minister has required flexibility built into the Bill, allowing him to raise the targets from time to time, that would also be a very desirable addition.

	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
The bottom line for the Committee and for the Bill is a simple one: unless we set a minimum target, large numbers of authorities which have disregarded environmental responsibilities will continue to disregard them. I would have preferred to see the words "at least" alongside the proposed 25 per cent., so that a presumption is built into the wording that that figure was the start and not the end. However, I am sure that if the Minister sees fit to make further amendments to that, it would be welcomed by the best authorities. I am sure that hon. Members will draw considerable support from the response of Newark and Sherwood. If the best of the performers are saying that with a little help and a little imagination they could set themselves targets of 50 per cent., the refusal of the Committee to endorse the setting of a target of half that amount for everyone else would be a woeful betrayal of the spirit in which the Bill was presented and of the aspirations of the whole country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Robathan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blaby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Bill and the opportunity to speak on it. I sat on the Committee of the Energy Conservation Bill, put forward by the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed; indeed, I was a sponsor of it. The Bill underlines something that we all support. It is strange that I find myself in support of the hon. Member for Nottingham, South: there is widespread concern about the waste of energy but that needs to be translated into action. Both the district councils in my constituency, Blaby and Harborough, have written to me this year, as they wrote to me last year, to encourage me to support the Bill. I would have done so anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also support what the hon. Member for Nottingham, South said about targets. Without a target, the legislation is useless—a meaningless piece of flannel. We all support the issues in general but we must lead the debate beyond that; it has to be more than a bureaucratic exercise and more than simply, to quote the Bill, "promotion, education and persuasion". That is why targets are so important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a parliamentarian, I think that we can view the Bill as a measure that will lead public opinion away from the vague feeling that energy conservation is a good thing and towards positive action. Everyone knows that it is a good thing: they do not need to be told. The "save it" campaign has been running since I was at school; everyone knows about "saving it", but if one wanders around the House late at night, one will see a policeman going around turning off lights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome many changes in the Bill. The hon. Member for Ceridigion and Pembroke, North 	<i>[Interruption.]</i>—I have Welsh antecedents—brought in the original ten-minute Bill; that was a very sensible Bill. The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed proposed similarly sensible measures, as does the hon. Member for Christchurch. However, none of them has the army of lawyers and the—I am not sure how to describe them—the huge droves of civil servants that the Minister has to help him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had the impression that the number of civil servants is decreasing while the amount of work they are doing has not and that they are working far harder. They deserve a tribute rather than the suggestion that they are sitting around not doing very much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robathan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly pay tribute to the large number of civil servants sitting around doing an immense amount of work. Whether that work is always worthwhile is another matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert B. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reassure my hon. Friend that there certainly are not rafts of lawyers and civil servants. He sought a collective noun to apply to civil servants; I suggest that he considers calling them a quality of civil servants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robathan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That quality of lawyers and civil servants, to use the phrase suggested by my hon. Friend, produces much more detailed legislative proposals and draft legislation than we can achieve in a back room with a couple of secretaries. That is why most of the Government's proposals are sensible and why the Bill is much more refined than the Bill originally produced by the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be noted also that the House has produced some pretty dreadful legislation, even given the qualities of the civil servants involved. However, although many sensible and pragmatic changes are introduced with the aid of Government lawyers' advice, targets are another matter. Blaby district council is my local authority, and it covers about four fifths of the population in my constituency. That authority is very much ahead of the game. It has produced reports similar to those called for by the Bill. It wants the Bill to be implemented with targets, because it fears that other authorities will not fulfil the requirements in the same way if the Bill is left purely permissive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will save money for local authorities, the Government and society in the long term. It will also aid the implementation of many desirable environmental procedures. I urge the Committee to note what the Government have said, including the pragmatic suggestion that the figure be reduced to 25 per cent., but I believe that the targets should be retained in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had great argument about targets and at what level they should be set. The problem with targets is that they set minimum as well as maximum levels. What is appropriate for one authority may not be appropriate for another. That is why I welcome the way in which new clause 3 is framed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill should be about changing public perceptions. It is in the interest of all householders, whether they are landlords or tenants, to embark on energy conservation measures. I should prefer the Government to favour a single energy rating scale, rather than the two scales favoured at present. I should like the public perception to be that, whenever they think about buying a house or about moving into a house as tenants, the first question—not the last question—that must be answered should concern the energy rating of that house. When that is achieved, we shall really be moving into energy conservation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's point can be put even more clearly. People who are worried about the council tax band rating for their house need to realise that their energy rating will make a far greater difference over the period from which they occupy that house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend for that very valid point. When the Select
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0309">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
Committee on the Environment conducted hearings on energy conservation, we went to the Building Research Establishment to inspect one of the experimental houses there. The energy saving targets being sought were at levels of about 60 or 70 per cent.—far higher than the 20 or 30 per cent. being discussed this morning. There is a long way for this country to go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I warmly welcome the Bill. My local authority has written to me in support of it, and I am pleased to wish it every possible success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the enthusiasm of the hon. Member for Nottingham, South that the Bill should be not the end of the road but an important step along the way. The cause of energy conservation should be boosted every time we have a debate like this, because all publicity is good publicity. Energy conservation is one of those happy areas in which environmental and financial interests almost entirely coincide. However, it needs constantly promoting, which is surprising, given that self-interest should drive people to take energy conservation measures. Perhaps it needs promoting at every opportunity because it is not an inherently glamorous subject. However, debate, whether in Committee or in the House, should be helpful and should, I hope, promote the heightened awareness that would lead to the situation that my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury has outlined. He described how home buyers—and therefore home sellers, estate agents and others in related professions—will become more concerned about the energy efficiency of a building. Many hon. Members will have had the experience of completely transforming their energy costs through fairly modest spending on energy-saving measures at home. They will also be aware of the difference in efficiency between the average central heating boiler today and those in the late 1960s, when the central heating boom took off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The value of quantified targets cannot be seriously disputed. The Government signed up to a target for carbon dioxide emissions at Rio in 1992. My hon. Friend the Minister referred on Second Reading to targets that the Government had set for energy savings by Government Departments. He also mentioned that households can cut their energy consumption by as much as 20 per cent. through fairly simple measures. Without specific quantified targets, however, it will be difficult to put pressure on any organisation to make savings, especially in view of the depressing history of some authorities, which have been reluctant to take a positive attitude on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question, then, is whether we should have a specific, quantified target in the Bill. I shall be interested to hear what my hon. Friend the Minister has to say; there is a strong case for including a figure in the Bill. My hon. Friend's new clause asks local authorities to set out measures that are
	<br><blockquote><p>"likely to result in significant improvement in the energy efficiency of residential accommodation".</p></blockquote>
The key word there is "significant". My hon. Friend must, I assume, know what he means by it; perhaps he will tell us whether it means 10 per cent., 20 per cent. or perhaps
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
even 50 per cent. I am sure that he will want to share that with the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has hit the nail right on the head as far as the issue dealt with in the new clause and in the amendments is concerned. On the radio this morning, there was a discussion about the latest opinion poll in Scotland. It was mentioned that the Conservative's rating had gone up form 11 per cent. to 12 per cent. The chairman of the Scottish Conservative party described that as a significant improvement. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that a 1 per cent. increase is not a significant improvement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman wants to distract the Committee. Given the bedrock of support that the Conservatives now enjoy in Scotland, I am extremely optimistic and would be happy to introduce a private Member's Bill that set a quantified target for improving on that increase. I could possibly set a target of at least 100 per cent. Many of my hon. Friends are looking forward to a very early general election and to our representation north of the border being substantially increased, especially because of the extraordinary policies being espoused by the Labour party on the Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my hon. Friend the Minister has a figure to illustrate what he means by the word "significant", I hope that he will explain why he thinks that it should not be included in the Bill. New clause 3, which my hon. Friend will introduce later, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may … give guidance as to what improvements in energy efficiency are to be regarded as significant."</p></blockquote>
If we do not receive a full answer now, we can no doubt probe the point again later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise, of course, that setting a specific target has a number of disadvantages. One is the risk that it might become a minimum. Another more important disadvantage is that it would be unfair to authorities which had already made substantial progress. I sympathise with that argument, but it could be partially alleviated by setting a base date in the past so that past progress could be taken into consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must not be unfair to those authorities that have made good progress, yet many of them are indeed supporters of including a specific target in the Bill. Moreover, including a specific target is not an especially onerous exercise for the authorities since there are no penalties in the Bill for those authorities whose proposals do not reach the target. No retribution will be inflicted on local councils whose proposals are less successful than they or we would wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will show the same flexibility and good sense in responding to the debate on this amendment as he did to the debate on the previous one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the proposals of my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South on the importance of having a past base line. When we set a target for a one third reduction in deaths and serious and slight injuries on the roads, we took an average of the previous three years and used that as a base line. I would, however, counsel against setting too much store on writing targets into the Bill. It is more important to try to build on the significance of having targets at both levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0310">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
A local authority that has already achieved a lot could set a target that was not too great to achieve or could go much further than other authorities that had not yet achieved much. We are beginning to lose the significance of the legislation itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, it is better to be able to adjust targets. They should not be changed too often. When people make mistakes, they should say so. With road casualty reduction we made the mistake of setting the same target for slight injury reduction as we did for deaths and serious injuries reduction. It is the sort of mistake that people make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the outcome of this debate over "significant" or "25 per cent.", I hope that people will recognise that what matters is what is achieved. I am tempted to remember the interchange over Scottish opinion polls. The Labour party seems to have lost three times as much support as the Tories gained, so there was obviously a loss somewhere along the line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for developing his technical argument about whether there should be targets and whether or not they should be backdated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is not only the willingness of the individual local authority, however vigorously they proceed with their energy plans, but the state of their housing stock. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley said, it is easier to deal with new than with old housing stock. Some local authorities—I have already cited Glasgow—have an appalling legacy of old housing stock which would make it difficult for them to meet whatever target we set.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that that is right, but in my constituency, the London borough of Greenwich found that the housing stock that most needed new heating systems, insulation and cladding was that built in the previous 20 years. So we need to be rather careful. Some pre-war housing estates are far more energy-efficient homes, though the method of heating would benefit from upgrading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely what happened in Glasgow. The tenement blocks were built in the 1960s and 1970s.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us return—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of the houses with the lowest energy efficiency may be the ones where the greatest gains can be made by simple basic methods. Tenement blocks in Glasgow, unless horrendously badly built, must be able to achieve a 20 or 30 per cent. reduction in C0	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions. They might still be energy-inefficient after that, but the reduction would have been achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has helped the Committee with that intervention and I acknowledge that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the easiest measures which have the greatest returns should be undertaken first, although that is not the precise issue before the Committee—the issue is whether we use "significant" or "25 per cent." One of the other reasons why I am cautious about joining the 25 of 30 per cent. club is not that I do not want to achieve a saving of 25 or 30 per cent. or more, but because I wonder whether
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
it is appropriate in legislation to have one base line and one proportionate figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On such matters, there is no reason why one view should be any more important than another but I thought that such views should, at least, be stated. I am not convinced that we should lose much by not having a 25 per cent. limit, but I suspect that that is not the general mood of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert B. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, members of the Committee are looking forward to my speech, which is gratifying for any Minister. When we debated energy conservation in October, I said that my response had been more trailed than anything since "The Lion King". That is also true this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The critical debate is, without doubt, how to achieve our objectives. The issue is not just about sending out messages; it is about achieving a long-lasting reduction in the consumption of energy for millions of households. I make no bones about it: I am totally committed to the concept of targets. I manage much of my life by targets and I am sure that other hon. Members do likewise. That is the right way to approach the issue, but it is not quite the same as setting the specific arrangements in stone. I shall go through the arguments in a moment, but I want to make it quiet clear at the beginning that a false dichotomy is being set up, as if me decision were between those who favour targets and those who do not. The decision is about how to achieve aims and how best to motivate local authorities and others in the right direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I rose to oppose clause 2. I shall also speak to new clauses 1 and 4 and to amendment No. 12 in my name and to the amendments to new clause 1 which were tabled by the hon. Member for Christchurch. New clause 1 covers the matters dealt with in clauses 2 and 3 and I shall, in due course, oppose clause 3 as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 1 would recast and modify in certain respects the duty of energy conservation authorities to prepare reports, which is covered by clause 2. The new clause also covers the same ground as clause 3. New clause 4 would provide that an authority may, of its own volition or, if directed by the Secretary of State, modify its initial report or
	<br><blockquote><p>"prepare further reports setting out additional or modified energy conservation measures."</p></blockquote>
In that way, there can be a proper on-going process of updating reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment (a) wants to retain a specific energy-saving target in the Bill. Our discussion has concentrated largely on that. Amendment (b) is designed to require a statement of the priority to be given to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any person or groups of persons in deciding to exercise any powers under this Act, or to make any grant or loan in connection with these measures."</p></blockquote>
New clause 1 goes to the heart of the Bill and it may help if I explain to the Committee how the new clause differs from the existing clauses 2 and 3. Our aim has been to preserve the fundamental concept that a local authority should draw up a report setting out the measures which it considers will result in an improvement in the energy efficiency of residential accommodation in its area. Those reports will have two main purposes. One is to prompt the authority to consider carefully the existing condition of residential accommodation in its area in relation to energy efficiency, to require it to identify
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0311">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
measures it can take to bring about an improvement, and to provide a basis for a programme of action. The other is to enable the Government to have a fuller overview of what measures local authorities have identified as worth while for improving energy efficiency in homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause begins with a reference to the end product of the local authority's duty—the report. It does not refer to assessments or investigations, or to the different approaches an authority may wish to take to housing in its ownership and other stock. That is not to say that there will be no need for assessment or investigation, or that there is any suggestion that an authority should approach its own stock and privately-owned stock in the same way. But these are matters best left to the guidance which a later amendment would allow the Secretary of State to issue, and to the discretion of individual authorities in the light of that guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The energy conservation measures which an authority is to identify in its report are those which it considers to be practicable and cost-efficient. I do not think that any of us would advocate that local authorities should spend time identifying measures which do not meet those two basic tests. The measures identified are also to be considered likely to result in a significant improvement in the energy efficiency of residential accommodation in the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's explanation is helpful, but how should local authorities set their own targets for report making? They do the survey and then have to assess the measures that are cost efficient. That involves a wide spectrum of measures, of which all may be cost efficient. They may choose to take those few measures at the bottom end of the scale that could result in, say, a 10 per cent. saving, or those at the top end that could result in a 30 per cent. saving. Does the Minister consider 5 per cent. or 10 per cent. a significant saving?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come on to the definition of "significant" in a moment. My general response to the hon. Lady is that local authorities, like all of us, should begin with those measures that are cost free, then move on to those that are low cost and then up the scale in descending or ascending order, depending on one's viewpoint, according to the pay-back from the proposal to reduce the consumption of energy. That relates to the question of guidance, which I shall deal with in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word "significant" is important. I understand why the hon. Member for Christchurch and other hon. Members who have spoken are concerned that there is no specific savings target in the new clause to replicate the 30 per cent. figure in clause 2(2)(a). The hon. Lady has suggested in the amendment a lower figure of 25 per cent. in the hope that that might be more acceptable. I assure her and Opposition Members that it is in no sense our wish to encourage or permit authorities to be less than diligent in their identification of sensible energy-saving measures. Our objection is not so much to the particular target chosen—30 per cent., 25 per cent., 20 per cent. or 50 per cent., as has been said—as to the principle that there should be a target in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the theoretical attraction of a numerical target. But I see real practical difficulties, which are
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
shared by local authority associations, with having such a target in the Bill. In their briefing on Second Reading, they said that the associations recognise the importance of defining an energy efficiency target, but that a specific and inflexible target of 30 per cent. would effectively penalise those local authorities that have been proactive in energy efficiency. They also pointed to the difficulty of defining a target—how should it be measured and from what base line, over what period and how often should progress be measured? The associations thought it preferable for there to be a duty to investigate and identify potential for savings and to highlight where the scope was greatest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have considerable sympathy with that view. The argument that authorities are not all starting from the same base is a compelling one. Those which have already been active in energy efficiency and have carried out works to improve the energy efficiency of their own stock may well have more difficulty than those which are less advanced in finding opportunities for a fixed percentage of further savings that are both practicable and cost-effective. If they can do so, so much the better. After all, the authorities that have already shown their commitment to energy efficiency are likely to be the keenest to identify what more can sensibly be done. However, it makes no sense to impose an unnecessary rigidity and cause difficulty for those who are among the best.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is acknowledging the difficulty for the very few and we understand that. Under the Bill, no penalties will be applied to those authorities that fail to reach the 30 per cent. level. Am I right in thinking that, should those authorities produce exemplary reports, as I am sure they will, in which they demonstrate that they had made savings of 10 per cent. in each of the previous two years, so that reaching the 30 per cent. level would be difficult, they would get the Minister's blessing to continue with their more limited programme?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister acknowledge that, by using the word "significant" instead of setting targets, he will encourage some local authorities to choose to go for a very minimal level of achievement because they will pursue his suggestion of doing first the things that cost nothing and then the things that cost very little? I am sure that that is not what the Minister wants to achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it extraordinary that the hon. Lady should suggest that local authorities will not comply with a statutory duty just because there is no penalty. That suggestion ridicules the notion of setting a percentage. The problem with baselines is that although some local authorities in recent years have done much work in measuring the energy efficiency of their homes and the carbon dioxide emissions from them, many authorities even now do not have that information. How can a baseline be backdated when it does not even exist?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard representations from those authorities that have the baseline. They have done the work and have shown what they have achieved. Those authorities could explain to the Minister where there difficulties lie. All hon. Members know that the vast majority of authorities are not in a position to claim that they have made significant strides already, but the vast majority of authorities do not object to a 30 per cent. target.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0312">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I say, the local authority associations provided the briefing. They represent local authorities as a whole. I accept that the authority in Newark and Sherwood, and the other authorities to which the hon. Members for Deptford and for Christchurch may have spoken, have said that they could live with the targets. My own local authority in Dacorum has set itself a target already, for which I am full of praise. However, other authorities, such as Kirklees, take a different view. The local authority associations have identified the problems of the best performing authorities and of the measurement of the target and the baseline.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that many of the authorities that belong to the authorities' associations support a 30 per cent. target? Does not he agree that the main beneficiaries of the lack of targets have been the most intransigent authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that, given the approach towards guidance and housing investment programmes. The hon. Lady has spoken for a number of individual authorities, but I repeat that the local authorities associations speak for local government as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llew Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blaenau Gwent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that a vote for a target of 25 or 30 per cent. is a vote cast in the knowledge of what is being voted for? In contrast, a vote cast for the insertion of the word "significant" would be a vote cast blind. The Minister's explanation has left me none the wiser. Will he elaborate on what he means by "significant"—5, 10, 15 per cent., or what?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been endeavouring to get to that, but I was anxious to allow hon. Members to intervene to clear up some of the misunderstandings. I do not believe that there is as much difference of opinion about ends as some have suggested: the dispute is more about means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the other end of the spectrum, I would not want those authorities where there is still much to be done to be able to take a casual approach, That is why the new clause includes the word "significant". Our normal liaison with authorities, for example through the HIP process, and our scrutiny of the reports, will give us an opportunity for keeping them up to the mark. And the guidance which, if the Committee agrees to a later amendment, the Secretary of State will need to issue will have to be taken into account by authorities, and will be able to address specifically the question of what is "significant". Again, in their briefing, the local authority associations said that they thought that the extent to which local authorities could maximise the use of information they have might usefully be clarified in guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also have much sympathy with the point that there are practical difficulties in deciding how progress against a precise numerical target should be measured. If one is looking for a fixed percentage of savings, one has to determine the starting point or base line, over what period savings are to be made, how they are to be measured and how and when progress is to be monitored. Local authorities are rightly diverse and imposing such a regime on them would be unnecessarily rigid. Their approaches differ. In looking at how local authorities have set and monitored targets for energy efficiency in their non-

housing buildings, we found such a range of targets and monitoring regimes that it was not sensible to set out any centrally laid-down standards, although many authorities had devised their own challenging and well-thought out targets. There is no reason to believe that the position in relation to housing would be any different. Ultimately, it is the commitment and imagination behind the approach that matter, rather than adherence to a single central target in the promotion of greater energy efficiency. I hope that the Bill can further encourage that commitment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has moved on from the point on which I had hoped to intervene. He seemed to be saying that there was such a diversity between local authorities and such unclear base lines from which to start that it would be very difficult to legislate. He also said that that was an argument for not setting a target. How on earth does he propose to give guidance? Does he acknowledge that guidance has no force in law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One possibility is to set a differently based target—for example, that for local authorities' own stock a minimum standard assessment procedure rating should be achieved by a certain date, so that authorities do not worry about the starting point but about where they need to get to. In other words, where one is going would be more critical than where one has started from. My hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury spoke earlier about energy ratings and I see that as one of the most significant developments in recent years. We are already using it for building regulations and new housing association development and I see no reason why it should not be used in regard to the way in which local authorities manage their own stock. The private sector is, of course, a different matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that where one is going is more important than where one has come from, but reductions are also important. A reduction of 30 per cent. is absolutely essential. There is a problem with C0	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions and they must be reduced. I can also see that there may be a problem with the variability between local authorities. Would the Minister accept, however, that the Bill should state the need for a 30 per cent. reduction over the United Kingdom as a whole? We could then consider what variations should occur at a local level. That reduction must be achieved. Would not it be appropriate to include that in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but if one were to consider each and every local authority, in their widely different circumstances, one would fall foul of my test for practicality, cost-effectiveness and so on. As the Bill stands, it is not within the powers of the Secretary of State to be lenient to good authorities if they get into trouble, nor is it within his scope to take a different view on whether the stock in one area happens to be more modern than in another. That is why I am moving towards the case for a much more flexible approach, by which we still try to achieve something overall, but whereby a different approach by different local authorities is allowed. I do not say that that is the be all and end all, but if one applied that approach to the achievement of a minimum target for energy efficiency in local authority stock, for example, those that had the least efficient stock would have furthest to go and those that had the best would have the least. That seems a right and proper approach, both in terms of

	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
the end product of delivering an energy-efficient home to its inhabitant and of setting a starting point for local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may be able to help us on the issue of flexibility. Is it the case that in new clause 2 the Secretary of State can set different timetables—for progress on reports? Is not that in fact the way in which he could exercise his leniency towards those local authorities that already achieve the most and are most willing to cooperate with the Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I come back again to the ways in which we measure energy conservation. A good authority may well be one that has set itself a target, but which does not have the information necessary at the time to quantify it. We come back to the problem—30 per cent. of what? I intended to say at the outset that, while I would manage everything according to targets if I could, we are not dealing with gesture politics here but with real achievements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One has only to consider the debates that took place in the early and mid-1980s about the 30 per cent. club for the reduction of sulphur dioxide emissions to feel a degree of scepticism about setting targets. The hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North follows these matters as closely as I do, and he will know that many countries signed up to the 30 per cent. club on day one, but that many of them did not achieve their targets in the end. They came along and said, "Sorry, we have done our best, but we did not make it." The United Kingdom, however, took a more practical approach and did not sign the 30 per cent. club document, but none the less, achieved more than the 30 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a similar way, I do not want to diminish the achievement that we demand from local authorities, and I certainly subscribe to the principle that there is a 30 per cent. saving out there to be achieved. However, that does not mean that that saving will be equally accessible to every local authority. The pressure we put on some local authorities ought to be greater than on others. That is one reason for approaching targets in a more flexible and less Bill-based way. One of my hon. Friends suggested that we should set targets through a statutory instrument, but the guidance process and the HIP would be much more effective because they would affect the capital allocations to local authorities, and that motivates them. Had we not recently included the energy efficiency section of the HIP guidance, many local authorities would not be taking as much interest in this subject as they are now. As it is, however, most of them fall over themselves to demonstrate to me when I visit them or talk to them about their HIPs that they are doing a lot or have plans to do even more. That is beneficial, and we get the best results where money and guidance meet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's point about the question of 30 per cent. of what is especially pertinent. In his guidance—whether he sets a specific target or keeps the term "significant"—he should set out clear measures, because if different authorities measure on different bases, we shall end up with some odd results. The Government's own 15 per cent. target has proved that, because different Departments have measured it in different ways. Will my hon Friend be clear when he issues his guidance about measuring energy conservation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point that guidance to local authorities should not cover just what is in a report, but also how to arrive at that information and whether that is best done in written form or by encouraging seminars and good practice exchanges of information. I do not know how best to approach those matters now, and I am sure that no hon. Member has thought about them in such detail as yet. However, it is important that we get local authorities to achieve improvements, rather than just pasting up large posters proclaiming what they would like to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not talking just about the environment, important though that is in a local, national and global sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another critical issue is the plight of those people who live in over-cold houses and flats and who, therefore, literally send money up in smoke. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury, I visited the estate in Glasgow. It is horrifying that there can be buildings from which there is a greater loss of heat through the walls than through the windows. My predominant concern was not about global warming—although, with my background, that is obviously a major consideration—but a desperate sympathy for the people who had to live in those flats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must achieve energy conservation, but we will not achieve it by being unduly rigid about what is in the Bill. We must put in place a mechanism that will ensure that the worst local authorities rapidly come up to the standards of the best local authorities. There also needs to be a reasonable approach to the difference between local authorities in their past achievement and in the nature of the stock that they control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simpson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's concern about how we measure particular targets. The recognition that targets are not simply about C0	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions but also about the impact on the lives of people who live in poverty and in accommodation that is massively energy inefficient is an important one. In terms of evaluation, we ought to consider whether the changes that take place have a significant effect in reducing people's energy bills, especially for those on low incomes, and whether the quality of life in such accommodation is significantly improved. There are many ways in which qualitative measures, as well as quantitative measures with regard to household bills, could be incorporated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I still struggle to see how the Bill will work without specific targets. Having a national target would not remove the need for local targets, because within any local authority there is a significant range of energy efficiency in different properties. Targeting the initiatives will be an inevitable part of any locally determined strategy. But I cannot see how an authority can be expected to set a benchmark for itself within the vague context of significant improvement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions must be shorter than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simpson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall conclude with a question. Is it possible for the Government to have their own measuring devices and to judge whether they are meeting commitments which they have entered into internationally under the Rio summit and the climate change convention, if they do not also set targets to be met by local
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0314">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
authorities, which appear to be among the primary delivering mechanisms for engineering that national commitment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but the point that I have been making for some time is that that is the difference between an off-the-peg and a tailor-made approach. I am anxious that the targets are suited to the local authorities concerned and are not laid down as a rigid rule which is blind to circumstance. That is a common-sense approach and I am keen to make sure that we follow it. But we must take into account circumstances that differ from area to area and it might well be appropriate for the distribution of resources to local authorities to reflect those differences. If, hypothetically, a local authority had entirely modern stock with a National Home Energy Rating—I should not use that noun, but I will—of 10, the case for considering that authority in the same way as one such as Glasgow, which has large numbers of very inefficient properties, is weak. They should be encouraged to set different targets, and the guidance should take that into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North referred to other targets. He specifically suggested recycling targets. I have to tell him that the Environment Protection Act 1990—I served on the Committee considering the Bill—did not set out specific targets. The approach was flexible so that we reached a target, but we avoided the rigidity of having it written into the Bill. I hope that Committee members will understand the difference between those two approaches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) of the new clause retains the essence of subsection (3) of existing clause 2. The one substantive change is that the authority will be required to set out its policy for taking into account personal circumstances, rather than merely financial hardship, in exercising its powers. Personal circumstances may, of course, include financial hardship, but we thought it sensible to cast the provision more widely to cover age, health, disability or any other personal circumstances that an authority might consider merit special treatment. That incorporates those who are just above income support levels, for whom the House has demonstrated some concern in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment (b) relates to giving priority to the personal circumstances of any person or groups of persons in deciding to exercise any powers under the Bill or to make any grant or loan in connection with those measures. It was not immediately clear what this amendment sought to add, and I am advised that the drafting is in any case unsatisfactory: the Bill would not, for example, of itself confer any power on authorities to do anything for individuals, so the words 	<br><blockquote><p>"exercise any powers under this Act"</p></blockquote>
in relation to a person or groups of persons makes little sense. The wording in new clause 1 is sufficiently comprehensive to require a statement of the authority's policy towards energy-efficiency measures for those in the categories to which it might wish and be able to give
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
priority in exercising relevant powers. I will, of course, listen carefully and consider what is said today to see if there is any further change that we need to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What we were concerned about in the amendment was to ensure that local authorities' prioritisation did not relate solely to grants and loans. We meant wider prioritisation for people who needed help. That was the purpose of the amendment. We are in agreement in principle, so I hope that we can work out the details later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fortunately, the time is such that I can reflect carefully on the hon. Lady's thoughts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsections (4) and (5) of the new clause preserve the provisions of the existing clause 3, setting out matters which may be covered in reports and giving a declaration that an authority may consult such persons as it considers appropriate in preparing a report. Subsection (6) provides for the publication of the report and its submission to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should perhaps point out that we intend that reports under the Bill should be available to the public. Reports will be covered by the Environmental Information Regulations 1992, thus ensuring public access to relevant information held both from local authorities and from the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State can, of course, be held to account in Parliament for the exercise of his duties under the Bill, and indeed I venture to suggest as a former Chairman, of the Select Committee on the Environment that it might wish to look at how the provisions are working having been in operation for some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 12 is a consequential amendment to the long title. It would bring the terminology that would be used in the Bill if the new clause were agreed into the long title. "Reports", rather than "plans", is the language used in both the Bill as given a Second Reading and in amendments. "Residential accommodation" rather than "residential properties" is similarly used in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 4 makes provision for the updating of reports from time to time, at the instigation either of the energy conservation authority or of the Secretary of State. An authority will be able to choose, or the Secretary of State will be able to direct it, to modify an initial report or to prepare a further report setting out additional or modified energy conservation measures. The same provisions, including those relating to updating, will apply to subsequent reports as apply to initial reports. The process can thus be an ongoing one, and the initial report will not be the end of the story. If an authority wishes to change—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
