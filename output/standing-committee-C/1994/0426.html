	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That during proceedings on the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill the Committee do meet tomorrow at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
It is a pleasure to move the sittings motion with you, Mr. Hogg, in the Chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have moved the motion because the Bill has been pushed into a corner. Outside of a procedural coup, Friday is the last practical day for Report stage and Third Reading of the Bill. The Bill must be out of Committee by close of business on Thursday, but the Minister has tabled 111 unstarred amendments and two starred amendments. The only chance of the Bill being discussed on Friday is if the sittings motion is accepted so that we can deal with the amendments by the close of business on Thursday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why are we in this predicament? Changes in the business of the House mean that only five days are left for the Report stage of private Members' Bills. That produces problems, as we know from experience with the Bill before us, which must be reported back to the House. The Government have decided that only Standing Committee C is available for private Members' Bills. This is the fifth private Member's Bill this session. The four earlier Bills have made slow progress, yet all those Bills were either Government Bills or were supported by the Government and the Opposition. We expected to reach the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill before now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of the previous Bills had extra sittings. A sittings motion was passed on the Home Energy Conservation Bill, but that proved to be unnecessary because that Bill was dealt with in two sittings. The Activity Centre (Young Persons Safety) Bill had three sittings and the Proceeds of Crime Bill had three sittings, which was surprising because it was promoted by the hon. Member for Exeter (Sir J. Hannam), who is joint chairman of the all-party disablement group and was aware of our need to move forward. The third sitting of that Bill in Committee lasted a mere 18 minutes, which was a serious waste of opportunity for which we would have been very grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Road Traffic (New Drivers) Bill, which was promoted by the hon. Member for Rochford (Dr. Clark), was in Committee for two weeks. Although it is a private Member's Bill, it should be considered to be a Government Bill. When I was lucky in the draw for private Members' Bills, I received a letter from the Minister for Transport in
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
London asking whether I would take on that Bill. It stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The attached papers describe a Bill designed to improve the safety of new drivers by requiring those who offend to re-take their test."</p></blockquote>
An extra problem has arisen from the Road Traffic (New Drivers) Bill because the promoter of the Bill chose to take the Report stage this Friday instead of last Friday, as would have been his right, had he so wished. That has seriously annoyed organisations for the disabled, which have realised that, even if we manage to reach Report stage by Friday, being number two on the list will make it more difficult for us to make progress if there is a great deal of talking on the Road Traffic (New Drivers) Bill. That is why 15 disabled people—reflecting the 15 attempts to put this legislation on the statute books—have set off on a march from Rochford to London. They are due to arrive here on Friday, when we hope that the Bill will be dealt with in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remaining impediments to progress are the amendments in the name of the Minister, 22 of which relate to the word "qualified", which reduces the number that we have to deal with separately. Others are technical, covering various slips in the drafting of the Bill. For example, there are two amendments which would change the words "Great Britain" to "United Kingdom", which would be a correct technical adjustment because the Bill applies to the whole of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bulk of amendments represent an attempt to turn my Bill into the Government's Disability Discrimination Bill, which has already been through the House. Why has that been done? The Government have their own Bill, so there is no need to turn this one into something that looks like it. A second Bill that is a carbon copy of the Government's could not proceed on the Floor of the House for procedural reasons. "Erskine May" is quite clear that there cannot be two such similar Bills before the House, although there was a ruling ahead of the Second Reading of the Disability Discrimination Bill that permitted this Bill to go forward, even though the Government's Bill had already done so, because of specific differences between them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that can be said in favour of the bulk of the amendments in the Minister's name is that they are in his name.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Andrew Bowden 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brighton, Kemptown)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that accepting the amendments table by my hon. Friend the Minister would invalidate the Bill on the Floor of the House? Perhaps we could have guidance from the Chairman on the matter as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has always been a procedural problem if there are two similar Bills going through the House. I consulted "Erskine May" and discussed the matter with the Clerks in the Public Bill Office. They eventually made it clear that there was no problem with going ahead with a Second Reading, but that did not mean that there would not be problems on Report, depending on the progress made on the Government's Bill and how the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0094">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
two rubbed up against each other. The more similar this Bill becomes to the Government's Bill, the greater the problems will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is mainly a matter of judgment. You, Mr. Hogg, have been asked to respond to the question, but I doubt whether you are in a position to do so. You are in control of proceedings in Committee and it is perfectly in order for the Committee to do as it wishes, within its rules, even if the Minister is successful in changing the Bill out of all recognition to become like the Government's Bill. The problem would arise when it returned to the Floor of the House—on Friday, I hope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to ensure that we make progress in Committee, but we must also be careful not to leave ourselves in a procedurally difficult position on Friday, as the authorities in the House would presumably rule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree the only possible approach for the Committee is to consider the Bill on its merits, even for those of us who think that it will place too great a burden on industry and commerce?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the consequence of that is to make it more like the Government's Bill, that must be so. The only sensible and possible approach for the Committee is to consider each clause and its effects and consequences on their merits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I grant that we are here to consider matters on their merits but considering matters on their merits is not separate from procedural considerations. In debating the sittings motion, we are able to state the difficulties. The main difficulty is the opportunity of the House to decide now between two Bills—my Bill was given its Second Reading by 175 votes to nil, with cross-party support, whereas the Government only squeezed through their measure by using the Whips. They were only supported by Conservative Members and never received any wider support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Berry 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingswood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Government's attitude to the Bill was to debate it clause by clause on its merits, and to table appropriate amendments, will my hon. Friend speculate why, at this time last year, the Government tabled not a single amendment in Committee? Could it be that last year the Government decided to wreck the Bill on the Floor of the House, and that this year they have decided to wreck the Bill in Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was a great deal of blood on the Floor of the House last year because of the procedures used by the Government. They have learnt from that experience and are trying to smother the Bill in silence within the Committee Corridor. However, we still have the opportunity to make progress on the basis of the feeling that is strong not only in the country and among disablement organisations, but in the House. In deciding the merits of the Bill, we should also be aware of those considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to the Minister to withdraw those amendments
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
that are dedicated to changing this Bill into his Bill. He is, of course, in order to oppose what is being done, and to vote against various provisions as they arise. By doing that, he would enable us to make progress, and he would be able to retain his nice guy image. Otherwise, because the amendments have not been farmed out to Conservative Members, they will fall on his shoulders and it will be clear that he bears the procedural responsibility for damaging the Bill. A great weight could be taken off his shoulders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for High Peak (Mr. Hendry), who was the Minister's parliamentary private secretary, will stick to the traditions of the normal operation of a PPS. When I recommended to the Committee of Selection who should be members of this Committee, I had an agreement with the Minister's office that that is what would happen. A great deal of weight will be on the Minister, who has tabled a massive amount of amendments, and those who might also wish to speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Hendry 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(High Peak)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that he has reached an agreement that I should not speak? As he is aware, my background is as a special adviser at the Department of Social Security, working both with my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House, then Secretary of State for Social Security, and my right hon. Friend the Member for Chelsea (Sir N. Scott), with whom I have been closely involved in preparing the Goverment's Bill. I want to be on this Committee because I want to be able to explain why the Government's Bill is better. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that he has reached an agreement, without my knowledge, and that I cannot speak in the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The recommendation that I made to the Committee of Selection was based on the understanding that the hon. Gentleman would be acting as PPS to the Minister, as he was at that time, and would be assisting him in that way. I believe that his position as PPS has since changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have allowed the hon. Member for High Peak to make his point, and the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes) to respond. I do not want the point to be laboured. The motion before the Committee is about the time of our sittings rather than the conduct of hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. Is not it open to any member of the Committee to speak at any time on any matter that is before the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have a hard job trying to stop any member of the Committee from speaking. Hon. Members who have been appointed by the Committee of Selection to the Committee are free to conduct themselves within the Standing Orders that govern our procedures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The sittings motion is affected by the intentions of members of the Committee. If the hon. Member of High Peak intends to make lengthy contributions, in an attempt to back up the Minister, that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0095">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
would affect the time available to us, and therefore the sittings motion. It might, however, cause some problems. I must appeal to the Minister to respond in a way that would allow us to facilitate our business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Andrew Bowden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I must put on record the fact that I am a member of the Committee of Selection. When the Committee of Selection decided on the appointment of hon. Members, I do not recall any arrangement being made to the effect that conditions would be imposed on hon. Members if they were selected for this Committee. I believe that I am right in saying that it would be quite improper if such conditions were imposed. I do not want to be obstructive to the promoter of the Bill—he knows that I supported his Bill on Second Reading—but it is important to put the record straight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made the point that I do not want any discussion about the Committee of Selection, not least because I have no authority with respect to its deliberations. However, the hon. Member for Brighton, Kemptown made his point, the matter should be left as it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to propose a manuscript amendment to the sittings motion, in line 2, to leave out from "meet" to the end, and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock".</p></blockquote>
I welcome you, Mr. Hogg, as Chairman of the Committee. In this Parliament I have already had the good fortune of serving on a Standing Committee on which you served as a distinguished Chairman. We can count on your most helpful advice as we proceed in our discussion of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the third Standing Committee on which I have served in this Parliament. I am very concerned about the way that the House legislates. I believe that the House produces far too much legislation, and that a lot of it is ill-conceived and poorly thought out. There are various reasons for that, one of which is the fact that too little time is given in Standing Committee to the consideration of the practical consequences and detailed implications of legislation. There are several examples of that, but I shall not go into them now, because they are not relevant to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said on Second Reading, if the Bill were enacted, it would have a massive impact on industry and commerce through the imposition of costs. I entirely understand the comments of the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-West about the need for the Bill to reach the Floor of the House by Friday. However, frankly, I do not think that that is a sensible way to proceed if we want legislation that is of good quality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Liz Lynne 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rochdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman appreciate that the Bill has been debated, more or less in its present form, time and again? We have had ample time to
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
consider the Bill's provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be true of the hon. Lady, but it is certainly not true of myself and, I suspect, many other hon. Members. As we have heard from the hon. Member for Kingswood (Mr. Berry), the matter was not discussed properly in Committee last year. We should have a proper discussion of the Bill's provisions line by line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the hon. Gentleman is referring to my previous comments. I should like to make it clear that I did not say that the Bill had not been discussed extensively in Committee last year. It was. I merely said that, on that occasion, the Government chose not to table a single amendment or, indeed, to vote against a single clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Gentleman for misunderstanding him. However, in my judgment, that does not remove the need for the House in this Session to give proper consideration to this Bill. I do not believe that that can sensibly be achieved between Wednesday at 10.50 am and Friday morning. That is not a sensible proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That being so, does not the hon. Gentleman accept that it is disgraceful that the Government—not my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East—have put the Committee in that position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no knowledge of that. I was appointed to serve as a member of the Committee at the invitation of the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East, the promoter of the Bill. That proposal was made to and agreed to by the Committee of Selection. Until I received notice that the Committee would meet this morning, I did not know what was happening to the Bill. I was appointed to the Committee a while ago. I believe that we have reached the point where we can consider the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand entirely why the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East wants the Bill to be discussed on the Floor of the House on Friday morning. However, the fact that we are only meeting on Wednesday morning may have something to do with someone else but it has nothing to do with me. It may seem that I am adopting a rather selfish approach, but on Second Reading, I explained my major concerns about the cost of implementing the Bill's provisions. Everyone understands the benefits that would accrue from it, but it is important properly to weigh up the costs and benefits of legislation. The Bill's provisions would impose substantial costs on employers and on industry and commerce. We need to consider that aspect in detail. It certainly was not possible to consider every provision in detail on Second Reading. I also believe that we need to consider the Bill in less of a frantic rush than the sittings motion proposes. That is why I propose instead that we should meet on Wednesday mornings—I understand that that is the normal arrangement for Committees dealing with private Members' Bills—to consider the important details of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
amendment moved by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) and, therefore, I will ask him to move it formally at the end of the debate to facilitate a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester, Wythenshawe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East, I warmly welcome you, Mr. Hogg, to the Chair of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield talked of considering Bills on their merits. I first presented this Bill to the House in 1991, since when it has been approved three times by the other place. Here it has been obstructed again and again and again by a minority of Members of Parliament. I say that because it has been demonstrated in Session after Session since 1991 that there was in the previous Parliament, as there has been since, a clear and undeniable majority in favour of the Bill. Is that considering the Bill on its merits?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the first time that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield has been in a Committee on the Bill; and I have intervened to say why I think that the motion should be and must be approved if the reputation of this House is not to be further damaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an historic occasion for two reasons—first, because after 31 years in the House of Commons I cannot think of any other Bill that has been so comprehensively debated as this one. And secondly, because my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East had fourth place in the list of balloted Bills and I cannot think of any previous Session in which the Bill of an hon. Member with so high a place in the list did not reach Committee until it was too late for it to stand any chance of reaching Report stage. I shall be grateful if the hon. Member for Beaconsfield can enlighten me as to any other occasion when a Bill with majority support won such a high place in the ballot and did not reach Committee before this time in the parliamentary Session.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, we should make progress—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman asked for examples.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very well then—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman asked for examples of Bills in the same position. I recall that in 1984–85, the same thing happened with the Powell Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he looks again, the hon. Gentleman will not find an exact precedent for what has happened in the case of this Bill. It cannot be denied that no other Bill that has been debated at such length to Report Stage and which has attracted a clear parliamentary majority has failed to make progress. The hon. Member talked about "a sensible way to proceed". Is it a sensible way to proceed when
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
right hon. and hon. Members have to make personal statements of apology on the Floor of the House of Commons for misleading the Speaker and their parliamentary colleagues in debates on a Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During my time in the House of Commons, I have witnessed four personal statements of apology for misleading the House. The first was over the Poulson affair when, I think it was in 1975, an hon. Member apologised for misleading the House of Commons about his role in that affair and made a personal statement of unreserved apology. Of the other three apologies that I have witnessed, the first was the apology made by the former hon. Member for Bristol, Kingswood, Robert Hayward, who said that he would not talk the Bill out on a Friday afternoon and then did so. He made a statement of apology to the Speaker and to the House. The second occasion was when the right hon. Member for Chelsea, as a Minister, made a personal statement of apology for misleading the House. The third occasion was when the hon. Lady the Member for—[Hon. Members: "Sutton and Cheam"]. It is unforgivable of me to forget the name of her constituency (Lady Olga Maitland). She also made a personal statement of apology for misleading the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus three out of the four personal statements of apology for misleading the House of Commons I have witnessed were in debates on this Bill. That is not a sensible way to proceed. The Bill has been treated disgracefully. I have to say finally in presenting my arguments for the motion that any stranger looking at the Committee today would see the whole truth about the Bill at a glance. If he or she considered the party affiliation on the Benches occupied by those in favour of the Bill, they would see that we comprehensively represent all parts of the House of Commons, whereas on the other side there are only Conservative MPs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that today we can redeem the reputation of the House by agreeing that the Bill must be given a fair chance. I can assure disabled people that we shall carry on until the full aims of the Bill are enacted, however long that takes. Our determined resolve is to ensure that disabled people have full citizenship and equal rights. That is what the Bill is all about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Lynne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Hogg.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About 10 months ago, the Government acted disgracefully on the other Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill, and they seem to be acting similarly today. They are using different tactics—not on the Floor of the House, but this time in Committee—and attempting to kill off the Bill by having the Minister table all the amendments himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the sittings motion, as we need to have time to debate the Bill this afternoon. We need to get through it as quickly as possible, because the Government have not given us enough time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last time, the Government said that they were against the principle of the Bill, they were then forced to introduce
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0097">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
their own Bill, admitting that education and persuasion—which they had been claiming for a long time were the only things—had not worked. They admitted that they were wrong about that and about many other things. Let us hope that they realise that legislation on civil rights for disabled persons should have been introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sad, because I believe that the Government will get their way and manage to scupper the Bill, just as they, disgracefully, managed to get rid of last year's Bill. Let us be clear that, although the Government Bill will be enacted, disabled people's organisations still want civil rights for disabled people. They will carry on fighting for that and making sure that the Government hear their voices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government Bill is littered with exemption clauses, qualifications and everything possible for a get-out on disability. I am grateful for many of that Bill's provisions, but it does not give civil rights to disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A wide range of organisations support this Bill, including the Rights Now consortium, which has done much work to lobby the Government and to give briefings to hon. Members from all parties. I should also mention the Royal National Institute for the Blind, the Royal National Institute for Deaf People, Sense, the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation, MIND and Scope. The list of organisations that support the Bill is endless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation, which the Bill is. We should support the sittings motion. We need to get the definition right—it is not right in the Government's Bill. We need a commission with teeth and not a disability council. We need to include, not exclude, disabled people. The Bill affords protection to the discriminated, not justification to the discriminating. I support the motion, as I hope, will the whole Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also support the sittings motion moved by the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East. I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his determination that the Bill be brought before the House again. I am extremely anxious that the Bill should make progress, return to the Floor of the House, receive proper scrutiny and be enacted. The Bill represents the comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation that should apply to disability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that we should sit this afternoon and that we should sit again on Thursday—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I shall clarify the matter. The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Rochdale (Ms Lynne) both referred to this afternoon. I thought that it was a slip of the tongue, for neither the motion nor the amendment refers to Wednesday afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Hogg.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be entirely right that we sit on Thursday, so that
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
we can make good progress in the scrutiny of the Bill. As the right hon. Member for Manchester, Wythenshawe (Mr. Morris) said, the Bill has been considered deeply. It is based on an established model of legislation that already operates in the Unite states of America. It has received much scrutiny here, not least from the Standing Committee which considered the Bill tabled last year by the hon. Member for Kingswood. There is no reason why we should not rapidly deal with the Bill promoted by the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, I welcome, in principle, that my hon. Friend the Minister should begin to take a more active interest in the details of the Bill. As we have not yet had an opportunity to examine in detail the purport of the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend, I trust that he intends to reveal, in a spirit of serious constructiveness, the Government's opinion of the Bill and what he considers to be its merits and defects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we could proceed rapidly, there would be plenty of opportunity for my hon. Friend the Minister to put forward the essence of his case. If we have an opportunity to debate the Bill this morning and again tomorrow, my hon. Friend could say everything that is important for him to say. If we were regrettably unable to scrutinise all the amendments that my hon. Friend has tabled by Thursday night, no doubt he and his officials would be happy to join us here again, Wednesday after Wednesday, until the crack of doom or the general election—two very different events.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This debate is set in the context of the deeply unsatisfactory systems and procedures established by the House for the consideration of private Members' legislation. This private Member's Bill is important; it is properly and passionately the concern of millions of people in this country. The bill's passage and serious scrutiny are threatened by the self-imposed procedural deficiencies of the House. As a matter of urgency, we should reform the procedures for the consideration of private Members' legislation, which bring the House of Commons and the Government into disrepute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that the Jopling Committee's recommendations did not go further on the use of parliamentary time on Wednesday mornings. I am glad that Wednesday mornings are now used to consider Back Benchers' motions in the Chamber, but I regret that the Committee and the House did not take the reform a stage further by deciding that Wednesday mornings should be available for the scrutiny of private Members' Bills. Parliament could then deal with such responsibilities far more effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have a legitimate interest in private Members' Bills and have their own opinion of such legislation's merits. They are quite properly concerned about the public expenditure implications of private Members' Bills. We cannot object to the principle that the Government table amendments to or, from time to time, oppose such Bills or elements within them, but, importantly, those Government amendments should be serious and not simply designed to wreck such Bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty is that any significant number of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0098">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Government amendments to the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill, notwithstanding that they might deal with matters that are valid for debate and decision by the House, will effectively wreck it because of the lack of parliamentary time. It might have been preferable, therefore, if we had set aside Wednesday mornings for consideration of private Members' legislations and Friday mornings for consideration of private Members' motions. The most important point is that we should have sufficient time—the best time that we can make available—for parliamentary scrutiny of the important measures proposed by Back-Bench Members of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have no objection to the Government issuing a Whip to their supporters on private Members' legislation. That is not realistic for Fridays, for practical reasons that we all understand, but I see no difficulty about that occurring on a Wednesday. The advantage would be that the Government's opposition to a private Member's Bill would be overt and candidly expressed, and they would not be left to find ways to frustrate private Members' Bills by subterfuge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the unhappy history of parliamentary consideration of the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill will precipitate further consideration of the need to reform our procedures for dealing with private Members' legislation. I wrote last year to the right hon. Member for Honiton (Sir P. Emery), who is Chairman of the Select Committee on Procedure, in the wake of the debacle over the same Bill presented by the hon. Member for Kingswood. The remedy for those problems lies with us in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know, Mr. Hogg, whether the Chairmen's Panel meets from time to time to consider the ways in which we scrutinise legislation. I wonder whether you think that this is a subject that members of the Chairman's Panel could validly consider. They may have thoughts to put forward to the Select Committee on Procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought I heard a sigh. Having been invited to sit on the Committee, I think it is in order for me to have a view on the sittings motion. I came with general good will towards the Bill, although not necessarily towards the detail of it. Having heard what has been said, however, I intend to vote against the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not know that such a sittings motion had been tabled, until I arrived and saw it on the Order Paper. No doubt it had been on the Order Paper previously and I should have done my homework, but I did not see it there before. I have a surgery tomorrow morning. Afterwards, I am going to the black carers' conference and speaking to Politics for Scientists in the afternoon, so I would not be able to be present. In a way, I am making my apologies for not being present tomorrow by voting against the sittings motion which, I think, is almost unprecedented, although I suspect that nothing in the House is entirely unprecedented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already served on two private Members' Bills this
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Session. I was asked by the promoter of a third private Member's Bill to sit on the Committee, but in the event I was not needed. To have served three times on Bills in this Session does not give me a better right than any other Member to hold views or to express them, but it shows that I take a serious interest in the passage of private Members' legislation, as I do in the passage of Government legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Frankly, I am getting fed up with the people who go trampling over the reputation of my right hon. Member for Chelsea. If those who have been in Government have forgotten what it is like, and those who have not been in the Government cannot ask those who have, the right hon. Member for Wythenshawe could correct anyone who thought that the Minister for Disabled People could set Government policy as he wished. After the events of the previous Session and the present Session, several hon. Members should look in the mirror and say sorry to themselves, if not to my right hon. Friend the Member for Chelsea, who I think is one of the best Members of Parliament and one of the best Ministers for Disabled People that we have had since the right hon. Member for Wythenshawe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that this is an unprecedented motion. It is a response to an unprecedented situation. I spoke earlier of my experiences as a Member of Parliament. I was simply talking in factual terms about the disgraceful way in which the Bill has been treated. I suspect, as I have made clear before on the floor of the House of Commons, that the right hon. Member for Chelsea was not always in favour of what he had to say as Minister. I understand that very well. What I am trying to make clear today is that not one but several Members have been involved in what I think—and what the hon. Gentleman must also think—was a disgraceful episode that was demeaning to the House of Commons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The official record of the Committee's proceedings will show that I did not say that what has happened is unprecedented. I remember saying that I suspect that very little is unprecedented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the hon. Gentleman said that it was an unprecedented motion. I am saying that it is a response to an unprecedented situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I say for the third time that I do not believe that it is unprecedented. I think that it is highly unusual. Again, I believe that the record will show that I have said that twice before. I say it now for the third time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall digress briefly. If a Bill is introduced several times over several years and is not passed, there are probably serious reasons for such treatment by the House of Commons—as we know, that usually means by the Government. I have not seen a full and agreed costing of the Bill's impact. That may be a matter for Third Reading and it should not delay the Committee now—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] If it is agreed with the Government, that is fine. I did not realise that. I have not done as much
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0099">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
homework on this Bill as I usually do—unlike many others, including the hon. Member for Kingswood, who has been at it for years. If the Promoter of the Bill, the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East, wants the serious all-round support of the Committee for sitting at unusual hours—I am sure that the hon. Gentleman and I can agree that that is what the sittings motion will lead to—it would have been advisable to ensure that all hon. Members knew in advance what was intended. That is not made as a personal criticism, but I try to run my diary flexibly a week ahead in order to try to allow for various other commitments that may arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My difficulty was that the Road Traffic (New Drivers) Bill completed its Committee stage only last Wednesday. I tried to discover whether the Committee on my Bill could sit on Tuesday, but it was not procedurally possible. I then thought that we might sit on Wednesday afternoon. I raised that possibility at business questions, but it required a resolution to be tabled on the Floor of the House by the Leader of the House. It was not until 9 pm two days ago that I received a reply from the Leader of the House. I was hemmed in, but the Bill was at least on the Order Paper so that hon. Members could see.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. I suspect that it would have been quite easy for those who wanted to block the Committee stage of the Bill to ensure, one way or another, that the committee on the Road Traffic (New Drivers) Bill failed to conclude its proceedings last week so that our proceedings today and, potentially, tomorrow could not take place. That is, however, in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from what the promoter of the Bill has said that we cannot sit this afternoon. I would have been ambivalent about the prospect as I have to attend the Select Committee on Transport this afternoon to discuss bus deregulation, but I would at least have been in the House. We are faced with the question of whether or not to sit tomorrow. To avoid delay, I have not raised a point of order to ask what would happen if the sittings motion were neither amended or carried. I wonder whether the Committee would automatically meet the following Wednesday or whether our proceedings could not continue. Perhaps you, Mr. Hogg, will be able to advise the Committee on the procedural consequences of the various options.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I can clarify that by saying that I would appoint a day for further consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to encourage or tolerate unnecessary party political partisanship. It is unnecessary. Most progress comes not from people pushing further than the Government or society want to go, but from trying to achieve as much consensus as possible. We have seen that clearly with the Government's Bill, which has already been referred to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However much progress we manage to make today or tomorrow with this Bill—or with the Government's Bill or future legislation—it is its implementation that matters
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
most. I would like to share two experiences with the Committee: one from yesterday and the other from eight years ago when I was a junior Minister at the Department of Transport, with responsibility for mobility. Yesterday, I went for a walk past Waterloo. Down the bull ring there is a guide to the disabled route but the disabled lift has had an out-of-service sign on it for some time. However much we introduce preparatory or statutory requirements, it is things on the ground that matter most. On the same visit I noticed that anyone in a wheelchair leaving Waterloo Eurostar's continental service would find that the barriers to prevent trolleys from being taken away would also block the wheelchair. I saw a German, escorting someone in a wheelchair who got blocked and had to go into the road instead of staying on the pavement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other example aims to illustrate why I believe that detail is important and why I support what has already been said. It relates to my time at the Department of Transport. We set up the first bus service to make accessible trains to planes at Heathrow. There was no major problem at Gatwick because the train service went directly to that airport and lifts could be taken up into the terminals. Heathrow is not the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. Is this strictly relevant to the sittings motion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I should rule on that first point of order before the hon. Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomly) makes an observation about it. I have interrupted once or twice already this morning to try to keep the proceedings in order. What the hon. Member for Eltham is saying is not strictly in order, but I shall allow him to finish his point as he has said that he will make it briefly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The anecdote will only last 45 seconds more but it concerns a serious point and explains why I should prefer to take part in the Committee's proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That bus service could transport people in wheelchairs to and from Heathrow from London railway stations. I tried to use it when I was asked to provide a subsidy of £300,000 a year to keep it going. I could not find the bus stop. When I did so and the bus came, the driver said, "You're the first passenger I've picked up from Victoria in three months." It turned out that a one-off capital payment of £150,000 was needed to provide integrated transport through the buses that left every 15 minutes from regular bus stops. That is an example of how statutory legislation, such as that which the Bill would provide, might have stopped us from getting a better service. That is why I think that much of the detail behind the Bill is enormously important. I do not want to get involved in discussing the costs but the details of the requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, as several Labour Members have said, it seems unrealistic that the Bill will be enacted in the time allowed, the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East should press
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0100">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
the Government to accept the provisions of clause 20. That would give disabled people access to polling stations. The clause has no amendments and deals with a matter on which there might be agreement. We could sort out the details on the Floor of the House on Friday. Progress could be made from that initiative and such action could provide a stepping stone for those wanting to go further and faster. The normal procedure for contentious private Members' Bills—this has certainly occurred on an earlier such Bill this Session—is for the promoter and the Minister to get together quietly to see what progress can be made, not necessarily through total agreement but by mutual understanding. It would be a pity if that specific clause, which could, I think be introduced quickly, were lost before the next general election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Social Security and Disabled People (Mr. William Hague)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I join others in welcoming you, Mr. Hogg, to the Chair. I welcome many familiar faces from at least one other Committee, which has already sat this Session on the Disability Discrimination Bill. Many of us are becoming familiar with each other's views. We are in an unusual situation this Session because two Bills are concerned with the same subject—the Government's Disability Discrimination Bill and the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill. The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East has responded to that with today's sittings motion which, as some of my hon. Friends have pointed out, is an unusual and a sudden development. Although there are reasons for it, which do not necessarily invalidate his action, I do not agree with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman did not mean to put it that way, but, to many of us, describing discussions on clauses and amendments to a Bill as a charade goes wide of the mark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest respect, I do not think that that is a point or order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that my language was extremely modest in the circumstances. I have a fundamental point to put to the Minister, relating to the motion. On Second Reading he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Government intend to ensure that our Bill to end discrimination becomes law and that this Bill does not."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 10 February 1995; Vol. 254, c. 629.]</p></blockquote>
Is that still the Government's position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, of course it is. I shall deal with that point later. I am not sure what the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) meant by a charade. He may have been referring to this debate on the sittings motion, in which case I hope that he recalls the debate on
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
the sittings motion in the Committee which considered the Disability Discrimination Bill, which took the whole of the first sitting and during which the hon. Gentleman spoke for a good deal longer than half an hour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should not pretend to be more naive than he really is. It would be extremely discourteous of him not to admit that the usual channels agreed on how much time would be allocated to each aspect of the Government's Bill and Labour Members stuck rigidly to that agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is partly correct. The usual channels made an agreement on the progress of the Bill, which was stuck to. The hon. Gentleman was as good as his word in sticking to the timetable, for which I give him due credit. No such agreement had been made, however, at the time of the debate on the sittings motion and what the hon. Gentleman has said does not invalidate my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to respond to some of the points made by other hon. Members. The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East made an interesting argument about the amendments that I have tabled, saying that if they were carried, it might no longer be possible for the Bill to be proceeded with because of the conventions of the House. That is an interesting and innovative argument, but I am sure that it is wrong in this case because there are two key areas of difference between the Disability Discrimination Bill and the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill on which I have not tabled any amendments: the establishment of a commission and the exemption of small employers from the employment provisions. Even if all my amendments were carried, the Bill would still not be turned into the Government's Bill. A decision was reached on the Floor of the House on Report of the Government's Bill on those other matters and I have no doubt that the House would wish to revisit them when this Bill reaches Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those final few words answered my question. Does the fact that he has not tabled amendments on those issues in Committee mean that he will not table such amendments on Report on Friday?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. It means that the Report stage is the logical time for such amendments to be tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman may have missed the point I was making. I was answering the argument of the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East that, if all the Government's amendments were carried, the Bill may not be able to proceed any further because it would become so similar to the Disability Discrimination Bill. That cannot be right. If the Bill went on to Report, even with all my amendments there would still be two fundamental differences between the Bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East referred to the support that his Bill received on Second Reading—175 votes. He said rather cheekily that the Government's Bill squeezed through with a majority of 27, but it was passed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0101">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
with a total vote of 307. That is many more than 175 and it clearly represents the majority view of the House. The hon. Gentleman also suggested that the Government are trying to smother the Bill with amendments. It would be extraordinary if I, as the Minister, having taken through the House in the past few months a Bill on the same subject, which shares the same objectives as the hon. Gentleman's Bill, but accomplishes them by different means, did not set out to debate a rival Bill and to raise some of the points that had arisen on the Government Bill. I may be a nice guy, but I would have to be an incredibly nice guy not to move any amendments or raise any points about a Bill that is in direct competition with one that I had promoted and which has passed through the House to another place. I am not that incredibly nice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak who was my PPS and who did such sterling work that he has been promoted to be PPS to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education. When the Committee of Selection met, however, he was still my PPS. I suppose that hon. Members could have made representations to the Committee of Selection on changing the membership of the Committee in the light of my hon. Friend's role, but that did not happen. As my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Kempton (Sir A. Bowden) reminded us, no deal was done with the Committee of Selection and it is a little unfair to deny my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak the right to speak in the Committee. In fact, he has spoken already. The right hon. Member for Wythenshawe referred to previous incidents in which he said the House had been misled and apologies had been made. He was extremely unfair to my Right hon. Friend the Member for Chelsea. It was unnecessary for him to go over the past because there are no longer such disputes about misleading the House. I have never misled the House on the Government's approach to the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill—we share its objectives but we disagree with it. That has been my consistent approach and will be throughout the Bill's proceedings. I have never made a secret of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is one thing to disagree with the Bill and to use the various avenues of the House to oppose it, but quite another to engage in procedural games to prevent its consideration by the House. It would have been statesmanlike if the Minister had facilitated decisions being made between the two Bills. He referred to the voting figures. The 175 hon. Members who supported my Bill on Second Reading, the number of sponsors it has and number of hon. Members who supported the early-day motion show the massive support for my Bill from all parties in the House. That majority of 175 was secured on a Friday, not on a three-line-Whip day, so it demonstrated impressive support and represented differing opinion in the House. The Minister must argue his corner, but should he be involved in every possible action to squash the possibility of making a choice between the two Bills?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand how desirable it might be to make a direct choice between the two Bills. There is no provision in the procedures of the House, however, to do that, although there is ample provision to debate matters
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
that appear in both Bills. In the course of our debate on the Disability Discrimination Bill, we have already debated many subjects that we shall turn to in the course of our debate on this Bill. We have already debated whether there should be a commission or an exemption for small employers, and the appropriate definition of "disablity". The House has made decisions. No member of the Committee should say that I have been unwilling to debate those matters or that I am unwilling to debate the Bill. I am extremely willing to do so. I have not attempted to stop the Bill from being debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) made an interesting point—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has offered a defence to non-existing allegations. I made no allegation that he has either misled the House or ever attempted to mislead it. His position, as my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East noticed, has been pikestaff plain from the outset. I was making no particular attack on the right hon. Member for Chelsea. If the Minister reads the debates on this Bill—in Committee and on the Floor of the House—he will see that I paid many tributes to the right hon. Member. In one such tribute I made clear my recognition that Government's are not seamless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The right hon. Member seems to be forgetting that he is making an intervention. It sounds as though he is making a good point, but he is only intervening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Whatever else we do in this sitting, we shall play by the rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point of the right hon. Member. He has often paid tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member for Chelsea. I recognise that he was not suggesting that I had misled the House in any way. I was merely taking the opportunity to point out that I have not misled the House about the Bill, or any other, matter. It was the hon. Member for Monklands, West who mentioned charades and the possibility of the House being misled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to respond to the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East by referring to my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon, who asked, "Well, when a Government are opposed to a Bill, why don't we just vote against it? Why not be more straightforward about private Member's Bills?" I think that I have been straightforward in saying that the Government do not want the Bill to become law. The Government and I have been relatively indulgent with regard to the Bill's progress. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon thinks that we should have been more blunt about it, and used the voting system of the House to our advantage. I did not think that it was right to ask my hon. Friend to come to the House on a Friday in February to vote down a private Member's Bill. There is much to be said for discussing legislation and for having open debates on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also asked my right hon. Friend the Financial
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0102">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
Secretary to the Treasury to provide a money resolution in connection with the Bill. It is only a convention, but I did that to ensure that the debate would take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East moved his motion, he said quite straightforwardly that he wanted to get the Bill through the House in three days.—Perhaps he should have said two days and a bit, or even one day and a couple of bits—this morning, tomorrow, and whatever time is available on Friday on Report.—I notice that other business is already down for consideration on Friday. I do not think that it is a serious proposition to consider discussing in detail a Bill of 38 clauses and accompanying schedules in such a brief length of time. Bills should be discussed in detail. Many of the Bill's details are contentious and its objectives have, in my opinion, already been met in the Disability Discrimination Bill, which differs in important respects from this Bill. The Disability Discrimination Bill has been passed by the House of Commons, and it was extensively debated—the assiduity of the hon. Member for Monklands, West made sure of that. This Bill conflicts with the decisions that we made on that Bill, and it is controversial and contentious in many ways, as I will demonstrate later in our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill, should not pass through the House of Commons in one day and a couple of bits of days. The Committee on the Disability Discrimination Bill had 13 sittings over five weeks, in which 200 amendments were moved by people other than myself. I did not complain. The Report stage occurred four weeks after the conclusion of the Committee stage. Indeed, it was part of the understanding between the unusual channels—to which the hon. Member for Monklands, West referred—that there would be a decent interval between the Committee and the Report stages. As it turned out, the interval was longer than we agreed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Everyone agrees that the Minister is a very nice man. This morning, he is being nicest of all to himself. Does not what he just said confirm that the decency with which we approached the Government's Bill is not being emulated by the Government in their disgraceful treatment of the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly acknowledge that the hon. Gentleman approached the proceedings on the Government's Bill in a decent manner. I am pointing out that that decent manner of opposition involved 13 sittings of the Committee, between 30 hours and 40 hours of debate and a three-week interval between the Committee stage and the Report stage. Hon. Members are now saying that it is indecent of me to suggest that it is wrong to proceed with this Bill in three sittings and with a gap of only hours between the Committee stage and the Report stage. Some double standards have crept onto the Opposition Benches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are double standards. Is not it the reason that so much time was devoted in recent weeks to the Government's Bill because the Government were making it up as they went along? Indeed, only yesterday
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
the Prime Minister told the House that, in terms of enforcement, he was awaiting a recommendation from the national disability council, which has yet to be established. Is not it the case that, in contrast, that the details of the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill were recommended to the Government in a report 13 years ago and that the detailed Bill, promoted by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wythenshawe, has been available for the past four years? It is unreasonable for the Minister to try to compare the Bill with a Bill that the Government made up as they went along. That is not very nice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must not let "nice" become the Committee's favourite word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingswood makes a dubious point. He and his hon. Friends on the Committee who debated the Government's Bill often implored us to have an open mind, to think about accepting amendments and to reconsider some matters. When we do think again and introduce amendments to improve the Bill, we are accused of making it up as we go along and hon. Members say that we do not know what we are doing. The hon. Member is trying to win both sides of the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingswood said that the Bill was recommended and decided on 13 years ago. I assume that he was referring to the report by the Committee on Restrictions Against Disabled People, chaired by Sir Peter Large, or Mr. Large as he was then, which the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Corbett) often referred to when we discussed the Disability Discrimination Bill. In asking for legislation on disability discrimination, the report said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The main legislation should be amplified by detailed Regulations and Codes of Practice made under the authority of primary legislation, dealing with differing circumstances where discrimination would be prohibited or permitted. The Regulations and Codes of Practice would be legally enforceable by virtue of provisions in the primary legislation."</p></blockquote>
This Bill does not correspond to that recommendation. It provides few regulation-making powers. Although it contains provisions to establish codes of practice, they are generally not legally enforceable. It will not always be easy to quote in aid the report of 13 years ago because, although the Bill may be broadly modelled on that report, it is not exactly modelled on it. That does not mean that we should not consider the Bill in detail, but it will take longer than the time the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East proposes to set aside for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inherent in the argument put by the hon. Member for Kingswood and by, the right hon. Member for Wythenshawe was that because the Civil Rights Disabled Persons Bill has been debated for many years, we need not go through the details now. I do not think that that is the correct way to approach parliamentary proceedings. In my nine months as Minister for Social Security and Disabled People, I have had no more than a few hours in which to set out the Government's opinion on the Bill. In fact, the hon. Member for Monklands, West, cut me short on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0103">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
Second Reading, for understandable reasons, and moved the motion for closure. I was therefore able to give the Government's view on just a part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his understanding, but now that he is feeling so terribly sorry for himself about parliamentary time, will he agree that the Government had an advantage over us in that they spent £1 million on advertising and contriving media presentation from the time of their consultation document to the time when he made his speech?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The £1 million that we spent to raise awareness about disabled people was nothing to do with the Government's Bill, as the hon. Member for Erdington recognises. If the hon. Member for Monklands, West thinks that the Government can contrive to influence and control the media in that way, he has a very generous opinion of the Government's capabilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very briefly, Mr. Hogg. Will the Minister accept that there is some unfairness in what he has said? There is a fundamental difference between Government legislation and private Members' legislation. The Government have much more freedom in terms of time than private Members, as the hon. Member for Eltham will know from his experience. Recently, I was asked to give evidence to the Select Committee on Procedure and that was one of the points that I made most strongly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
His Bill was not short of parliamentary time, but there is little time left in which to try to push forward this Bill which has been debated at such length and so often.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a difference between the time and control of parliamentary proceedings available to the Government and to private Members when promoting Bills. That does not mean, however, that because there is not much time to discuss private Members' Bills, we should pass over them quickly without properly examining them. If we followed that argument to its logical conclusion, we would now say of the private Members' Bills remaining for consideration this Session that, because there is no time for discussion of them, we do not need to consider the Bills in detail, so we shall pass some of them. Bills, whoever their promoters, must go through detailed parliamentary scrutiny. People who bring forward private Members' Bills know that that is the case at the outset.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not he agree that it is bogus to say that because the measures have been discussed for 13 years, they need no further discussion? This year more than ever, the Bill needs discussion and analysis because the landscape has fundamentally changed as a result of the Government's Bill. There has been a material change in the background to the issues that we are discussing. Therefore, we need to discuss the matter further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. We are in a totally different situation from that which prevailed in previous years because the Government have promoted legislation of their own with the same objectives as those in the Civil
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill. We are in a radically different parliamentary and political situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If, as the hon. Member for High Peak said, the landscape has changed so remarkably, does not the Minister believe that organisations of and for disabled people might have a view? Will he tell us of one organisation that supports the Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly think that they might have a view, but there is a difference between saying that organisations that are concerned with an issue or a group of people should have their views represented, heard and debated in Parliament and saying that those views should automatically be adopted into legislation. That is the mistake that is being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Moses came to St. Stephen's entrance with a Bill written in tablets of stone, I should suggest that the Bill be at least gone through by a Committee of the House, to check whether it could be implemented in detail and would work in practice. Just because something has a stamp of approval from outside organisations, however worthy they may be and however interested they may have been for a long time in the subject, does not mean that Members of Parliament should sacrifice and abdicate their judgment to recommendations that are made in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The sittings motion, which we are discussing, does not prevent debate and scrutiny of the Bill. It will not achieve the objective that I should like, which would be that we have to finish by Thursday evening. I might wish for that to occur and hope that it will occur because of the way in which we deal with later amendments, but the sittings motion will not prevent detailed scrutiny. If we fail to finish by Thursday evening, it would allow us to continue scrutinising. There is no strength in the Minister's argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a reasonable point, but the hon. Gentleman presented the sittings motion as being a way of getting through the Committee stage tomorrow. That is its purpose and that is the timetable that he, as the Bill's promoter, has set out so that there can be a Report stage on Friday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. The Minister referred to outside organisations. Does he mean that, for example, Rachel Hurst, who was honoured by Her Majesty, at the Government's recommendation, in the last honours list, is an outside person? Will he assure me that, when we meet, as we often do, at receptions of Scope and Mencap, for example, he will describe them as outside organisations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rachel Hurst, who is a splendid lady whom I much admire, is outside this body. Legislative decisions must be made by Members of Parliament. The hon. Member for Kingswood will be familiar with the history of such thinking, as he comes from the Bristol area and it was Edmund Burke who said that a Member of Parliament betrays rather than serves his constituents when he sacrifices his judgment to their opinion. That was the point that I was trying to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0104">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not there another point? Of course it is true that anyone who is not a Member of Parliament is an outsider, but there is more than one group of people who have an interest in the matter. Of course those who will benefit from the legislation are enthusiastic supporters of it; that is not surprising. There are other people who will be affected by the Bill and they, too, have an interest. I am thinking particularly of those who will have to bear the costs. As Members of Parliament, it is right that we should consider and balance those interests in reaching a conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. One of the Government's major concerns about the Bill is that it is unfair to people other than those with whom it is primarily concerned. In not being fair, it damages the likelihood of its achieving its objective, as it will turn people against legislation rather than encouraging them to work with legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jean Corston 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the fact that the Confederation of British Industry, for example, has welcomed the Bill, will the Minister say whose interests he is representing in opposing it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady could find many concerns. Some of them are recorded in the Red Book, with which she is thoroughly familiar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One company only wanted a small firm exemption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. On a range of issues, many organisations would be concerned about the detail of the Bill. The hon. Lady must consider not only organisations but the reaction of those, who may not be members of organisation, whose co-operation and willingness to implement the legislation will be absolutely critical to its success. We, as Members of Parliament, must judge how measures will work in practice. That is one of the issues involved in debating the Bill. I digress from the sittings motion. I am being tempted away from it by such interventions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to what I have said about the need to consider such matters in Committee, one could ask whether they matter in this case. Given the fact that the Bill will not become law—I know of no hon. Member who thinks that it will become law—one could ask whether it matters that we might have only a relatively brief debate in Committee. One might say "Let us have a brief debate in Committee and let us use Friday as an opportunity for debate." But that is not the right way to approach such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to look at the detail. Given the fact that such matters have been discussed for so long, it is right for the Government and me to say which details in the Bill are wrong. Some concepts in the Bill are uncertain or mistakenly constructed. It is right to consider such matters in a level of detail that does justice to the Bill, to those who have drafted it and to those who have sponsored it or similar measures in previous sessions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given my hon. Friend's eagerness to scrutinise the Bill in detail and given the fact that we have now debated the sittings motion for nearly an hour and a half, will he agree that it might be appropriate to conclude the debate so that we can proceed with that scrutiny?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will endeavour to do so as quickly as possible. But I must be able to respond to many of the points that many hon. Members have raised during the debate. I want the Committee to understand that I think that the Bill should be debated. I am willing to debate the Bill in detail on a succession of Wednesdays. I would find it difficult to debate the Bill on other days because the Pensions Bill, of which I am the Minister in charge, will sit on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Ministers have often been called to debate such measures on a succession of Wednesdays. That would be in line with the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Minister for Beaconsfield.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We might agree about substantial matters, and I might not object to parts of the Bill. There might be disagreements about technical matters. The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East has referred to some of them. I have tabled some drafting amendments. I have tabled some amendments that attempt to improve the way in which the Bill would work if it became law. I doubt whether the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East, or other hon. Members, would not want to accept some of the amendments. That is one of my worries about quickly passing over such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North East is not saying that no amendment—no improvement—can be made to the Bill. One sometimes has the impression that people say that, because such matters have been talked about for so many years, nothing can be done to improve the Bill. It is as though we were listening to the Duke of Wellington talking about the British constitution before the 1832 Reform Act, and saying that it was so perfect and had been perfect for so long that no improvement was possible. The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East does not always strike me as being like the Duke of Wellington, but there is a passing similarity in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the passage of the Disability Discrimination Bill, we made several important changes. We debated matters such as the provisions on transport and education, which were changed as a result of the discussion and the representations made during the Bill's passage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Bill is similarly complex, with detailed interaction between clauses and several concepts new to English law. It is likely that the Bill contains provisions that all members of the Committee would want to alter and improve. If it reaches its Report stage on Friday, no one expects it to pass that stage successfully. I am therefore puzzled about why a great effort should be made to confine the debate in Committee to one day, rather than allowing the Committee to take time over the next few weeks to consider the provisions in detail. That would also allow my hon. Friend the Minister for Eltham, who explained that he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0105">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
could not be present tomorrow because of other commitments, to attend and to share his expertise as a former Transport Minister when we discuss transport provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, if the Committee is expected seriously to scrutinise the matter, it cannot make a judgment about what will happen on Report and Third Reading. It must assume that those stages will be taken seriously; otherwise, the work of the Committee would be unimportant. What we are doing is important, and subsequent stages will also be important, although it might be difficult to reach them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman, but he argued for the sittings motion on the basis that a Report stage on Friday was the only conceivable way in which the Bill could make further progress. I do not dispute what he said or his sincerity in saying it. I do not mind whether the Bill reaches Report stage on Friday, but we know that it will not progress beyond that stage, so we might as well take the time to debate it properly in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How about my proposal that the promoter of the Bill and the Minister get together and discuss whether part IV and schedule 2 can be taken forward? Access to polling stations and the step-by-step approach would not frighten anyone, would mark progress in this year's efforts on the Bill and would be acceptable to the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always ready to meet the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East and to discuss anything in his Bill. My hon. Friend will understand that, having given many months' consideration to their own Bill and taken that Bill through the House of Commons, the Government have a clear idea of the body of legislation that they prefer and that they think would work. Nevertheless, I am always open to meetings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend could confirm, I think, that the code of practice, the audit and the provisions that within two years half the polling stations should be accessible and that within five years all should be accessible were not in his Bill and could be adopted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would get into trouble if I started to debate the merits of those clauses now. I shall offer my thoughts on them when we reach them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the contribution of the hon. Member for Eltham indicate that when we reach part VI, the Minister will not oppose it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not necessarily an indication of anything, except that I am happy to meet hon. Members. I do not anticipate that I would oppose every clause of the Bill, but you, Mr. Hogg, would not want me to tell the Committee now what will be my approach to every clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While it would be unreasonable to ask the hon. Gentleman to respond to the Government at
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
this stage, can he at least say what he personally thinks of part VI? Does he support it, at least in principle?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will indicate my attitude to part VI when we reach it. We must now continue our debate of the sittings motion, but we shall reach part VI eventually—tomorrow or later. We shall undoubtedly come to it in due course. It does not make for good law if the Committee stage of a complex and controversial Bill is completed in a day and a half and the Report stage is taken on the following day. That is bound to lead to things being passed over. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East or the House authorities would have the opportunity to reprint the Bill between the Committee stage and Report if amendments had been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister has chosen to ignore what hon. Members have said. If the Government had persuaded the hon. Member for Rochford that the Committee considering the Road Traffic (New Drivers) Bill should report last Friday, which it was quite free to do, the whole of the coming Friday would be available for the sort of debate that the Minister says he wants. He says how difficult it would be to do what my hon. Friend suggests. May I gently remind him that I was the author of the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986? I had the opportunity of only two Committee sittings—morning and afternoon—followed by Report, but we accepted the relevance of another place, which the Minister has not mentioned. What he calls difficult is not at all difficult, as my experience shows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. Could you advise hon. Members about the important question raised by the Minister? Will it be necessary for hon. Members to table amendments for the Report stage by tonight if they are not to be starred? If so, and the Bill is subsequently amended, hon. Members who are not members of the Committee who are unhappy with amendments made in the Committee will not know of them in time to table further amendments on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Andrew Bowden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. I am right that if we agree the sittings motion we could sit all night on Thursday? If so, what would be the deadline—this fits in with my hon. Friend's point of order—to ensure that the Bill takes first place on Friday morning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the latter point is that the deadline is the rising of the House tomorrow evening. In answer to the former point, my understanding is that amendments could be tabled. It would be at the discretion of Madam Speaker whether they were taken as manuscript amendments. I hope that that clarifies the position. I am not sure that I understand it myself, but it sounds right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. My hon. Friend also asked whether, if the Bill were to complete its Committee stage in time, it would be first on Friday? I think that it would come after those measures that have already completed their Committee stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0106">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two other measures ahead of the Bill. That would be the position on Friday morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole Committee will be grateful for that clarification. However, hon. Members can understand why I raised the question about the implications of the sittings motion. From the Government's point of view, I am relatively relaxed about whether we conclude our proceedings tomorrow and discuss the Bill on Report on Friday, even though it would be after we had discussed two other Bills. I have already had the opportunity to consider what amendments I would table. However, I am not sure that other hon. Members would be in that fortunate position. As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield said, some matters would be sprung on hon. Members and that would be an unfortunate way in which to make law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also unfair of the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East not to recognise that not only has my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham other commitments tomorrow, but other members of the Committee serve on other standing Committees that will meet tomorrow. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield is a member of the Committee that will be considering the Gas Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for High Peak is a member of the Standing Committee that is considering the Child Support Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rochdale, who is out of the Room temporarily, will also be serving on the Committee that will consider the Child Support Bill tomorrow. The hon. Lady made many contributions, many of which were praised by the hon. Member for Monklands, West, to our proceedings on the Disability Discrimination Bill, but, given her other commitments, she will be absent from our proceedings tomorrow morning, which will cover an important part of the Bill. If she does attend, however, she will be excluded from being the sole representative of the Liberal Democrat party in the committee that is considering the Child Support Bill. That must put her in a difficult position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend remember that, in the debate on the sittings motion on the Disability Discrimination Bill, the hon. Member for Rochdale said that it was inappropriate that we should sit in the afternoon because she had other Committee engagements and because she needed more time to prepare her arguments? Is it not strange that, having argued that way on one Bill she now seeks to argue in an entirely different way on this Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: She is a Liberal Democrat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for High Peak is right. There are mitigating circumstances, to one of which my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham referred. Consistency is not normally a virtue which we associate with members of the Liberal Democrat party. I can say that easily, given that no Liberal Democrats are in the Room at the moment. It is slightly unfair to the hon. Member for Rochdale to keep referring to her in her absence, so I shall change the subject. However, as my hon. Friend the
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
Member for High Peak rightly reminded me, the hon. Lady asked during the first week of the Committee's proceedings on the Disability Discrimination Bill that it should not sit at a certain time when there was to be a debate on the Floor of the House in which she wanted to participate. We ensured that the Committee did not sit at that time and the hon. Lady was able to take part in both the Committee proceedings and in the debate on the Floor of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that there is a dangerous presence of numerous crocodiles making their way up the Thames and finding tears in the Committee. If the Minister has so much regard for the views of the hon. Member for Rochdale, why did he not accept one—not one—of her amendments to the Disability Discrimination Bill and why he did not agree with her short speech today?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I shall take a hand in the proceedings now. The hon. Member for Rochdale has been discussed at great length in her absence which, as the Minister recognised, is a little discourteous. She is entitled to respond to what is being said about her. I want the Committee to move off that subject and to get back to the important matter of whether the Committee should meet tomorrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are so right, Mr. Hogg. I wish to make it clear that the Government are not opposed to such measures. That is obvious from the fact that we introduced the Disability Discrimination Bill, which has already been approved by the House. We are opposed to the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill because it is too vague and inflexible. It pays little regard to the costs that it would impose on society as a whole, which was a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield. It is likely to be counterproductive and it will not achieve its laudable intentions. It is important that members of the Committee are free to address what may be uncomfortable questions. It is easy to be carried away by high-sounding aspirations and to suppose that, because the Bill is supported by many people it should proceed with all possible speed. It is the business of a Standing Committee to test whether policy intentions have been given practical effect in a suitably worded Bill which will work in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tabled a range of amendments aimed at improving the drafting of the Bill and giving the Committee an opportunity to explore how the Bill might operate if it were put into practice. Discussion of the amendments will reveal flaws in the drafting and it is right to have sufficient time to develop the themes that will emerge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the Bill has been lifted from the Americans with Disabilities Act, but it lacks the back-up of secondary legislation to fill out the details, as has been necessary in the United States. Too much reliance has been placed on codes of practice to be issued by the disability rights commission, which will not be legally binding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The imperfect blending of the ADA approach with provisions lifted from the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0107">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
the Race Relations Act 1976 has a strange effect in creating a law which might be difficult to bring into force in practice. For example, the ADA has specific escape clauses for health and safety risks, but there are no such clauses in this Bill, which relies solely on the definition of a qualified disabled person who needs the essential requirements for the provision of a service. Not enough thought has been given to how the Bill would work in practice and how costs would be contained within sensible limits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is insisting on the importance of legislation specifying in detail what is to be provided. In that case, why have the Government adopted a completely different approach in the Jobseekers Bill? That Bill, it has been argued, is little more than a framework Bill, leaving a great deal of important detail to be supplied in subsequent regulation. Such an approach makes it impossible for Parliament to scrutinise those elements of the Bill when primary legislation is being passed. We all know of the severe limitations on the capacity of Parliament to scrutinise regulations and statutory instruments at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difference is that the regulation-making powers in the Jobseekers Bill give the Government the opportunity to expand on the law in the future and change it if necessary, with Parliament having the chance to express its approval of disapproval. Much of the important flexibility in the Disability Discrimination Bill comes from the many regulation-making powers which enable the Government and Parliament to learn from any difficulties that the Bill encounters and clarify definitions and matters such as the responsibilities of service providers and employers. In this Bill, however, no role for the Government is envisaged in bringing forward codes of practice, and those codes would not be legally binding on courts. We are asked to hand over vague powers to a commission and to the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. Are we not moving way beyond the sittings motion by discussing amendments that will be moved later by the Minister?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I may be entitled to point out that we have wandered far from the sittings motion on many occasions this morning. I am sure that the Minister will return to the sittings motion and, who knows, perhaps we shall make a decision on it at some point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. Hogg. I was responding to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Minister for Stratford-on-Avon, but I hope that we shall have other opportunities to discuss such matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I be clear about what my hon. Friend the Minister is saying? Is he saying that, because of the way in which the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East has constructed his Bill—which is based on American precedents and United Kingdom precedents in other discrimination legislation—it is a bit of a hotch-potch which therefore needs to be examined in detail?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am saying that. My hon. Friend has shown much more cleverly than I had done that the point is relevant to the sittings motion because it demonstrates that detailed consideration is required. It is wrong to try to consider the Bill in one day when it raises complex matters to which there is not just one right answer, but different views that need to be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's underlying purpose merits praise; many of the detailed proposals deserve rejection, although they deserve consideration. I hope that that can be done at a slightly more measured pace than the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East set out in the sittings motion. His sittings motion is futile and will not lead to the Bill becoming law. I do not criticise him for pushing his Bill forward, but there is a lot to be said for proceeding differently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A good argument has been ruined by taking it too far and it is a shame to see some of its earliest proponents trapped in a rigid orthodoxy in which amendments are not welcome and the Government's views are cast aside in the course of a day. That is not a constructive approach. I prefer the approach of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield in his amendment to the sittings motion and I shall support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join my colleagues on both sides of the Committee in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Hogg, and I thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak. It was a surprise to discover that a monstrous, unholy alliance had decided that I should not be allowed to speak in Committee and I am grateful for your protection, Mr. Hogg. This is not the first time that that has happened. When I first stood for Parliament my agent had not scheduled me to speak at any public meetings. When I asked why, he said that it was better for people to wonder why I do not speak than to wonder why I do. A preference for silence may be understandable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only matter on which the Committee is likely to reach agreement is that my hon. Friend the Minister for Social Security and Disabled People is a nice and helpful man. So nice and helpful is he that he has agreed to be an usher at my wedding in July, which is perhaps the ultimate role reversal between a PPS and his Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is getting off the subject. The groom and the usher will be required to arrive on time and time is what we are discussing, so perhaps the hon. Gentleman will return to the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do so, Mr. Hogg.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our debate has been extraordinary, starting with the comments of the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East, who tried to stifle discussion on the Bill and suggested that the rules were unfair. When the hon. Gentleman entered the ballot, he knew the rules and accepted them. They sometimes work in favour of hon. Members and sometimes against, but the hon. Gentleman was fully aware of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the general drift of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0108">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
my hon. Friend's comments, but to table a motion suggesting an extra day of debate is not stifling debate. The purpose was to make a further debate possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East wanted to push the Bill through quickly rather than have detailed discussion of it. He was trying to stifle debate. In addition, when he chose the subject of his Bill he knew of the existence of a Government Bill on a similar subject. Despite that, he decided to introduce his own Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. The hon. Gentleman is challenging Madam Speaker's ruling when she made it plain that there was no reason why my hon. Friend's Bill and the Government's Bill should not be considered at the same time. The hon. Gentleman should withdraw his comment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly not rule on that. Madam Speaker's rulings in the House are her affair entirely. It would be bordering on the impudent to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that those rulings were even being discussed. Not for a moment was I seeking to challenge Madam Speaker's ruling but merely to question the judgment of the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East in choosing this issue as the subject for his Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only judgment on which I have been suspect was in recommending the hon. Gentleman to come on to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel that I can only endorse my view that his judgment may be suspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that disabled groups would be seriously annoyed by what has happened in the Committee. I have to tell him that is not so. When this measure was introduced last year we were inundated with letters from disabled people within our constituencies and from charities and other groups, explaining why we should back the Bill. As of now, I have received only two letters from constituents telling me why I should back the Bill at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a valid point that is worthy of discussion. However unlike almost every other hon. Member and the charities, he has not taken on board the role of the Charities Commission and the existence of the Nolan committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. However, he will recall that when we discussed the Disability Discrimination Bill, in every post we received
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
from charities advising us of their legitimate concerns and explaining why we should vote for or against the amendment. I have not received a single missive from a charity explaining why it supports or does not support the measures proposed by my hon. Friend the Minister. I know many of the people involved and many of their public affairs spokesmen. However, I have yet to receive a single letter advising me about their concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that, following the consultation exercise organised by the Government in the summer, of those respondents—be they companies, voluntary organisations or individuals—who offered an opinion on the merits of the Government's Bill in comparison with the Civil Rights (Disabled People) Bill, 98 per cent. preferred the latter? How many times do we have to wait around for more comment when the public have made it clear what they want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Member for High Peak answers that point, it might be convenient for the Committee if I remind its members that we are debating whether we should discuss this matter on Wednesdays or whether we should discuss it today and tomorrow. Those propositions are simple and straightforward but, for some reason that I do not understand, they are not being addressed. I hope that the hon. Member for High Peak will return to the subject of the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your ruling, Mr. Hogg. I have been trying to pick up some of the points that other hon. Members have made during our debate. If they have been straying from the motion, I apologise on their behalf as well. However, I have been trying to respond to their points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may debate the Bill tomorrow or on future Wednesdays but there is also a concern that we are trying to turn it into the Government's Bill. When we debated the Disability Discrimination Bill it was clear that Opposition Members were trying to turn it into the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill. It is legitimate, therefore, to table an amendment that seeks to change the Bill into something more acceptable to those sitting on the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to differ from the views expressed by the right hon. Member for Manchester, Wynthenshawe (Mr. Morris). He said that any strangers who looked at the Committee would be shocked by what they saw.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I did not say that. I never used the words, "would be shocked". I said that the stranger would only have to look at the two sides of the Committee to see that one is comprehensively all-party and that the other is not. I was speaking about that in support of the point that there was a clear majority for the Bill in the previous Parliament as there is in this Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not mean to provoke the right hon. Gentleman into making an intervention. As things stand, it seems as if some Labour Members are trying to filibuster, and to delay discussion of the Bill. I understand the right hon. Gentleman's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0109">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
The people who are observing the Committee are not predominantly representative of the disabled lobby nor of the press that looks after the interests of disabled people. Observers of the Committee are often researchers or members of the Opposition Whips Office. There is not the same interest in the Bill this year as there has been in similar matters previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key issue—which I must come to immediately, because I see that you, Mr. Hogg, are looking at the ceiling with an expression of despair on your face—is the time that is needed to discuss the changes, and the appropriate way to do that. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield is absolutely right to say that the Bill needs careful and detailed consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rochdale made a valid point during the debate on the sittings motion of the Disability Discrimination Bill. I assure members of the Committee that neither I nor my fellow Back Bench hon. Friends are getting official or unofficial briefing. We have to do our own research and homework. We need time to do that with justice, and to do it properly, which is what our constituents and others who look at our proceedings would expect us to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said during the speech of my hon. Friend the Minister that the situation now is very different from that which held previously. There has been considerable debate on this subject in previous years. We are now considering the issue and the Bill's proposals in a different light. The Government's Bill moves forward the interests of disabled people in a way that has not happened before in our history. We therefore must give this Bill careful consideration, and we must do so thoroughly. If the Bill were rushed through in the next day and a half, we should not be representing the views of our constituents or of disabled pressure groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I pursued that matter further, I should risk straying from the sittings motion, and I should be loath to do that. I therefore urge members of the Committee to support the amendment that was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, because it would give us enough time to give the Bill full and careful consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall put the question on the manuscript amendment first, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly agreed to. Resolved.</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That during proceedings on the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill the Committee do meet tomorrow at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East to move the motion on the order of consideration, I remind the Committee that there is a money resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room. I also remind hon. Members of the need to give sufficient notice of amendments. As a general rule, starred amendments will not be called.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Barnes: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Bill be considered in the following order: Clauses 1 to 3, Schedule 1, Clauses 4 to 20, Schedule 2, Clauses 21 to 38, new Clauses, new Schedules.</p></blockquote>
The motion is straightforward. It will be convenient for the Committee to deal with measures as they appear in the Bill. I have resisted the temptation to introduce a motion that would allow parts I and VI to be dealt with first, although no serious amendments are tabled to them at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the promoter of the Bill has now made a mistake. Whether he was right to go for the whole Bill to fulfil an ambition, is a matter for him. Having reached this stage, however, it is plain that the Bill, in its entirety, will not reach the Floor of the House by Friday. The hon. Gentleman would be well advised to accept my amendment to the order of consideration, which I intend to move later although I will not push it to a vote if that is against the mood of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would prefer to take clause 20 first, followed by schedule 2, and then the remaining clauses in Part VI. That would deal with the polling station provisions and the code of practice. The proposed time scale is reasonable. No unnecessary elements of public expenditure could not properly be met over the period of two to five years. The provisions are sensible and are a new addition to civil rights legislation. Accepting them would be a tribute to the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East, who has fought for civil rights and for people's ability to vote through registration and easy access to polling stations. I ask the hon. Gentleman to give my proposal serious consideration during the remaining minutes of this morning's sitting</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because my earlier contributions were interventions, I did not have the opportunity to welcome you, Mr. Hogg, as Chairman. Your reputation has already grown in the minds of all of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eltham made a suggestion contrary to the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my suggestion was not heard in detail until after the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East had spoken, I am not absolutely certain that what the hon. Gentleman says is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to tell the hon. Gentleman why I believe that I am right. I do not think that he or the Government have the right that they have exercised this morning to interfere, quite unreasonably—I am delighted that the Committee has rebelled against it—with the way in which a private Member, within the procedure of the House, conducts his presentation of a Bill. What we saw earlier was absolutely monstrous. In my time in the House—not all that long, but since 1982—I have never seen the Government and their supporters display such impertinence by standing in the way of the wishes of an hon. Member who has been successful enough—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I suspect that being called unreasonable is in order, but to describe my behaviour as monstrous, when all I did was draw attention to the sittings motion that I had not previously noticed, which would require the Bill to go through its Committee stage tomorrow when I am unable to be here, strikes me as testing the limits of propriety in speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with what the hon. Gentleman says and I think that we are in danger of becoming immoderate in describing one another's attitudes
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
in Committee. I hope that the hon. Members will stick to the merits of arguments and try and express their arguments in a way that is consistent with good parliamentary practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that you, Mr. Hogg, are absolutely right. I am sure that when the hon. Member for Eltham reads 	<i>Hansard</i> he will find that when I used the word "monstrous", I was referring to the Government. That view is widely held throughout the country and I do not see why I should be inhibited from expressing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To move on to serious issues, my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East was successful in the ballot; something that is not easily attained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, on the one occasion when I was successful, Willie Hamilton, who was then the hon. Member for Fife, Central, rebuked me because he had been in the House for 30 years and had never got into the top 10. It is very important that once an hon. Member has been recognised in that way, he should not feel that the use of procedure is an impediment to him going about his business. My hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East has sought to co-operate with the Government, but we have not seen a single effort on the Government's part to respond to that co-operation. That is why we shall debate the Bill in the way that we are doing this week and present it, I hope, on Friday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main point is that the hon. Member for Eltham—with respect, the Minister did not seem to go quite so far—seemed to accept that the Bill would get nowhere and would not be debated. No member or Committee has the right to expect that. Let us proceed with the Bill in the way that my hon. Friend suggests. Between this House and the other place we could produce not just a splendid Bill, but a splendid Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Andrew Bowden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East will accept the sincerity of the comments that I am about to make. I believe that my record shows that I am sincere, having voted in favour of the Bill on Second Reading, and having voted for us to sit tomorrow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the hon. Gentleman reconsider his order of consideration?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if we sit tomorrow for a full morning sitting, as we shall, and rise at half-past 10 or 11 o'clock tomorrow night, we clearly have little prospect of dealing with more than a small proportion of the amendments that have been tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should concentrate our debates on those areas that I very much hope the Minister will take on board. I am sad that the Bill has almost no chance of reaching the statute book, but we should face that regrettable reality. I hope that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East will take my comments in the spirit in which they are meant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask a brief question of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0111">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East about the order of consideration. To respond to the hon. Member for Monklands, West, I do not think that it was impertinent or monstrous to debate any of the issues that we have debated this morning. In fairness to myself, I should point out that the debate on the sittings motion was briefer than that on the Disability Discrimination Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not quite convinced that the proposed order of consideration is the most sensible one, although the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East may well be able to convince me. My worry is about the position of clause 3 and schedule 1, which deal with the setting up and the running of a disability rights commission. That bears on how the rights in the Bill should be implemented and policed. I wonder whether it is right to ask the Committee to consider those secondary—albeit important—issues before the primary issue of what rights are to be implemented and policed have been decided. The hon. Members for Monklands, West and for Birmingham, Erdington will remember that, when considering the Disability Discrimination Bill, we discussed the national disability council and all the issues relating to enforcement after we had debated those parts of the Bill that set out rights and anti-discrimination provisions. It seemed logical to do so, though perhaps it was more obvious in that case because that Bill was set out in that order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that it would be helpful to both sides of the Committee if he could say now whether at any time he will be prepared to withdraw any of the amendments tabled in his name, which, as he knows, the Committee now has scant time to consider?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot anticipate that. I shall want to listen to the arguments put by the hon. Members for Derbyshire, North-East. I have not intention at present to withdraw amendments in advance, although when one has tabled amendments they are under constant review. I may well want to withdraw some amendments during the proceedings because some of them are probing amendments intended to elicit an explanation of what is intended and some amendments may have compelling arguments presented against them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to my point about the order of consideration, there is a logic to considering what rights are to be established before considering how they should be enforced. For example, clauses 4, 5, 10 and 11 confer new employment rights, clauses 12 to 15 deal with rights of access to goods and services, clauses 16 to 19 set out requirements affecting property and buildings and clauses 20 to 25 cover access to polling stations, but we are being asked to discuss in advance how those rights will be enforced and policed. I am not unpersuadable on the matter—the hon. Gentleman may have perfectly good reasons—but, from my initial reading I suggest that the order is illogical. It would be better to discuss the clauses to which I referred—and perhaps others covering employment agencies, qualifying bodies, partnerships and trade unions—before considering the role of a commission in advising on and policing the provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
Will the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East consider that approach, which is more reasonable and logical, and will he explain why he chose to discuss the Bill in the order that he suggested?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the motion. I listened carefully to my hon. Friend the Minister and I see the logic of his argument, but I think we can proceed in the way proposed by the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East. I am not happy with the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) to bring forward part VI on access to polling stations. The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East designed the Bill and wants to proceed with it the way that he perceives to be logical. We should not upset that arrangement unless there is good reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter was raised on Second Reading and some hon. Members were not happy about the hon. Gentlemen's proposal. We cannot now discuss the merits of access to polling stations, but reservations were expressed and I am not keen to give it priority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I explain briefly two reasons why that matter should be discussed first? First, I am in the Committee today but will not be here tomorrow. I care about the provision and I have supported the hon. Gentlemen's efforts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second reason is a practical one. I suspect that the whole Bill will not return to the Floor of the House by Friday, but if part VI and schedule 2 on accessibility audits—that is an integral part of the provisions covering access to polling stations—were discussed first, it might be possible for some meritorious parts of the Bill to proceed. At the moment, the chances of the Bill being considered in Committee and returning to the Floor of the House are slim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend wants to discuss that matter today, I had better sit down now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I tabled the order of consideration, I thought that I was being uncontroversial and helpful to the Committee. I appreciate the helpful suggestions from the hon. Members for Eltham and for Kemptown. The clause covering access to polling stations was taken from a previous private Member's Bill when I was successful in the ballot two years ago, but the Bill did not get as far as Committee. It is perhaps uniquely my contribution to the development of the legislation before us and was part of general provisions covering methods of electoral registration. It seemed to me that access for disabled people to polling stations would improve voting provisions for others. I am willing to talk to the Minister about that, but I do not believe that it is acceptable to the Government. It was certainly not acceptable two years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kemptown said that it would be useful to change the order to concentrate on matters that the Minister might take on board. There is a difficulty with that because I am not aware of matters that the Minister is likely to take on board. If he were willing to take on board
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0112">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
matters such as access to polling stations, I should be happy for him to do so, but I believe that the Government are concerned mainly to block the Bill and to change it into their own Bill as much as they can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is easier generally, if the order of debate follows the format of the Bill. It is easier for those involved to understand the arguments that have been developed and there would be some logic to the procedure. The Bill starts with definitions—who should be considered as disabled people—and then deals with the commission and the enforcement agency. Several enforceable matters that come later build upon the definitions offered in part I. There is logic in considering definitions first, then details of the matters to be covered, followed by enforcement. That order of consideration does not outweigh the convenience to the Committee of debating the Bill in order. It does not present any difficulties, because the commission itself has been the subject of considerable discussion in the House and it is at the heart of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to labour the point, but what is the difficulty in putting part II—clause 3—and the associated schedule in a different place in the order of consideration? It may be momentarily confusing to Members of the Committee, but I am sure that we could cope. I understand why the Bill follows a particular order, but there are valid reasons to debate it in a different order. I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman has persuaded the Committee that the Bill should be debated in the order he has proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have argued that it is best that our debates follow the order of the Bill. It causes no great difficulty to debate first the important elements of definition and enforcement, followed by details about such matters as
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
employment. That should not be awkward. In a sense, the sittings motion could have put us into a more awkward position, but that was not my doing but was caused by other circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, a manuscript amendment:
	<br><blockquote><p>That the order of consideration be amended as follows:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>in line 1, leave out from "namely" to "new" in line 2 and insert "Clause 20, Schedule 2, Clauses 21 to 25, Clauses 1 to 3, Schedule 1, Clauses 4 to 19, Clauses 26 to 38."</p></blockquote>
If the amendment is accepted, we could debate first the clauses on polling stations with the appropriate schedule and the Bill might get through. If the Government have objections, they can move amendments on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Manuscript amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Main Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
