	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following: Amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 22, after'1948', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) a person in charge of—
	<ol>
	<li>any dog while being used for sporting purposes,</li>
	<li>any dog while being used for the capture or destruction of vermin,</li>
	<li>any dog while being used for the driving or tending of cattle or sheep,</li>
	<li>any dog while being used on official duties by a member of Her Majesty's Armed Forces or Her Majesty's Customs and Excise or the police force for an area, or</li>
	<li>any dog while being used in emergency rescue work'.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
Amendment (a) to the proposed amendment, in paragraph (b)(iv) after 'area', delete 'or'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment (b) to the proposed amendment, at end of paragraph (b) add—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(vi) any dog while being used to assist a person with hearing impairment, or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(vii) any dog while being used to assist any person for whom there is a medical or therapeutic need for such assistance.'.</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 3, in page 1, line 22, after '1948', insert

	<br><blockquote><p>() any person who due to his medical condition cannot reasonably be expected to remove of dispose of the faeces.'.</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 5, in page 1, line 22, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'() It shall be a defence to a prosecution for an offence under this section to show that, at the time of the defecation, the dog was being used for a purpose specified in an order made by the Secretary of State.'</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Thomason 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bromsgrove)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee will be relieved to know that I had almost finished speaking when time prevented me from continuing last week. I had answered most of the points made by the hon. Member for Burnley (Mr. Pike) and dealt with most of the provisions of amendment No. 2, moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North (Mr. Elletson). I was about to speak to the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment (b) would add to the list given in amendment No. 2 dogs used to assist people with a hearing impairment or people with a medical or therapeutic need for such assistance. I do not know how a dog could help a person with a hearing impairment. I know that dogs fulfil a useful purpose for a limited number of people with specific hearing defects, but it is difficult to understand how that provision could be applied, any why such people should not be required to clear up any mess left by their dogs. Such people are not otherwise disabled and would know whether a dog had performed. The amendment is not appropriate. I apologise to my hon. Friend, but I cannot support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, why should not people with a "medical or therapeutic need" for the assistance of a dog be expected to deal with faeces left by their dogs. Unlike blind people, who could see what was required of them, those mentioned in amendments (a) and (b) can see and do not necessarily have an impairment that would prevent them clearing up a mess. I cannot support amendment (b).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 3 is about people aged 65 or over. Other hon. Members have commented on it and I agree with them that such people are usually quite capable of clearing up dog mess. Indeed, many people of that age are absolutely correct and carry a pooper-scooper. They are beacons of good behaviour and should not be included because it suggests that they cannot cope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 4 would include in that list
	<br><blockquote><p>"any person who due to his medical condition cannot reasonably be expected to remove or dispose of the faeces."</p></blockquote>
Such people are already covered in the Bill and the arguments were fully rehearsed at the previous sitting. Clause (1)(a) states that a person shall be guilty of the offence of failing to clear up the mess unless "he has a reasonable excuse".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is unduly repetitious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before you accuse me of being unduly repetitious, Mr. Hill, I shall sit down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Sir Paul Beresford)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Welcome back to this illustrious Committee, Mr. Hill. We have had an interesting discussion and I have listened carefully to hon. Members' succinct comments on the amendment. I noted with interest that the manuscript amendment appeared before us only to disappear fairly rapidly. We did not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0271">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
receive a full explanation of why the hon. Member for Burnley wanted to withdraw the manuscript amendment and he does not seem to be interested in giving us a fuller explanation this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter L. Pike 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Burnley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I withdrew the amendment because, having listened to the debate, I wanted to expedite the Committee's business. I said that I believed that all the exemptions that were included in the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Blackpool, North last Wednesday were covered by the original provisions of the Bill and that I should vote against the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his explanation. His amendment enabled us to discuss various items, including elephants and llamas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have considerable sympathy with the idea of exemptions for persons clearing up after working dogs, but I am not so convinced about the exemption for persons with hearing impairment, although an interesting case was put on that. I am not convinced about exemptions for persons in charge of other assistance dogs, nor am I sure that it is sensible to have a blanket exemption for all dog owners aged 65 or over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the concerns of hon. Members about those categories of people but I should say that clause 1(1)(a) provides for a defence of reasonable excuse, as was mentioned by some of my hon. Friends who are concerned that the amendment goes beyond what is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The defence of reasonable excuse will, in many cases, provide an appropriate safeguard, although it would, of course, be for the courts to decide whether a person had a reasonable excuse in the light of the circumstances of the case. Questions were asked about whether particular circumstances would amount to reasonable excuse for failing to remove dog droppings from land. As my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool North said—and as as I have repeated—it would be for the courts to decide whether there were grounds for reasonable excuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may have thought that the term "reasonable excuse" was not unfamiliar and that it may already be on the statute book. A computer search revealed that the phrase "reasonable excuse" has occurred 957 times in more than 400 statutes and statutory instruments during the past 150 years. I suggest that the words are familiar to the courts and, therefore, should not give rise to insurmountable difficulties in interpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interpretation of the phrase necessarily depends on its context. There are numerous cases on its meaning under various statutes, such as reasonable excuse for failing to give a blood or urine sampler under road traffic legislation—I am sure that no Committee member would be in that difficulty. There are also reported cases of reasonable excuse for not making a child attend school; for failing to give the invoice required by statute on a sale Of fertiliser; for non-vaccination of a child; for desertion of a
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
spouse; for non-production of a receipt for rent; for carrying a firearm or offensive weapon, and for failure to comply with a local authority nuisance order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are examples of cases that have come before the appeal courts. Magistrates may well have had to consider similar examples. They may also have had to consider reasonable excuse in relation to dog droppings because the phrase appears in some of the byelaws on the subject. Magistrates have been using their experience and common sense for a great many years to reach sensible results in a wide variety of situations, and I am sure that they will be able to take dog droppings in their stride, if the Committee will excuse the phrase. I hope that the Committee will forgive me if I decline to speculate on what their decisions might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the exception of amendment No. 5, I am not convinced that the amendments before us are technically correct. Amendment No. 1, taken with amendment No. 2, would mean that the words "a person" appear twice in the categories added by amendment No. 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More importantly, I am advised that amendment No.2 is defective because the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"while being used for sporting purposes",</p></blockquote>
or any of the other purposes mentioned, relate to the person, not to the dog. Hon. Members will recognise that we are dealing with the dog and its activities, rather than the person's activities. Hon. Members might be tempted to take that opportunity for sport of another form presented by a play on words, but I am sure that they will resist it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid that amendment No. 2 is not acceptable. Nevertheless, I am sympathetic to the idea that there should be some exclusions, especially for clearing up after working dogs. I am attracted to amendment No. 5 as it would enable the Secretary of State to prescribe exceptions by regulation. Of course, we would consider the views of the Committee when drafting such regulations. We would consult widely before bringing such regulations before the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that some concern has been expressed by the National Farmers Union. Some time ago, as a farmer's assistant, I shepherded using dogs, so I can imagine that the situation is extremely difficult. Before I left the Antipodes—I mention this cautiously after the interesting game on Sunday—my last task was driving approximately 5,000 to 7,000 sheep along a road using four or five dogs. Of course, roads can be designated under the Bill. The technique used in the Antipodes involves the use of a hunt-away dog, which the farmer, who is at the rear of the flock, sends ahead of the sheep to turn them. Often the dog is out of sight and both it and the farmer are working hard. So, obviously, the farmer's attention can be drawn away from that dog to his other dogs which work behind him. If they were my dogs, they would be behind me behaving themselves. The farmer would be unable to see whether the dog had utilised the opportunity to plant a dropping on the highway. As one can imagine, he would have his hands full
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0272">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
dealing with 7,000 sheep and a hunt-away dog, especially if it were in training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether that technique is used in this country, but I can understand why the NFU is especially concerned. I am sure that if there are any members of the farming community among us they could say whether a hunt-away dog system is used in this country. Nevertheless, we should recognise that a farmer using dogs to drive a large and potentially difficult flock or herd—whether it be of cattle or sheep, or the llamas and deer that have been mentioned—would face considerable problems. Therefore, amendment No. 5 is eminently suitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that basis, I hope that, after considering all the points made both for and against the amendment, and hon. Members will accept amendment No. 5, my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North will withdraw amendment No. 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Elletson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blackpool, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting and useful debate on this series of amendments. I am grateful to all hon. Members for contributing to it. The amendments deal with exemptions to the Bill—a matter which is perceived to be one of the fundamental difficulties with clause 1. I hope that it will not be necessary to take up much more of the Committee's time on the rest of the Bill because it has received a degree of cross-party support and widespread public support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I want to deal with the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham, and then with the other concerns that were raised, especially by the hon. Member for Burnley. They are valid concerns and I hope that we have now reached an acceptable compromise in amendment No. 5, which was tabled in my name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the amendment that would exempt people with hearing impairments, my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham made some valid points about the importance of dogs to such people. She underlined that there were 2,000 dogs for the deaf in this country, which is a statistic that interested and fascinated members of the Committee. We should take this opportunity to recognise the valuable service that those dogs provide and, indeed, the service provided by the dog trainers and the various charitable organisations involved in such training. She also said that it costs £2,500 to train each dog and referred to the various purposes for which they can be used. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving the Committee that valuable information. However, I do not think that my hon. Friend made her case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East (Mr. Ainsworth) dealt with the amendments—some hon. Members may think rather unkindly but, nevertheless, it was necessary to deal with them in that clear way. He described them as otiose, Which may have been rather unkind, but they are not necessary because they are dealt with in the clause relating to reasonableness. I do not believe that we need to exempt people with hearing
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
difficulties. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East thoroughly demolished the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham by suggesting that people realise that their dogs have defecated by means of their visual and nasal senses, rather than by their hearing ability. [	<i>Interruption</i>] My hon. Friend the Minister suggests that perhaps our physical senses are also alerted when we step in a dog's produce. Those are the important senses and there is no need to exempt deaf people, however much sympathy we have with their predicament and however much we recognise the valuable service provided by the trained dogs who make such a difference to the lives of deaf people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's amendment also referred to dogs that are
	<br><blockquote><p>"used to assist any person for whom there is a medical or therapeutic need for such assistance".</p></blockquote>
She referred to them as PAT—pets as therapy—dogs. That amendment is covered by the defence of "reasonable excuse", which clause 1 allows. I refer again to the Pet Advisory Committee, which said that medical or therapeutic need for an assistance dog would not necessarily corrolate to an incapacity to clear up after a dog.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no need for the amendment because the problem would be covered entirely by the defence of "reasonable excuse". My hon. Friend mentioned medical conditions, such as hernia and non specific back pain, and suggested that exemption should apply to certain medical conditions. Such matters are covered by the defence of "reasonable excuse" and there is no need for her to proceed with her amendments. Given that the defence of "reasonable excuse" would be the best way in which to deal with the problem, I respectfully suggest that she should withdraw the amendments. I shall await with interest to hear what she has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chesham and Amersham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to my hon. Friend and I shall consider not pressing my amendments to a Division. However, at this stage, I should like to keep my options open, especially as amendment No. 5 has been accepted for discussion by the Chair. I should be grateful if my hon. Friend could elaborate on amendment No. 5, so that my mind may be set at rest and some of the serious issues to which I have referred can be examined to see whether they fall within the ambit of amendment No. 5. There has been some misunderstanding about the number of hearing dogs for the deaf. My statistics show that there are only about 300 in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I shall deal with amendment No. 5 in a moment. I assure her that we shall consider the matters that she has raised and I am sure that the Minister will take them into account, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East touched on the nub of the issue at our previous sitting, when he suggested that we should consider whether specifying
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0273">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
exemptions would weaken the Bill. That argument was made also by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) who, unfortunately, is not present at the moment. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East asked us to consider whether the exemptions are necessary and suggested that they were covered by the defence of "reasonable excuse".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Sykes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Scarborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little worried about the extensive powers that we often give to Ministers. Does not my hon. Friend accept that we should consider the amendments more seriously? Far too many powers are given to Ministers and we often end up in situations for which we had not planned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That argument needs to be considered seriously and it is something that we must examine when we discuss amendment No. 5. I am sure that it is not the Minister's intention to take unto himself unnecessarily stringent and fierce powers. I believe that he understands that the amendments were tabled in order to suggest where there would be a legitimate reason to exempt certain dog owners. The amendment that we are now dealing with relates to working dogs, which is of particular concern to the farming community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham raised a legitimate point when she asked for it to be made crystal clear that there are particular categories of people with physical or sensory disabilities who may find it difficult to clear up after their dogs. I have no doubt that the Minister will take that into account, as will local authorities when they enforce such legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish was worried about the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East that the amendments might weaken the Bill. He pointed out that the Bill already allows exemptions on the defence of reasonable excuse and when permission is given by the landowner or the local authority. He suggested that those exemptions were adequate and that there was no need to extend them because that would open the floodgates to a range of exemptions which would weaken the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to working dogs, he also asked what a sporting purpose was. He suggested that such a definition might cover a man who let out his dog and had a bet on it. We all laughed about that and recognised that there might be some truth in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Burnley was equally concerned about the amendment on working dogs, particularly the first part of it, which mentions dogs used for sporting purposes. He was concerned that that might cover hunting and other field sports, thereby implying approval for such activities. I do not think that it would imply an such approval, it would simply exempt those activities—and many others, such as dog trials, shows and greyhound races—from the provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
Thomason) mentioned the problems of the concept of reasonableness, expressing his concern that such a definition would be unlikely to include dogs used for sporting purposes. That is one reason why it is important that we should make it clear that the Bill should not be used as a means of banning the use of dogs for sporting purposes, or any other the other activities that we have mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Southport (Mr. Banks) said that many of the problems associated with amendment Nos. 1 and 2 could be solved by regulations or orders. That is a crucial point and we are attempting to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Banks 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has fairly accurately reported the thrust of my remarks, but I hope that he will bear in mind my support for the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham. We should not allow regulations to be made by Ministers willy-nilly. As I understand it, the point of the Bill is to avoid confusion and doubt and to clear up some of the current difficulties. My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham was entirely right to table her probing amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough (Mr. Sykes), I do not want too many powers given to Ministers, because otherwise the light touch shown by my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North in introducing the Bill and steering it through Committee may be lost. The Minister shakes his head. No doubt he will be able to make his points later. My point is that it would not be right to leave too much to chance by giving the Minister too many powers to make up too many regulations. We should try to keep the measure simple and agree in Committee on the key points of the Bill. I hope that my hon. Friend will do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that he is making an intervention, not another speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. I am most grateful for your advice, but if you were to read the Official Report you would find that many of the previous sitting's interventions were considerably longer than the one that I have just made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not making a judgment on other Members' interventions last Wednesday; I am making a judgment on the hon. Gentleman's intervention this Wednesday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with my hon. Friend's uncharacteristically lengthy intervention. Conservative members of the Committee noticed the brevity with which he addressed the Committee during its previous sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend was right to point out that we took note of and agreed with the substance of the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham. Equally, he was right to say that one of the most effective
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0274">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
ways in which to deal with some of the concerns expressed in Committee would be by way of an order. However, I accept what he said about not transferring unnecessary powers to the Minister, and I am sure that it is not the Minister's intention to acquire such unnecessary powers. Indeed, the Minister has suggested to me privately that the sort of powers that he would need would be best achieved by—as he described it—a light All Black touch. I am sure that we would recognise that as one of the Minister's characteristics, and one which he would want to pass on to his successors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Surrey, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As one who served under my hon. Friend the Minister on Wandsworth council, I am familiar with the light touch that he is capable of exercising when he chooses to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I invite the hon. Member for Blackpool, North to continue after that useful intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his useful intervention, as you described it, Mr. Hill.

Amendment No. 5, which stands in my name, proposes that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be a defence to a prosecution for an offence under this section to show that, at the time of the defecation, the dog was being used for a purpose specified in an order made by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
I emphasise that that word is "order", not "ordure". I should attempt to allay my hon. Friend's concern about unnecessary powers being acquired by the Minister by making it quite clear that the regulations that we are discussing—which would be made under powers given by amendment No. 5—would be subject to the negative resolution procedure. That would enable Parliament to review the power, and it would provide a check on Ministers. This is a sensible way in which to deal with the concerns expressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomason</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this an intervention? If so, I hope that it will be brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is, and I shall be brief. Is the purport of my hon. Friend's remarks that he intends to withdraw amendment No. 2 and proceed only with amendment No. 5, or does he propose that amendment No. 5 be incorporated into amendment No. 2 as an additional sub-paragraph?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his question. I shall clarify the position for his benefit and for the benefit of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I propose to withdraw amendment No. 1, which would have the effect of letting fall amendment No. 2, which is dependent on it. It would also let fall the amendments in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
Amersham, amendments (a) and (b) and Nos. 3 and 4. I shall then move amendment No. 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the most effective method of dealing with the Committee's concerns, without having to set out a specific definition of particular exemptions, which members of the Committee rightly identified as being unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The final comments of the hon. Member for Bradford, North in response to his hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove clarified the situation. I was going to ask whether he intended to press amendment No. 1 to a vote and then move formally amendment No. 2. It has been shown during last week's debate and today that, although Committee members support the main purpose of the substantive amendment No. 2, it is flawed, as my manuscript amendment was flawed, and is not the perfect way to achieve its objective. So I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has said that he no longer intends to press that amendment to the vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Surrey, East (Mr. Ainsworth) referred to the Minister's former life as leader of Wandsworth council. As a council tax payer whose London home is in Wandsworth, I must say that Wandsworth council certainly has not solved the problem of dog fouling on footpaths, which is appalling. That shows just how difficult the problem is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East Was talking about a light touch. If he had the benefit of being a resident in the London borough of Wandsworth, he would have recognised that it is impossible to have a lighter touch than two years' zero community charge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We could have a debate about that but I am sure that you would, quite rightly, rule us out of order, Mr. Hill. I have never agreed with the politics of Wandsworth council. However, dog fouling is a problem in Wandsworth, as it is in my constituency, where I was involved with the council, so I do not pretend to have achieved any greater success in solving the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way that things are going, amendment No. 5, will be the only amendment to be moved formally. I am not fond of legislation or amendments that give powers to Secretaries of State, so I shall not support amendment No. 5. It is sometimes argued that Secretaries of State are reasonable people. They might be reasonable before they become Secretaries of State but then they often change. Parliament should keep powers to itself, not give powers to Ministers. I would be only slightly more amenable to giving powers to Labour Secretaries of State. I believe in the principle that we should not give out such powers. I realise that the Minister spoke on the amendment in the constructive spirit of our debates, but I still think it is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Blackpool, North referred to the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish. He was right to say that the hon. Member for Blackpool North had got it right in the original draft.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0275">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
Subsections (1) (a) and (b) provide for the two defences that I believe are sensible. I do not see any need to give the Secretary of State additional power. I have no doubt that if a dog defecates and a policeman is on duty, the policeman's action will be found to be reasonable within the interpretation of the original drafting of the Bill. I understand why the hon. Member for Blackpool, North has tabled amendment No 5 and I believe that he has done so in an open spirit having taken note of what was said during last week's debate, but having considered the arguments, I believe that the Bill provides adequate exemption and protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and I are speaking the same language, I shall vote against the amendment. It would be stupid to prosecute a shepherd who was moving his sheep along a road. Members of the Committee are basically saying the same thing, but I do not believe that amendment No. 5 is necessary. The Bill is best left as it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I tabled my amendments so that the problems of the elderly or disabled could be discussed. I am satisfied that we have done justice to the spirit of the probing amendment. I appreciate that if my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North were to withdraw his amendment, my amendments would also fall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased by my hon. Friend's comments on amendment No. 5, which was sensibly grouped with the other amendments. It is clear from this morning's discussion that amendment No. 5 has been tabled the spirit in which I tabled my amendments. My concern is to ensure that, in the light of the decision in Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart, the problems that the elderly, disabled or sick face when their dogs defecate are recorded in 	<i>Hansard.</i> I do not see any reason for grading disabilities so I have referred to those with disabilities, more generally in my amendment. Hearing dogs and assistance dogs help people who may not be 100 per cent. disabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a member of the Committee, I have been sent some amazing material. Assistance Dogs (UK) recently came to my attention. It was established recently to promote the interests of disabled people with dogs that have been trained by registered charities, including Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, Hearing Dogs for the Deaf, Dogs for the Disabled and Support Dogs. Assistance Dogs (UK) aims to help people who depend on dogs for mobility and independence to, for example, visit supermarkets, food shops and other public facilities. It obtained from the Department of Health an agreement to give assistance dogs access to establishments where food is on sale. Until recently, such access was restricted to guide dogs for the blind. The Department of Health accepts that the derogations must be widened to include other dogs, such as hearing dogs or support dogs. I am grateful to Assistance Dogs UK for bringing those points to my attention, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and my hon. Friend the Minister will appreciate them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many devices on the market that can help the elderly, those with arthritis and, perhaps, those with a
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
problem with balance, I have brought one device into the Committee. Some of them are difficult to manipulate because they require intricate movements of the fingers. Those who are unable to do make those movement would have a reasonable excuse for not clearing up after their dogs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the removal of faeces, a person need not necessarily have a device that is similar to the one that my hon. Friend has with her. If a person has severe arthritis, that is excuse enough not to remove it. We should not deny an elderly person with arthritis the opportunity and enjoyment of having a pet, but even if a person is over the age of 65, he or she could remove the defecation by using a black bag or something similar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention and I agree with him, but there may be people who are exceptions to the rule because they cannot manipulate such a device. I want to ensure that they do not live in fear of legislation placed on the statute book by this Committee. Many devices exist. My amendment No. 6 has been selected for debate and perhaps I shall be able to expand my point properly when we discuss it, rather than being ruled out of order now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that point, will my hon. Friend confirm that the device to which she has referred is a pooper-scooper which is mentioned in the Bill, the reference to which amendment No. 6 seeks to delete?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Actually, the device is called Easi-scoop. It is made by Pedigree under the Exelpet trademark. It is not called a pooper-scooper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the assurances that I have sought are given to me by the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North, I shall not press my amendments (a) and (b) and amendments Nos. 3 and 4. But I shall do so only on the understanding that the fears that I have raised on behalf of many dog owners throughout the United Kingdom are firmly taken on board when the law is interpreted by the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to detain the Committee again on this group of amendments, but I want to say a word or two about amendment No. 5 which has been tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North. I agree with the hon. Member for Burnley. I believe that the clause and the Bill are fine as they stand. I failed to follow my hon. Friend's logic when he explained the thinking behind amendment No. 5. He implied that it would replace the other amendments that he had tabled, thereby also replacing the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham. I do not understand how it would do that. The amendments that we discussed at length last week created specific exemptions, and discussed the merits or drawbacks of doing that and the problems that they could create.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, amendment No. 5, which creates an exemption on the grounds that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0276">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"the dog was being used for a purpose specified in an order made by the Secretary of State",</p></blockquote>
does not deal satisfactorily with the issues raised in the other amendments. I see no relationship between them. Will my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North describe in more detail what he envisaged amendment No. 5 achieving? Why does he think that it is needed, and what exemptions does the Minister or my hon. Friend have in mind? The last thing that we would want to see—I am sure the Secretary of State would agree—is a plethora of orders being made to cover every possible eventuality which might arise under this provision. The matter is unclear and I doubt whether my hon. Friend or the Minister will be able to make it clear. I have a profound sense of unease about amendment No. 5 and share the view of the hon. Member for Burnley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing in the amendments adds to or improves in any way the "reasonable excuse" provision in the Bill. The more we discuss the matter, the more firmly I become convinced that the Bill should remain as drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak this morning either. I apologise for not being present last week because this is an important Bill. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East will accept amendment No. 5 because it would provide flexibility. Some of the suggested exclusions have been too rigid. There may be other exemptions that should be included and there is a danger that when the Bill becomes law people may find that they are falling foul of it because we have not considered their circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 5 would provide the Minister with the flexibility to consider the matter time and again. If people give examples to the Minister or to their Members of Parliament showing that the legislation is too prescriptive, representations can be made to the Minister and he may then be able to alter it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sykes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised to hear my hon. Friend's comment. He will recall that two years ago we shared interesting times in this Committee Room discussing the Deregulation and Contracting Out Bill when reservations were expressed week in, week out, month in, month out on the powers that were being handed over to Ministers to implement legislation. Many examples were given of the effects of that further down the line. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that we pass too many powers to Ministers and to Brussels?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly agree with the latter point. We probably pass too much legislation. I am a great believer in trying to reduce the amount of legislation and removing laws that may have passed their sell-by date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember sitting on the Standing Committee which considered the Deregulation and Contracting Out Bill with my hon. Friend. I am keen to ensure that we do not make the Bill so prescriptive and include so many bits and pieces that even the enforcement officers are unsure of what is within the spirit of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
We want to give flexibility to the Minister, but we do not want the clipboard mentality to creep in and enforcement officers to interpret the provisions so strictly that they start to pick on people unfairly. We want compassion and understanding to be shown. The last thing we was is to frighten people, especially the elderly, into believing that they cannot take a dog on to the streets in case it defecates and they are unable to clean up the mess.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is making a good case for omitting amendment No. 5 and leaving the "reasonable excuse" provision to deal with the problems that he envisages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem with "reasonable excuse" is that it is open to too wide an interpretation. I want the clipboard mentality to be put to one side. In too many cases the securitate of the town hall parade around the place interpretating legislation far too rigidly and without common sense—something that is lost on too many enforcement officers these days. Common sense should be used in interpreting and enforcing the legislation. I hope that my hon. Friend will take on board my remarks. Although the legislation should not be too open-endedly reasonable, we should ensure that the Secretary of State will have an opportunity to decide whether an excuse is reasonable. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment and, I am sure, all future Ministers while we remain in Government, will be able to use their judgment to make sensible changes by means of orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not possible that if we accept amendment No. 5, the matter could go to court at a later date? The Bill's two principle exemptions from prosecution are, at present, clearly worded. However, they could be affected if the courts say, "The Minister has issued orders. Those exemptions no longer apply." That could defeat the purpose of the original provision. It would be better to leave the Bill as it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that point. I should hope that the courts would take into account the spirit of the Bill when considering any orders that the Minister may introduce. The Bill was introduced for a good reason; none of us enjoys the fact that when we walk the streets of our constituencies, we see dog dirt lying in the pavement where children walk. It makes no difference whether one's constituency is in the north, south, east or west of England, or whether it is in Wales or Scotland; all parts of the country have the same problem. I receive letters from my constituents complaining about the situation and wishing that the local authority would take action. It is in that spirit that the legislation was introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to what my hon. Friends the Members for Surrey, East and for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) have said. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley that the amendment would provide additional flexibility. In general, when the House has legislated on a raft of issues, Government Departments have found it helpful to have the opportunity subsequently to issue regulations when appropriate. If the amendment were rejected, that flexibility might be lost. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0277">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
noticed that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment nodded his agreement as I made that point. That does not surprise me. I have no doubt that he shares the view of Ministers in other Departments. Ministers like to have flexibility to change things from time to time as they see fit. That is one side of the argument. However, I also listened carefully to the remarks of the hon. Member for Burnley and my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough. All members of the Committee know that my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough prefers deregulation to over-regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred earlier to the importance of a light touch. On balance, the light touch that my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North has shown so far should be maintained and, therefore, the amendment should be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that there is a world of difference between a light touch and a soft touch? A light touch suggests a willingness to understand some excuses for not clearing away dog dirt. A soft touch would apply to totally unreasonable people who have no intention of clearing away their dog dirt because they do not regard it as their responsibility, but that of the local authority or someone else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point, which relates to the thrust of the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North is trying to clamp down on irresponsible dog owners. The fixed-penalty scheme that we debated earlier is the right approach and I hope that it will have an effect on those dog owners who—if I may say so—need to be brought to heel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 5 seems to give powers to the Secretary of State to create loopholes in the Bill as and when he chooses. My hon. Friend will know that the Bill is not uncontentious. The hon. Member for Burnley and my hon. Friend the Minister have spoken of the public opposition that byelaws have encountered. It is easy to envisage a large campaign of opposition against the provisions of the Bill by people who represent the dog-owning classes. In such circumstances, if the amendment is agreed to, a weak Secretary of State could make an order that taking a dog for a walk or exercising a dog will represent an exemption from the terms of the Bill. I believe that the amendment would potentially create a dangerous loophole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who refers to the dog-owning classes. I had thought that dog owning was classless, but I accept the general thrust of his remark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Burnley knows that the difficulties of byelaws because, without the difficulties in Burnley borough council, he might not have become leader of the Labour group there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sykes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we get into discussions about the dogless society, I hope that my hon. Friend will turn his mind to the idea that most dog owners are perfectly
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
reasonable; they have been properly brought up and know exactly what to do when they see their dogs committing an offence. I am thinking rather about the young lout who struts down the street with his pit bull terrier; he is the most likely to ignore the misdemeanours of his animal. Will my hon. Friend say how the Bill will deal with such a person?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his remarks. I do not want to pursue a matter that is not in order, but I should say to my hon. Friend, who I know is genuinely concerned about the point that he made, that the amendment would give the Department of the Environment and our hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State the flexibility to introduce when appropriate—if it is not appropriate, I hope that he will take no action—a regulation to deal with my hon. Friend's concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the remarks that I was making a moment ago, my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley referred to the need for flexibility. I made it clear that the less the Committee mucked about with the Bill promoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North, the better. I hope, Mr. Hill, that the phrase "muck about" is in order; perhaps I should say tinker with the Bill. I have some sympathy with the flexibility argument, but it is important that the Committee takes account of what my hon. Friend wants to do, as it is his Bill. I have an open mind and I hope that he will make his views clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw my remarks to a conclusion with a final point. My hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley referred to the importance of not being too prescriptive. I agree that that is important. I could spend some time debating the significance of my hon. Friend's remarks, but I shall steer clear from doing so. If we keep the Bill simple, it will be more effective when it is enacted. I look to my hon. Friend for his guidance and advice and hope that the Committee will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to all my hon. Friends who have spoken to amendment No. 5. Before discussing the concerns that they have properly expressed, I shall try to reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham. Her anxieties have been listened to and considered and I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister agrees. She has quite properly raised issues of genuine concern about people who have difficulties because of sensory impairment or physical incapacity. It is not the Bill's intention to place them in unnecessary or undue difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I express my great thanks for the way in which my hon. Friend has listened to my arguments? I assure him that he has put my mind at rest, as well as the minds of the many dog owners in the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for doggedly—someone had to say it—pursuing her amendments. She has done so with great grace and skill and we have all listened to her anxieties, which will be reflected in the interpretation of clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to amendment No. 5. We are all aware that my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East is a great
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0278">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
champion of individual liberty. He expressed his concern about the amendment against that background. However, he is over-egging the pudding and making too much of the amendment by suggesting that draconian powers will be given to my hon. Friend the Minister, who is virtually being portrayed as some sort of jack-booted thug, with a bullwhip in his hand, who will charge down every high street persecuting the nation's 7 million dog owners. I am sure that he will see that that is not my hon. Friend the Minister's intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mistakes what I said; I shall be accused of being unkind again—I am beginning to feel sensitive about it. What worries me is that far from behaving in an anti-social way, my hon. Friend the Minister will be under pressure from lobby groups and may use his order-making power to exempt certain activities that are covered by the Bill.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware of the concerns expressed by my hon. Friend, but he should consider the problem from the other point of view. Genuine worries have been expressed by organisations such as the NFU—an organisation with many members in my hon. Friend's constituency and the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NFU raises a specific question—it is one of the reasons why the Minister should have the flexibility to deal with the matter. I have received a letter from the NFU which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is however one technical point on which we would wish to see the Bill amended. There is the case of common land"—</p></blockquote>
a matter to which I referred at the previous sitting—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to which the public have a lawful right of access. … there are some commons which are used for grazing purposes and where the public does have a lawful right of access and which could therefore be designated. In this situation sheep farmers who are commoners would not be able to waive the poo-scoop offence, because persons with rights of common are not owners, they are not occupiers, and they do not have control of the land. To overcome this technical problem, we would favour the Bill being amended to exempt working dogs from its provisions."</p></blockquote>
The NFU rightly observed that doubts could be expressed as to whether the reasonableness clause provided the sort of exemption that it sought. We should specifically say that working dogs should not be subject to the Bill's
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
provisions. The most effective way to achieve that is by allowing my hon. Friend the Minister to make an order. However, rather than being accused of using undue authoritarian power, my hon. Friend might prefer local authorities to use the legislation in an authoritarian way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 2 seeks to exempt members of Her Majesty's armed forces and police officers. Since the end of the second world war and certainly since 1979, extreme left-wing authorities have targeted the police and the armed forces. We do not want to return to such days. We do not want local authorities turning on the police or the Army again and seeking to use little bits of legislation to make life more difficult for them. What better way for authorities to achieve that than to insist that, in going about their lawful business, police officers should, as I suggested before, have to worry about using pooper-scoopers to pick up their dogs' faeces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clearly not the intention of the Bill to allow local authorities to act in such a way. The best way to ensure that that cannot happen is to allow the Minister to specify particular exemptions by order. I ask my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East to give the Minister the flexibility suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley, who said that the amendment would ensure that the securitate did not get its way and that specific exemptions could be made of the sort that we have discussed today. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 1, line 31 leave out 'pooper-scooper or other' and insert 'device for or'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said to you, Mr. Hill, and to my hon. Friends at our previous sitting that I was not happy with the term "pooper-scooper". I consulted the House of Commons Library about it and I also considered whether that part of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0279">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
the clause should be removed. I came up with the word "device" because it would add to the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"other suitable means of removing the faeces"</p></blockquote>
and it would take nothing from the spirit of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "pooper-scooper" is not referred to or defined elsewhere in the Bill. We are all familiar with the term. I sought guidance from the "Oxford English Dictionary". I am old-fashioned enough to remember when the word "poop" referred to part of a sailing ship. The poop of a ship or the breaking of a wave over the stern of a vessel are the origins of the word "poop". It means other things, too. For example, it can mean to break down, to stop working or to conk out. We all know the term "I am pooped". It also means to make a short blast of sound with a horn or to blow or toot, to gulp in drinking and to break wind or to defecate but, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, that is slang.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "pooper-scooper", which is slang, has been used in many examples of literature. Indeed, in 1976, it was stated in 	<i>Maclean's Magazine</i> that
	<br><blockquote><p>"a man on a motor-cycle with a pooper-scooper would be dispatched to clean it up."</p></blockquote>
In 1978, the term was used in 	<i>The Daily Telegraph,</i> in which it was stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It may soon be common to see people holding a dog lead in one hand and a "poop-scoop" in the other".</p></blockquote>
As the term "pooper-scooper" is slang, it should not be included in a piece of legislation that could go into the statute book for immortality. At present, pooper-scooper is not a trade name, but there is no reason why a company could not adopt the term an market a device under that name. That would give an advantage to the company because the term would be enshrined in legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have declared an interest; I own a dog. But I should like to say that I am not retained in any way by any dog food company or pet company. Therefore, I think that I can talk about a range of devices produced by a dog food companies and pet accessory companies, such as Spillers, Hartz and Pedigree. There are two sorts of device. The most common is a plastic or wire-frame scooping device with a bag. Using such devices takes a bit of practice, hence the amendments that I have tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Pedigree Excelpet Easi-Scoop, which I exhibited earlier, costs about £1.99 and has a plastic drawer and comes with 20 bags. Similar devices are available, including the heavier, larger Scoop-it device which costs between £1.95 and £2.50. A very expensive version, called the Pick Up Dog Toilet, is also available. It comes with 30 bags and costs about £3.98. For larger dogs, there is a larger device, costing £6.22. The Danish device has a lock and smaller bags, which allow faeces to be wrapped up and put in a pocket without too many shudders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
As I said earlier, bending down is impossible for some elderly people. The GardenKeeper—an expensive device costing £14.99—is an arm's length pole with three attachable heads which helps people to collect faeces at a distance. By no stretching of the imagination could that be call a pooper-scooper, although it could be called a pooper-pole scooper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Dispoz-A-Scoop, which has no pole, costs 39p. There are scoops that use cardboard instead of plastic or metal. Spillers has sponsored something called Ben's Scoops, which are plastic bags with a cardboard scoop attached Hatz produces a pooper-scooper, costing £2.49. That is almost the full range of available devices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the companies have faced a problem; the devices have not sold. The manufacturers say that dog owners have yet to accept their social responsibility. I hope that one of the side effects of the Bill will be that more companies will produce devices to help dog owners. We would all look forward to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to my original objection. "Pooper-scooper" is a slang word, which does not include the full range of available devices. Indeed, I could go further and mention the old shovel and bag system, paper bags and small vacuum cleaners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish made a brief appearance but has now left the hon. Member for Burnley in splendid isolation on the Opposition Benches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish had to attend a Committee before he came here and he has to attend another Committee at 12 o'clock. That is the only reason why he is not with us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for clarifying that point. The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish is obviously a busy man, but it is a shame that he is not here. When I questioned him last week about the motos crottes, he seemed to have no knowledge of the device. I am surprised that anyone who serves on a Committee that deals specifically with dogs' fouling should not know about that device, especially as the Parisian motos crottes scheme has been operating for several years, as I said when I referred to vacuum cleaners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paris has a tremendous problem with dogs. There are 200,000 dogs in Paris alone, and there are many more dogs in France than there are in Britain—10.5 million as opposed to 7 million. In 1992, it was estimated that 10 tonnes of dog dirt was dumped daily on the Paris pavements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sykes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely interested in what my hon. Friend says. In April, my hon. Friends the Members for Blackpool, North and for Surrey, East and I went with our families to EuroDisney near Paris. We found ourselves in the same situation as the French, and our children had to avoid dog dirt outside the hotel every day. Paris is now the most filthy city and has changed for the worse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0280">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
confirming what I already knew. I have experienced what he describes myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the motos crottes are making a great deal of difference. The scheme costs Paris about 43 million French francs a year, which is about £4 million. When Jacques Chirac, whom we all now know as the President of France, was mayor of Paris, he introduced tough fines of up to 1,300 French francs—which is about £60 to £130, give or take a "p" or two—for owners who allowed their dogs to foul. That was accompanied by a poster campaign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pooper-scooters—the motos crottes—are adapted motorbikes with vacuums. They are produced in Paris by the same company that produces public superloos. That company pioneered the use of the vacuum. The machines freeze the offending articles on the pavement and such them up. I do not believe that the term "pooper-scooper" covers a vacuum cleaner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not just Paris that is far-sighted enough to produce pooper-scooters with vacuums. It may come as a surprise to the hon. Member for Burnley, who is sitting in isolation on the Opposition Benches, to know that I found an article dated August 1990 that described how the London borough of Lewisham has set up a pooper-scooter scheme. The pooper-scooter cruised the pavements in search of incidents, as they are known in the trade. The borough accompanied the scheme with a poster campaign and set up a hot line and incident room. The pooper-scooter hot line for Deptford town hall enabled residents to register complaints and promised a same-day visit from the pooper-scooter. That was a scientific way in which to deal with the problem. I could go on at length about it, but it, too, involved a freeze-dried vacuum method, which the term "pooper-scooper" does not cover.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should be grateful to my hon. Friend for tabling the amendment. Does she agree, however, that the various devices to which she has referred would be included under the words in the Bill:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or other suitable means of removing"?</p></blockquote>
Is the core of her objection that "pooper-scooper" is not proper language to use in the Bill? Will she say whether any devices are marketed specifically under that name in which case there would be a danger that the Bill might refer to a brand name?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend was not paying attention during my opening remarks. I shall refresh his memory. I said that the term is not referred to or defined elsewhere in the Bill. It is not currently a trade name, although it is very similar to some existing trade names. I fear that someone might manufacture such a product and give it that trade name following its authentication by its appearance on the face of British legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend know—perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North might be able to tell us—whether the phrase "pooper-
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
scooper" appears in the "Oxford English Dictionary"? Is she aware that the advisory committee set up under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 used the term "poop-scoop", rather than pooper-scooper? There seems to be a lack of clarity as to which of those undesirable terms should be used. I support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend, although again I feel that proper attention was not paid to my earlier remarks, during which I referred to the "Oxford English Dictionary", which identifies those terms as children's slang. Using slang in legislation is to be deprecated. "Poop-scoop" is also a possible term. Why should we put "er" on the end to create the diminutive or mignon term 'pooper-scooper". That is why I want to remove it completely from the Bill. No definition is given. We should use an all-encompassing word, which is a good word in the English language—the word "device".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said earlier that I had considered doing no more than remove the word "pooper-scooper", but I decided to insert the word "device" because it implies something mechanical. Many of the objects used to remove dogs' faeces are of a mechanical nature or of a more advanced technology, such as the freeze-dried vacuum method.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sykes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the word "pooper-scooper" borrowed from the Americans? In that case, should it not be returned to them as soon as possible?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are many things which should be returned to the Americans as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Please will hon. Members speak through the Chair. A little comic section is developing. It is far better for remarks to be addressed through the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Hill, I take your advice and am grateful for it. I cannot help the fact that some of my colleagues have schoolboy humour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has chosen the word "device". She has told us at some length about the various mechanical devices used in France and elsewhere for the purposes about which we are talking. However, the word "implement" might be equally suitable. There is not much wrong with using a trowel and a polythene bag, but they do not qualify as a device.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not a helpful intervention. I know that my hon. Friend is supporting the amendment wholeheartedly, but he failed to hear my earlier mention of the shovel and bag method, which comes within the definition of another
	<br><blockquote><p>"suitable means of removing the faeces".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would give us a fully encompassing phrase which would cover the mechanical, the simple and the technologically advanced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When looking up words in the dictionary one occasionally comes across other meanings for them. I had quite forgotten that the word "poop" also meant:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0281">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"a stupid or ineffectual person; a fool or a bore".</p></blockquote>
I do not want to be accused of being any of those things, so I shall conclude by asking my hon. Friends to support the amendment. The spirit of good English is encompassed throughout our legislation. We cannot afford to let our standards slip and allow such an offensive term on to the statute book. I want to press my amendment to a vote and to remove the term "pooper-scooper" from the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure you, Mr. Hill, that I shall be brief in speaking to amendment No. 6. Also, I assure the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham that I was present throughout her speech and heard every word she said. The hon. Lady approached me earlier today and asked whether I would support her amendment; at that stage I said that I would not. However, having listened to her speech, she has convinced me that the Bill would be improved by the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his support. He knows the spirit in which I tabled it and I am pleased that he acknowledges that the force of my argument has won the day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Lady for her remarks, but I must say that I shall support the Bill, whether or not the amendment is made. I hope that we do not choose to have an unnecessarily lengthy debate on the amendment, because there are better things that we could be doing than discussing whether the term "pooper-scooper" should be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I think that the hon. Lady made the case for changing the wording to "device". It is right to do so. I can see that someone could easily change the name of their product to pooper-scooper and use the legislation to promote it. It is perhaps wrong to incorporate slang into legislation, but I am sure that if in 100 years time, the "Antiques Roadshow" were to show a gold implement—or "device" as we shall now call it—that was used for scooping up after the royal corgis, the programme's presenters would still call it a pooper-scooper, whatever we decide today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the sake of brevity I am prepared to vote for the amendment, but I support the Bill as drafted and I hope that we do not have too long a debate on this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham considers that she has won the argument. Although my earlier intervention was sceptical, I tend to agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I only indicated that I had won the argument with the hon. Member for Burnley. I would not presume that I had persuaded the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, because that reduces my speech on the amendment by half.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend referred to the Lewisham solution and the freeze-dried approach. She referred to the question of
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
pooper poles. She referred to the English language—very eloquently, if I may say so. We are discussing an important subject but we can deal with it briefly. It is important because, as my hon. Friend made the Committee aware—some of us were listening intently—the fact is that my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North will undoubtedly be remembered for this Bill in years to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On balance, my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham has not only won the argument with the hon. Member for Burnley, but with the whole Committee—at least I see no dissent on this side. I am grateful to her for putting forward a number of probing amendments and for working extremely hard in the Committee. It would be a pity if some of the suggestions that she has rightly advanced in our debates did not become part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not like the term "pooper-scooper"—it is regarded with far too much frivolity and the Bill would be better off without it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am probably the last member of the Committee who should talk about the nature and usage of the English language, but I probably have a better understanding of slang that the other members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand why my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North used the word "pooper-scooper", and I am sure that the hon. Member for Burnley is right to say that the royal corgis' pooper-scoopers will be known in future as pooper-scoopers—whether they are made of plastic or gold—if only because the hon. Gentleman made the suggestion. The "Oxford English Dictionary" accepts that the word is well known, and I am sure that in time, it will become less of a slang word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could not we use either the word "poop-scoop" or the word "pooper-scooper"? Is not the latter phrase a diminutive of the former, which was the original slang word?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I dare not disagree with my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate why my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North wanted to include the word in the Bill, but the crunch argument was given by the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham, who said that it is an Americanism, which provides immediate support for her amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon.

We are grateful to her for her research into the issue. She regaled us with a great tide of information about contraptions, devices and pooper-scoopers, including the Scoop-it device and the Pedigree Exelpet, and she described the motos crottes system in France.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should make it clear that I have been admirably supported in my research by the House of Commons Library, which should not go unacknowledged for the help that it has given to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take seriously my hon. Friend's point about the use of slang in the English language and in parliamentary documents; it is a matter about which we should be more concerned. We should also be more concerned about our use of the English language. This is an appropriate moment at which to welcome my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley, who is a native of Wales, but who represents one of the finest and most attractive constituencies in Lancashire. My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham spoke about careless and ungrammatical language. I am conscious of the fact that I may have split an infinitive earlier. If I did so, I must apologise, and I hope that the 	<i>Official Report</i> will have rectified the matter. My hon. Friend makes a serious point; we should not use slang words in parliamentary documents, and I agree that "pooper-scooper" is a particularly repugnant Americanism. However, I am not sure about the use of the word "device". "The Book of Common Prayer" advises us not to follow
	<br><blockquote><p>"too much the devices and desires or our own hearts."</p></blockquote>
That is the only use of the word "devices" that I can call to mind; I do not think that, in the present context, we are using the word in the same way. I suspect that we are unclear about the precise meaning of the word. My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham suggests that it means something mechanical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I right in thinking that, in that context, "device" is meant to be "invention"? According to "The Book of Common Prayer", it could be an invention of the mind; according to the amendment, it could be an invention of a mechanical nature.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He is right that "device" is difficult to define. My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham suggested that it is something mechanical; my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove that it is an invention; and my hon. Friend for Surrey, East has told us that a trowel and a polythene bag is not a device. None the less, I recognise that my hon. Friends have made serious points. Despite my reservations about the use of the word device and the need for clarity, I thoroughly prefer it to the word "pooper-scooper".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I did not make it clear to my hon. Friend. The "Oxford English Dictionary", which includes the term, does not limit its definition to a specific design. However, it says that a pooper-scooper is
	<br><blockquote><p>"a device used to remove dogs' excrement from public areas".</p></blockquote>
Although the Library searched in thesauruses and
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
dictionaries of synonyms, it could not find another word for the slang word "pooper-scooper". In the absence of a suitable alternative, I chose to use the definition in the "Oxford English Dictionary".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sykes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Hill, for getting my name right. I recall a dreadful moment during a sitting of Standing Committee A when you referred to me as Mr. Dykes. That was unfortunate as my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East (Mr. Dykes) and I were expressing entirely different views on a subject close to our hearts, and it was important to clear up that misunderstanding. I have also been mistaken for Eric Sykes and, from time to time, even Bill Sykes. John Sykes will do nicely for the purpose of our discussions this morning.

My constituency fits the Bill perfectly. This year marks the 700th anniversary of Scarborough returning a Member of Parliament to Westminster—not the same one but sometimes it seems like it. I should like to share with the Committee the fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North is going to walk from my constituency to his during the summer recess. He will be starting in heaven and ending in Blackpool. I hope that the Bill clears the way for his perambulations. I hope to join him for at least five minutes at the start of his journey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituency enjoys 45 miles of beautiful, craggy coastline. There are many little villages nestling into the coast and beautiful, clean beaches. Many people come to visit those beaches every year. They enjoy walking on them and walking their dogs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The North Yorkshire moors are also in my constituency. Many people come on walking holidays—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is not making his maiden speech. We are discussing dogs fouling land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sykes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to paint a picture for the Committee and especially for you, Mr. Hill, who have yet to visit my constituency, so that you understand the

	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
importance of clean beaches, seas and feet to tourism, which is an important part of our economy. We have 300,000 visitors every year and a swollen population in summer. We have a wonderful foreshore in Scarborough and Whitby to which thousands of people come every week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend said that more than 300,000 people visit Scarborough every year. Do not many of those people come to Scarborough because they can take their dogs with them? If they go to the European mainland they would have difficulty bringing their dogs back because of quarantine. Scarborough is a suitable destination for holiday-makers who want to take their pet or assistance dogs with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sykes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting intervention. If I took my hon. Friend to Scarborough and Whitby, she would be amazed at the different languages she would hear on the foreshore—for example, Glaswegian, French, American. We have many visitors who cannot bring their dogs on holiday to my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point was that people who live in the United Kingdom cannot take their dogs to foreign parts such as mainland Europe without running foul of our quarantine laws, so one of the natural destinations within the United Kingdom, if they want to take their pets with them, is Scarborough. I was trying to encourage pet owners and people who use assistance dogs to visit my hon. Friend's constituency for their holidays.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sykes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for her words of encouragement. I am sure that millions of people are waiting to read her words and book their holidays in Scarborough rather than Blackpool.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scarborough also has a large retired population. Approximately 30 per cent. of those who live in Scarborough have retired there. I was interested in the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham to exempt people aged 65 and over. Many elderly people in my constituency are the sort who would want to clear up after their dogs have defecated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a lot of manufacturing in Scarborough and Whitby, and many young families. My family lives in Scarborough in a village called Scalby and my kids often run out to play. Perhaps you have children, Mr. Hill, who, when they were young, dashed out without bothering to look where they were treading. As a child, I was always in trouble with my mother, who had the patience of a saint—some people say that she still has.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Committee's attention to the absence of the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) on two occasions. The Liberal party's foundations are built on the practice of pavement politics—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey contacted me to say that he could not attend again. He made a splendid apology.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sykes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Hill, because it is right that that should be on the record. The point remains that the Liberal Democrats are practitioners of pavement politics and the Bill is about pavements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will be surprised to hear that a large slice of Yorkshire is owned by the Duchy of Lancaster, which is a source of great pleasure to my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and a source of great aggravation to me. The village of Goatland nestles in the heart of the North Yorkshire moors where there is plenty of common land with sheep roaming and flocks which are attended. I was interested to hear from my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East about common land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of my constituency is covered by a national park. I am happy to give way to my hon. Friend the Minister if he is able to assure me that the proposed changes for the national parks will not have an adverse effect on the ability of the authorities to carry out their duties imposed by the Environment Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give my hon. Friend that assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sykes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was also interested to read the exemptions proposed by my hon. friend the Member for Blackpool, North because they reminded me that I have a dog at home called Mack. He is fat, very affectionate and his bark is worse than his bite, which goes to prove that owners and dogs become more alike every day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not want my hon. Friend to mislead the Committee. His dog does not have a bark. When we tried to get into my hon. Friend's home at 1.30 in the morning, the dog was nowhere to be seen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sykes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An embarrassing intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We must return to clause 1. Although it is very interesting to hear about hon. Members' doggies, we must make some progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sykes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must remain in order, although it is important to be able to relate one's experience directly to legislation. As a manufacturer, I do that with relevant legislation as the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994. I always try to relate legislation that I am expected to agree to on behalf of my constituents to my experiences in life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should have walked my dog more often—although I do not get the opportunity to do so because I am here—but I decided that so long as he did not bite a constituent, I would take him to a surgery. Having put the lead on the dog and having dressed up to go to Scarborough for my surgery, I proceeded down the pedestrian precinct, felt a dragging on the lead and realised to my horror that my faithful friend was about to embarrass me in front of my constituents. The dog did embarrass me, thereby undoing months of careful preparation. I had to go to the Conservative office to find a means of clearing up his mess.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0284">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
I am relating that experience because, as a Member of Parliament, I had to clean up the mess, although I would have done that anyway. Fortunately—or unfortunately—I arrived in time to exchange a last line with the driver of a Scarborough refuse lorry which had run over the offending mess leaving me with the problem of what to do next.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Bill because I have experienced the problem. People should be expected to clean up and have responsibility for their dogs' messes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Denham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southampton, Itchen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman explain how the Bill would have assisted him under those circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sykes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would have assisted me because most of my constituents would have realised that I had a duty to clear up the mess. I am pleased to have an intervention from the hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham), although I do not need his assistance to keep me going and he can get himself going quite happily. But as his hon. Friend the Member for Burnley has been sitting like a tired old wolf throughout our proceedings, it is nice to see him joined by some of his colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read last week's 	<i>Hansard</i> with great interest to see what contributions were made. It is nice to see the hon. Member for Burnley joined by other members of the pack, some of whom are not here—perhaps they are in kennels or in season; we do not know. The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish led us astray by mentioning the Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart case, which I had not heard of before. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mrs. Jackson) took us on an interesting dash around Wharncliffe Chase. The hon. Member for Itchen cocked his leg at responsibilities of dog ownership. The bleeper of the hon. Member for Stockport (Ms Coffey) made a clearer and more concise contribution than she did. Perhaps she should use it more often.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will have important effects throughout the country, so it is right that we should debate its contents in full. The Bill will be of immense benefit to people in my constituency, which is already a clean and wonderful place to visit, but it will create a duty of care that is obviously important. I have great pleasure in supporting my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is the essence of the Bill. I support the Bill and, therefore, the clause. I obtained details of the powers that will be superseded by these provisions. They include section 235 of the Local Government Act 1972, section 164 of the Public Health Act 1875, sections 12 and 15 of the Open Spaces Act 1906, sections 82 and 83 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act 1907, section 41 of the Countryside Act 1968, section 1 of the Commons Act 1899, sections 20 and 90 of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, section 23 of the Housing Act 1985, section 214 and schedule 26 to the Local Government Act 1972. All those pieces of legislation cover the granting of byelaws to local authorities, which will now be replaced by this one piece
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
of legislation. We talked earlier about regulation, deregulation and too much activity by Government, so we should welcome this legislation because it will considerably simplify the existing provisions. On that ground alone, the legislation is welcome and the clause is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask a few questions that my hon. Friend the Minister or my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North may be able to answer. We have referred several times to areas of potential designation. Clearly, national parks could be covered by designation under the clause. Do my hon. Friends consider that, under the provisions of clause 1(1)(b)—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the owner, occupier or other person or authority having control of the land"</p></blockquote>
—will be able to override the local authority's power granted by the Bill? In other words, will the landowner be able to say that, although the local authority has designated land to which the Bill applies, he does not object to someone who does not clear up faeces? Who is the relevant person under clause 1(1)(b) in the case of a national park or an area of common land? It is the farmer or owner of a national park, and does it preclude the national park authority? To what extent is there a conflict in clause 1(1)(b), which does not set out the owner, occupier and person with control of the land each in separate subsections—a series of separate individuals or organisations, each of which could give consent—but instead, lumps them together? What happens if there is a conflict between the owner of the land and the person with control of the land, who may be two different people or organisations? Is it intended that either of them should be able to give consent, which would override the designation powers, or must they agree? That is not entirely clear from the Bill and some explanation would be welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the situation with common land? For the purposes of clause 1(1)(b), is anyone deemed to be the owner, occupier or person with control? What about people who have grazing rights over common land, such as in the New Forest? Would they be occupiers for these purposes and could they give consent? Can my hon. Friend the Minister or my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North give me some guidance on those important and difficult points?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will be applicable to areas that are generally open to the public; nobody objects to that. But what about areas that are open to the public on a specific day, for a show for example? I assume that if there were an entrance charge, the provisions of the Bill would not apply. If access is given for free visits to a garden—it could be funded by people buying plants—would that be a designated area for which the local authority could make an order? It is unlikely that most local authorities would even contemplate making an order in those circumstances, but we need to know what potential powers are being given to local authorities to interfere in the general use of land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about car boot sales when the public have access to a field where vehicles are displaying goods for sale? Could a local authority extend designation to that field? I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0285">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
think that it probably could, even though the car boot sale may be held only once a year. What about the person with control of that land under clauses 1(1)(b)? Clarification would be useful because we do not want local authorities to have excessive powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like clarification on the definition of "open to the air" in clause 1(6). Would that include land covered by a marquee, the sides of which are rolled up? Would it include stadiums if there were no admission charge? I believe that the provisions of the Bill do not apply if a charge is made, but clarification on that point would be helpful. Let us assume that it is land for which no charge for admission is made, am I right in thinking that the interpretation could include arenas, stadiums and even a marquee with its sides rolled up?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions are potentially extremely wide and before we finally endorse the clause we must be sure that we are not giving local authorities excessive powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said earlier that I hoped that the debate on clause stand part would give us the opportunity to examine some of the wider provisions of the Bill. I do not intend taking the Committee on a walk through leafy Surrey, but I should like to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North on introducing this timely and significant measure which will be very much in the interests of residents in all constituencies. It is not a glamourous Bill by any stretch of the imagination, but my hon. Friend must realise that it will stick to his name tenaciously for many years to come. I wish the Bill all speed and I wish my hon. Friend every success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important matter that causes great concern. There has been controversy recently about large-scale dumping—the Brent Spar issue is very much in our minds today. I am indebted to my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment and Countryside, who, in answer to a parliamentary question from my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Mr. Carlisle), told the House that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the pet advisory committee has estimated that approximately 1,200 tonnes of faeces are produced each day by dogs in the United Kingdom."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 14 December 1995; Vol. 251, c. 	<i>664</i>]</p></blockquote>
That is large-scale dumping and the problems that it causes are many and various. I have received letters from constituents and, in March, I received a petition signed by more than 120 residents of South Godstone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for mentioning the tonnage of faeces. Is he also aware that the Pet Advisory Committee said that, in each gram of faeces, there can be as many as 10,000 eggs and that the average daily amount of faeces per dog is between 100 gm and 150 gm. That is a shocking statistic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a shocking and deeply unpleasant statistic. However, it is an unsavoury subject and it is important that such facts should be laid at the disposal of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
I referred to the petition that I received from my constituent, Miss Shannon, in March. Miss Shannon also wrote me a lengthy letter in which she referred to the concern felt by many people, especially the parents of young children, about the toxocara worm which can infect young children in a particularly unpleasant way. She wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Not only is that worrying in itself, it"—</p></blockquote>
she refers to dogs' deposits—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is one of the most unpleasant things to have had trodden in the house carpets, car, pram wheels … need I go on!!!!"</p></blockquote>
Later in her letter, she says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"All along Lagham Road are grass verges at the roadside. I was disgusted yesterday to count seven piles of 'dog muck' on our verge alone, not including the footprints of 'dog's muck' on the pavement I had to wash down the day before."</p></blockquote>
At the beginning of June, I received a letter from Mr. Balmforth of Caterham, who told me of a walk that he took on Saturday 3 June. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The distance was about 150 yards, and along that straight line, I noticed, and avoided with care, fourteen deposits of dog faeces. This was within a public recreation ground used alike by children and adults."</p></blockquote>
Our constituents face such problems every day. We are all heartily sick of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham spoke eloquently on behalf of dog owners. None of us would seek unacceptably to restrict dog ownership. However, as well as passing legislation, we should spread a culture of responsibility among those who own dogs. My family and I live not in my constituency but in central London. I cannot escape from the belief that far too many dog owners in central London live in conditions unsuitable for dogs, and they are not responsible about the environment when they take those dogs out—which they do to infrequently—to allow them exercise and the chance to relieve themselves. As the hon. Member for Burnley said, Wandsworth—which is where I live—has a serious problem. If a council as efficient as Wandsworth has a problem, we should think how appalling the problem must be in places such as Camden, Lambeth and Islington. We should all be grateful to my hon. Friend for introducing the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1993, the Tidy Britain Group undertook a survey, which showed that one in six public places was fouled by dog deposits. Moreover, it found that one in three off-street areas suffered the same problem. From my experience, I am surprised that the figures were not worse than that. However, the present figures are bad enough. They are unacceptable and the problem must be dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to explore with my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and the Minister the purpose of the Bill.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0286">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
My hon. Friend will be aware of existing legislation under which local authorities can take some action. I received information from the Library, which said that the Environmental Protection Act 1990 gave a duty to local authorities to keep public areas free of litter and refuse as far as was practically possible. It also introduced the offence of dropping litter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A problem arises, however, with the difference in definition of refuse and litter. Under the Litter (Animal Droppings) Order 1991, the meaning of the word "refuse" was extended to include dog faeces. That applied only to dogs' mess in parks, recreation grounds, open spaces and playgrounds, beaches and promenades, picnic sites and off-street parking areas. It did not include heathland, woodland, grazing areas, and more importantly, nor did it include pavements, grass verges, footpaths and gutters—the areas that are of most concern to our constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been argued that such areas are covered under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. The penalties for littering under that Act, however, cannot and do not apply to dog faeces because it is deemed under law that only a person can be guilty of causing litter. My hon. Friend the Minister will no doubt correct me if I am wrong about that. As a result, a great number of byelaws attempt to cover the problem instead of there being national legislation about it. They are complex, cumbersome and inconsistent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until recently, the Government's thinking was that such problems can be much better addressed at local level, given that they vary from place to place. The Government now seem to have had a change of heart. The Minister has made it clear that he supports my hon. Friend's Bill and I should be grateful if he could explain exactly the Government's view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to reiterate my thanks to my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North. When the Bill is enacted, many people will have a great deal to thank him for because of his splendid initiative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Ann Coffey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stockport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Hill, for not having been present earlier in the debate. I had a longstanding engagement. When I agreed to be a member of the Committee, I anticipated only one sitting because what is such an eminently sensible Bill has cross-party support. I thought that we would have a short, constructive debate in that one sitting and that the Bill would pass quickly through the legislative process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to prevent the Minister from responding to the debate but, given the number of Conservative Members who want to speak, I can see that the hon. Gentleman will not get the chance to do so today. I thought that I might as well take up the Committee's time instead of Conservative Members doing so—on the basis that I may have something more sensible to say than has been said so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Stockport council, like other councils, has found it enormously difficult to persuade people to prevent their dogs from defecating in certain places. Many methods of doing so have been tried, including dog-free areas, which have not worked. It has been argued that people have to walk their dogs somewhere and, especially in urban areas parks and open spaces are the only places where dogs can be walked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Interestingly, over the past few months, a pooper-scooper movement has taken off. People are beginning to realise that if they simply cleaned up after their dogs, there would not have to be dog-free areas. There would be no problem; people could walk their dogs freely. The Bill is an excellent piece of legislation because it will enable local councils to designate areas in which people will be asked to clean up after their dogs and, if they do not do so, they will be subjected to hefty fines. Sadly, people often think that a measure is not meant seriously until a serious penalty is attached to it. Of course, there are problems in identifying those who should be prosecuted. But that is not the real issue. The real issue is that we should say that the problem is serious enough to institute a fine. That would mean that the vast majority of people would get into the habit of cleaning up after their dogs, which would become the social norm. Those who do not clean up will become social pariahs. The Bill is excellent, and we should proceed with it as quickly as possible so that my constituents can benefit from it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to speak in the clause stand part debate, not least because clause 1 is the heart of the matter. Clause 1 is the core of the Bill because it creates the offence of failing to clear up after one's dog if it defecates on land designated by a local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has been wide ranging. I am pleased that at least one of my amendments has been accepted wholeheartedly by every member of the Committee who happened to be present. I want no one outside to gain the impression that we are attacking dog owners. After all, dogs are man's best friend. They provide many of us with great pleasure, comfort, solace and aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is a whole-step change in our attitude towards our pets. We must encourage people to be responsible pet owners. If we cannot do that and they will not respond, we must legislate so that they will become responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said earlier that some of the pet companies had been reluctant to produce devices to remove dog faeces. I hope that the Bill, especially clause 1, will encourage pet companies to produce more devices that will be of help to dog owners. It would be nice if pet food companies used such devices as incentives in marketing. I hope that Pedigree, Woofit mix and Spillers and all the other dog accessory or dog food manufacturers will take a great deal of notice of the Bill and support what my hon.

Lady think that her name will be associated—as it rightly should be—with the fact that she is the scourge of the pooper-scooper or with the device that she demonstrated to us earlier? Will that become known as the Gillan device?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far be it from me, a humble Back Bencher and Committee member, to take any credit from my hon. Friend who has championed this cause and has made a great name for himself. The Bill is popular even with pet owners such as myself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sykes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right to draw the Committee's attention to the wonderful work of my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North, but we have all not least the hon. Member for Burnley, played our role during the Committee's proceedings. I should point out to the hon. Member for Stockport that it was the hon. Member for Burnley, not a Conservative Committee member, who tabled a manuscript amendment last week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention. I shall wind up quickly. What I like about the Bill, especially clause 1, is that it follows the principle that the polluter pays. As the dog cannot be held responsible for its actions, the owner must be held responsible. That is a fundamental part of the Government's environmental policy, the spirit of which the clause follows.

I hope that clearing up after one's dog will become a habit and a matter of course. This morning, I took my pooper-scooper out on the streets of London with my dog Tizzy. After she had had her morning movement, I bent over to pick it up and somebody said to me, "I have never seen anyone do that before." Let us hope that the Bill and the clause will result in all dog owners walking the streets, parks, lanes or byways with their dog on a lead in one hand and their device for collecting faeces in the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should tell the hon. Member for Blackpool, North that, last night, I was at a meeting with a large number of supporters of his Bill. They were also supporters of the League Against Cruel Sports because they were animal lovers in all senses. Many of them are deeply disappointed by the slow progress of the Bill, which they believe is a deliberate attempt to prevent the Wild Mammals (Protection) Bill from reaching Committee stage. They are interested in who is responsible for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
