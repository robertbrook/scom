	<p>[MR. NORMAN HOGG 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman's</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>attention having been called to the fact that six Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room and six Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. If the right hon. Member for Manchester, Wythenshawe (Mr. Morris) had been here, it might have been more appropriate for him to have considered, privately or publicly, whether it was the intention of members of the Committee to adjourn as a mark of respect for the late Harold Wilson. I do not know if this point of order is in order; in terms of the practical consequence, it is not necessary, but it might be regarded as suitable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter not for the Chair but for the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes) who is in charge of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we would all wish to express our respects to the memory of Lord Wilson. I understand that the House is making arrangements to do that this afternoon and I am sure that we will all want to be there for the occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am certain that Lord Wilson, because of attitudes and values that he expressed and the influence that he had on many of us in the Labour party, would have wanted us to continue with this type of Bill today. The point of order, however, was appropriate because it ensures that we will go on record as having paid our considerable respects to the memory of a great politician to whom we in the Labour party are tremendously indebted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. I find the hon. Gentleman's words persuasive. It might be worth adding that it was during Harold Wilson's time as Prime Minister that the distinguished series of moves towards improving the lot of those who suffer from disabilities was begun.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Social Security and Disabled People (Mr. William Hague)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be delighted to hear that I have only a few brief comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 10 is a small and straightforward clause and I do not have any questions about it. As we explained during debates on the Government's Disability Discrimination
	<span class='label label-info column'>202</span>
Bill, the Government consider that certain narrowly defined exemptions from the legislation are justified in relation to occupations with unusually demanding, all-round requirements for fitness and stamina. One of those occupations is that of police officer. We have, however, debated that on the Floor of the House and hon. Members reached a decision on the matter. I am not sure that it would serve the Committee well to go over all that ground again, but I put that marker down. I am sure that since the House has reached a decision, it will be necessary to return to the matter similarly on the Floor of the House in any further stages of the Bill, but I do not propose to detain the Committee by arguing about it today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 10 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 11</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>LIABILITY OF EMPLOYERS AND PRINCIPALS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 35, in page 8, line 8, leave out from "Act" to first "as" in line 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is a probing amendment of the type that kept us amused in the previous sitting. It is directed at the words in clause 11(1):
	<br><blockquote><p>"except as regards offences thereunder".</p></blockquote>
I do not want to change the clause in any way; I am, however, mystified as to what the phrase means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There might be a straightforward explanation. If the intention is simply to ensure that an employer cannot be held vicariously liable under the Bill for any action by an employee that is a criminal offence, as opposed to an infringement of a civil right, the Government would not object to the phrase. Indeed, that would be in line with the Disability Discrimination Bill. It is not clear, however, that that is the intention behind the phrase. Although the phrase refers to criminal offences, the Bill does not appear to create any. I should therefore be grateful for further explanation of the phrase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The intention is the one the Minister suggested. If he feels that the wording is inappropriate and does not express that intention, he should elaborate his concerns now so that we know where we stand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The wording probably is inappropriate because I do not understand it, although some people might. That suggests, however, that other people who have to interpret the law would not understand the phrase either and that it needs tidying up. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that my interpretation of the phrase was correct, however, we have established what it is meant to mean. The meaning does, however, take some working out. Members of the Committee might consider whether and how the phrase should be amended later. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 36, in page 8, line 14, at end insert—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0205">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>203</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"() Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply in relation to an offence under section 	<i>(Aiding unlawful acts)</i>(4).".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss new clause 12—	<i>Aiding unlawful acts</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>".—(1) A person who knowingly aids another person to do an act made unlawful by this Act is to be treated for the purposes of this Act as himself doing the same kind of unlawful act.
	<ol>
	<li>For the purpose of subsection (1), an employee or agent for whose act the employer or principal is liable under section 11 (or would be so liable but for section 11(3)) shall be taken to have aided the employer or principal to do the act.</li>
	<li>For the purposes of this section, a person does not knowingly aid another to do an unlawful act if—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>he acts in reliance on a statement made to him by that other person that, because of any provision of this Act, the act would not be unlawful; and</li>
	<li>it is reasonable for him to rely on the statement.</li></ol>
	<li>a person who knowingly or recklessly makes such a statement which is false or misleading in a material respect commits an offence.</li>
	<li>Any person found guilty of an offence under subsection (4) shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale.".</li></ol></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New clause 12, which mirrors a provision in the Government's Disability Discrimination Bill, addresses the situation in which one person knowingly aids another to commit an unlawful act of discrimination. The Government consider it only right that disabled people should be able to take action against those who help others to discriminate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 36 is a technical amendment and is designed to fit the new clause into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the new clause, those who knowingly aid others in discriminatory acts against disabled people would be treated as if they themselves had committed the acts in question. It would ensure that, in any relationship between an employer and an employee, the employee was liable for his or her own acts, as well as the employer. The same would apply to relationships between agents and their principals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would be a defence for those who relied on the statement of someone else that an act was lawful, if it were reasonable for them to have done so. Those who led someone else into aiding an unlawful act by making a false statement that the act was lawful would be committing an offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Aiding unlawful acts is covered in the race and sex discrimination legislation, and there is no reason why it should not be similarly covered in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Committee to support the new clause and its associated amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister could further explain one aspect of new clause 12. New subsection 3(a) refers to someone acting on the basis of a statement. That would cover the employer, who would not then have knowingly acted unlawfully. What form of statement is envisaged? There is a danger that an employee or someone acting under an agent might have provided the statement. It
	<span class='label label-info column'>204</span>
might have had to be accepted as part of someone's contract of employment. In those circumstances, an employer would be evading responsibility under the Bill on account of that statement. Perhaps the Minister would clarify the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Gentleman should be unduly concerned about that. This part of the new clause is directed simply to achieving the objective to which I referred a moment ago—someone will have a defence if relying on a statement made by another person to the effect that an act was lawful. The defence would hold only if it was reasonable for them to rely on that statement. The act of the person making the statement could be unlawful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the difficulty feared by the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East would not arise. Whoever initiated the statement or advice would be acting against the legislation. No loophole is created. The purpose of the new clause is to broaden the Bill to cover those who knowingly aid others to commit an unlawful act. If the hon. Gentleman has specific doubts about specific sentences, he could return to them later; but it is important for the Committee to accept the principle of the new clause—that aiding unlawful acts should be covered by any anti-discrimination legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Corbett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Erdington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's point. Is the "statement" referred to in the new clause oral or written, or does it apply only to oral statements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it could be a written or oral statement. In either event, the important fact is that anyone knowingly making a misleading statement would be committing an unlawful act. No damage whatever is done by the new clause. I sincerely believe that it will improve the Bill and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not convinced by the Minister's points. Clause 11 is a standard common law-type provision. The problem about the nature of statements remains. The addition of the new clause would allow an employer to avoid responsibilities which are properly his. So I stand by clause 11 and resist the inclusion of the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The wording here is the same as in sex and race anti-discrimination legislation. No one has raised any problem in the past 20 years to do with any such loophole as the hon. Gentleman fears. The wording, I stress, is exactly the same as in the other legislation. We are simply trying to cover an important aspect of anti-discrimination legislation. It is covered in the Disability Discrimination Bill and it should be covered in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East may not have found my way of expressing the point very persuasive. However, there are powerful arguments in favour, so I ask the Committee to support me in voting for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>PROVISION OF GOODS AND SERVICES TO A QUALIFIED DISABLED PERSON</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 38, in page 8, line 28, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"or denying the benefits of.</p></blockquote>
After that ringing victory, I shall advocate a number of other important amendments, although I would not necessarily class this amendment as one of the most critical. It is another probing amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 12(2)(a) gives as an example of discrimination the situation in which someone excludes or denies a disabled person the benefits of any programme or activity in relation to goods and services. The amendment is an attempt to clear up any confusion caused by clause 12(2)(a) as a whole and by the reference to "denying the benefits of in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, I think that the reference in line 27 should be to "section 1 above", not "section 2 above". I have not tabled an amendment to that effect, but the subsection makes no sense to me unless it is meant to refer to "section 1 above". Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would consider amending it later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman would assist the Committee if he were to tell us where the phrase "denying the benefits of has come from and give us an example of what it is meant to be countering. Given the generality of the outlawing of discrimination under clause 12, which is very broad, I assume that he is trying to deal with a specific worry and he should make that clear before we proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall concentrate on amendment No. 38 and then I shall say something about the section number to which the Minister referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The broadening of the provision beyond any programme or activity in relation to goods, services and facilities by including a reference to "or denying the benefits of any such programme or activity is not merely an elaboration to include words that have no legal import. Disabled people may be denied the benefits of goods, services and facilities if they are not available to them. Disabled people would derive a benefit if they were dependent on computer facilities and telephone links with other people. Also, with regard to purchasing goods and services, a person's ability to understand what is on offer and to engage in the full shopping activity is part of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>206</span>
benefit to be derived in connection with goods, services and facilities. Therefore, the phrase has meaning and legal import.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the reference to "section 2, above" cannot be correct, and that the reference should be to subsection (1).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Another explanation is that the reference is to clause 2, which is the general definition of discrimination earlier in the Bill. My initial thought was that the reference must be to clause 12(1), but further examination renders that unlikely. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that that reference must be corrected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It occurred to me as I was speaking that the question is whether we are speaking about a section or a subsection. Certainly, there would be no logic in subsection (2) referring to itself, so the reference—if it is to a subsection—must be to a different one. Therefore, the reference should be to the definition of discrimination in clause 2, and the Minister is right that the Bill needs to be corrected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there is a problem with the reference to section 2, which is the section of the Bill that defines discrimination. The paragraphs in clause 12(2) are descriptions of discrimination in relation to the provision of "goods, facilities and services". Those examples do not prejudice the general definition in clause 2, which would become section 2 if the Bill were enacted. I am sorry to disagree with my hon. Friend the Minister, but if the Bill were referring to a subsection, it would say so. However, its reference is to section 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand why clause 12(2)(a) contains no reference to "qualified disabled persons". All the other paragraphs describing what discrimination means in the context of the clause contain such a reference. Does the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East agree that the clause would read better if clause 12(2)(a) began:
	<br><blockquote><p>"excluding qualified disabled persons from, or denying to qualified disabled persons, the benefits of",</p></blockquote>
and so on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Berry 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingswood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no difficulty with clause 12(2)(a), nor with understanding what is meant by "denying the benefits of. As the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) said, that paragraph gives examples of the type of discrimination that the clause would outlaw, within the generality of the provisions of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause would ensure that disabled people were not denied the benefits of a whole range of activities, such as a mobile library scheme, home care or training programmes. It is self-evident that the clause states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"any programme or activity in relation to … goods, facilities or services".</p></blockquote>
it would be unlawful if a disabled person were excluded from or denied the benefits of
	<br><blockquote><p>"any programme or activity in relation to … goods, services or facilities".</p></blockquote>
We could all think of countless examples; I have mentioned three off the top of my head. I do not see the purpose of an amendment that seeks to delete "denying the benefits of. I do not understand the Minister's problem with the wording of clause 12(2)(a).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0207">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>207</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the hon. Gentleman says; I do not necessarily want to remove that phrase. I said earlier that it was a probing amendment. Presumably 12(2)(a) is targeted at such things as special offers in a supermarket, from the fear that a disabled person might be excluded from a "Buy two cans and get a third one free" offer or that he might not be able to enter a competition for which a qualification was a particular purpose. Other examples were given earlier. I do not oppose the inclusion of the paragraph in the clause; there might be some situations in which it could be of use. However, I seek to clarify those situations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also accept the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) and I stand corrected. If he is right, "section 2" is a reference to clause 2 and would therefore be the correct terminology if the Bill becomes an Act. So I also withdraw my objections to that. Having talked myself out of all my objections, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 41, in page 8, line 36, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(cc) providing goods, services or facilities to a disabled person on terms which are less favourable than those on which the goods, services or facilities are provided to others;".</p></blockquote>
The amendment is more important than the previous one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that the intention of clause 12 is to take account of the relationship between two parties—a service provider and a disabled person who wishes to avail himself of the service in question. Clause 12(c) protects disabled people from a service provider using standards, criteria or methods of administration that discriminate against them. But the legislation does not comprehensively cover all the circumstances in which goods, facilities and services might be obtained. It neglects to include non-discrimination in the terms on which goods, facilities and services are provided. The Bill as drafted would allow a service provider to offer, for entirely spurious reasons, a lower standard of service to a disabled person than is accorded to other customers. Why is not that dealt with in the Bill? Is it meant to be dealt with in some other way?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not intend the amendment to be considered in isolation. As I have said on other occasions, there will be circumstances in which it would be reasonable for a service provider to treat a disabled person differently—in order, for example, not to endanger the health and safety of any person, including the disabled person himself; where the service provider legitimately considers that a disabled person would not be capable of entering into an enforceable agreement; or where provision of a service under the usual terms would make unreasonable financial demands on the service provider to the extent that he or she could not continue to provide the service. I shall return to the subject of less fair treatment in greater detail. The amendment would improve the legislation and I invite the Committee to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to accept the amendment.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are progressing to more substantial groups of amendments to clause 12. We shall come later to amendments Nos. 57 and 58 to clause 14, which deals with the Bill's test of reasonableness and with the concept of undue hardship. However, if we deal with those issues now, we might be able to deal with amendments Nos. 57 and 58 more quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to refer to the concepts now because they are relevant to the amendments to clause 12 and to the notion of "undue hardship". Clause 12 requires a service provider to make a reasonable accommodation where that does not cause undue hardship to his or her business. We had a parallel debate on part III about the use of the same terminology in employment matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A fairer, clearer and more flexible test of reasonableness is required, and the most workable approach is to define in regulations the circumstances in which it would be reasonable or unreasonable for a service provider to make a modification of a prescribed kind, by reference to such factors as the potential cost of a modification and the benefit that it might bring to disabled customers. Amendment No. 58 would permit that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 42 is closely bound up with amendments Nos. 44, 49 and 50, so I should first like to speak to those other amendments. Amendments Nos. 44, 49 and 50 respectively seek to remove the reference to "undue hardship" when a service provider is required to make his or her service available to a disabled person in relation to the modifications a service provider would need to make to rules, policies or procedures, to the removal of architectural and communication barriers, and to the provision of auxiliary aids and services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 14 sets out the factors to be taken into account in determining whether modifications to rules, policies or practices, the removal of barriers and the provisions of auxiliary aids and services could be undertaken without undue hardship. Factors cited include the nature and cost of the actions in question: the financial resources of the business concerned and the impact of the modification on it; and the availability of public funds to defray the cost of an accommodation. We amended that terminology in part III.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I do not take exception to those factors in themselves, I think that the approach taken here is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>209</span>
inflexible. It is highly unlikely that clause 14(1) could specify every factor that might need to be considered. If that is the case, circumstances may well arise in which the provisions offered no help to service providers, disabled people or to the courts in deciding whether an accommodation was reasonable or would cause "undue hardship".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's approach in their Bill is to set out in regulations the circumstances under which it would be reasonable for a service provider to make a modification. In that way we could be sure that the mechanism was in place to address any problems that might arise in the interpretation of the legislation. How would the hon. Gentleman's Bill address such situations, and what guidance would it give to service providers who were about to undertake significant changes? Would those be matters for the courts?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am especially concerned about the notion of "undue hardship". It would present too strict and unwieldy a test for service providers. It might even bring a service provider to the brink of jeopardising the well-being of his or her business, as seems to have been the case in the United States under the Americans with Disabilities Act in a small number of cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very small.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but that is no consolation for the people involved in those cases. The Committee might be aware of a recent report entitled "The Federal Implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 1991–94" by the Millbank Memorial Fund. The report shows some worrying signs that some businesses might have been forced to close because of the costs incurred by compliance. For example, there have been reports on the closure of two restaurants. Trader Vic's flagship restaurant in San Francisco was closed for renovations in order to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. When the report went to press, it was uncertain whether that restaurant would ever reopen. Max's Eats in Oakland closed because of the expense of becoming accessible after a lawsuit filed under the ADA. So there is evidence of problems, even though the legislation has been framed there, as here, with the best of intentions. There was no intention to drive people out of business, but sometimes a difficult situation can be created and the courts are unsure what was intended by reasonable modifications. How reasonable is reasonable?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have argued before, it is vital to secure the co-operation of service providers, and one way to help ensure that we take them with us in the attempt to eliminate discrimination against disabled people is to be clear about the new duties imposed by the Bill. Once again, I am worried that the Bill relies on the courts to interpret and establish duties with insufficient guidance from Parliament. In that spirit, I commend the amendments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is correct to trawl wider than the immediate amendments before us, which tie in with a package of other amendments. However, we must stress the benefits that will accrue to businesses, as providers of goods and services, from the Bill. It is good commercial practice to ensure that disabled people have access to goods and services and share in much wider markets. The American cases mentioned by the Minister should be seen
	<span class='label label-info column'>210</span>
in the wider context—the swings and roundabouts of introducing this sort of legislation. Experience in America suggests that considerable benefits are to be had from this type of anti-discrimination measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's amendments show that he continues to pursue his own legislation, which has already had its Second Reading in another place. However, we are debating a Bill which has already made considerable progress in this Committee and whose basic principles have been agreed. The Minister is pushing the notion once again that regulation under the control of the Secretary of State should be to the fore in interpreting the measures. It is not a matter of the say of the House: it depends on the regulations that are adopted and on whether the House has an opportunity to consider them. We are suggesting the alternative approach, stressing the role of the Disability Rights Commission in producing codes of practice and reporting regularly and directly to Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not against the Minister having some say in regulations, and the Bill covers that in dealing with specific exemptions that the Minister can bring forward. So it is not an absolute divide between us. It is a disagreement about the best approach to improve the lot of disabled people and to enable them to participate as fully as possible in society—and more specifically in this part of the Bill, with the take-up of goods and services. It may be only a minor amendment in itself, but it is important because it embraces much wider considerations, as the Minister himself acknowledged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned about the concept of "undue hardship". The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East keeps talking about the benefits that will come to industry and commerce from legislation of this kind, but I think that that is a hopelessly naive and unrealistically optimistic view of the attitude that industry and commerce are likely to adopt. The fact is that most businesses have no choice and must be more cost-conscious than they have ever been before. They are trying to drive down costs and are very concerned about any impositions which come from new regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only yesterday I had a letter from a constituent who complained about some building regulations relating to access for the disabled which are being introduced by the Department of the Environment. He stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In my opinion the consequences of this legislation will be much more serious than most people realise. It will have a massive cost effect on our industry as a whole, affecting every new dwelling built, at a time when our already overburdened industry struggles out of recession.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I can see many companies having difficulty in taking these requirements on board, which are technically difficult to implement. There are bound to be casualties across the board should this legislation be imposed."</p></blockquote>
He is talking about regulations that the Government are currently introducing. I suspect that in that particular case, his fears are unfounded because, although there will be extra costs, they will apply to all builders of new homes. I may be wrong, but my constituent is working in an industry that is still struggling hard to recover from deep recession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman. He will probably be aware that the National Federation of Housing Associations has launched a drive, under the heading of "Homes for Life", whereby every new home will be built so that people with disabilities can use it. It
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>211</span>
says—and I agree—that the question of cost alone is the wrong approach to take. The challenge is to build in such specifications for a reasonable amount of money and it is a challenge for architects and home designers, not for the builders themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But there are bound to be extra costs. One cannot, for example, build a lavatory for the disabled within the same number of square feet as a lavatory for the able-bodied; it is not possible. I am not querying that but I believe that those costs are justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not want to get into a debate about that specific regulation. My point is that today's businesses are already concerned about the costs of regulations which are being introduced under legislation that is already in force. The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East says that only in cases where "undue hardship" will be imposed on businesses will there be any escape from clause 12.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 14 expands on the test of undue hardship. The circumstances that are envisaged take into account
	<br><blockquote><p>"the nature and cost of the actions in question"</p></blockquote>
but also relevant are
	<br><blockquote><p>"the overall financial resources of the person or body concerned and the effect on the expenses and resources, or the impact of such actions upon the operations, of the person or body".</p></blockquote>
What does all that verbiage mean? We do not really know, but it could well mean that a court would take the view that as we are talking about undue hardship—hardship itself is a tough enough test—the clause will merely allow the courts to rescue businesses that are about to go bankrupt, into liquidation or into receivership. What else can it possibly mean?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a very tough test and an unreasonable one. If we pursue that course, I do not think that we will be able to persuade people of the benefits that will accrue. The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East talked in general terms about the benefits which will accrue to industry, but I do not think that people will see it like that. Whether we like it or not, they will perceive the measure as involving extra costs with no obvious extra benefits. That is why it is so important that we get the balance between the two right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The promoters of the Bill have been trying desperately to get the balance right, otherwise there would not have been a concept of undue hardship in the first place. That concept is a recognition that we are seeking to secure rights for people but it must be done without imposing undue hardship on others. That is the framework. I wish it were acknowledged more often that the Bill is drafted specifically to achieve that balance. Some might think that it goes a little too far in the opposite direction to that which my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Corbett) has in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister raised two points, one of which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East said, returns to old arguments. Of course, all hon. Members accept that the requirements imposed on those who provide goods, services and facilities must be clear so as to minimise costs and uncertainty. Such clarity could be achieved through regulation or through consultation by a
	<span class='label label-info column'>212</span>
disability rights commission on codes of practice. Frankly, I have become almost agnostic about the mechanism: there is no disagreement about the need to flesh out the bones of the Bill to clarify the requirements. That was the intention of those who drafted the Bill, and I suspect that it was the intention of those who drafted the Disability Discrimination Bill. That Bill also lacks clarity, as no enforcement mechanism has been provided for it. Goodness knows what firms and suppliers of goods, services and facilities will make of that Bill in the absence of an enforcement mechanism for its provisions. The promoters of this Bill are not the only ones who must answer questions about requirements; the Minister himself must answer the same questions in relation to the Disability Discrimination Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument about costs arises from the assumption that regulations impose costs. This Bill is about regulating behaviour, as is the Government Bill. The Disability Discrimination Bill is probably the only example of increased regulation of the labour market since 1979. I welcome that and the fact that the Government have accepted the principle that anti-discrimination legislation requires regulation. Anti-regulation rhetoric may be appropriate in other debates, but it is inappropriate in this Committee as the premise of the Government's own approach—rightly—is that regulation is necessary and that matters cannot be left to chance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So much for the common ground between us. What is not common ground is the assertion that regulations impose costs, full stop. I believe that regulations impose both costs and benefits. I am slightly irritated by the notion that benefits cannot accrue from regulation. There would be direct benefits to disabled people, as well as economic benefits to the firms concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman has not heard about it, I shall give him the example of the pizza parlour in New Jersey which provided facilities so that people with hearing impairments could order take-away pizzas. The investment in setting up that system was recouped in three months. British industry would be over the moon at achieving what amounts to a 400 per cent. return on capital. There are countless other examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Success in ensuring equal access to goods, services and facilities would mean that 6.5 million disabled people, and their many friends and relatives, could gain access to those goods, services and facilities which previously was denied them. One does not need great knowledge of economics to realise that that represents a market opportunity, as many examples show. The United States is not known as an anti-business community. It is probably about as pro-business as any economy in the world. Business there has not been up in arms against the ADA because it realises that the costs involved in meeting the legislation's requirements are offset by the economic benefits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it true, as 	<i>The Times</i> suggested in a leading article yesterday, that some properties in the United States have just been closed down because the cost of adapting them is so great?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know. I shall happily contact 	<i>The Times</i> immediately, ask for the source of its information
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0210">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>213</span>
and investigate the matter. I have never heard that suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that some firms—his phrase was, I think, "a small number of firms"—have encountered financial difficulties. He rightly rebuked me when I said that a very small number of firms had been affected. But what happened when legislation on health and safety and on unfair dismissal was introduced? What happens every time new legislation imposes an additional obligation on employers or providers of goods, services and facilities? Someone will always say, "Goodness gracious me, this will cause me financial difficulties."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not deny that requirements will be imposed on suppliers of goods, services and facilities—the Bill will fail if that does not happen. There will be requirements and costs. We should, however, recognise that there will also be benefits and that modest costs have been imposed on business in countless other examples of legislation that have been passed by the House. Indeed, the hon. Member for Beaconsfield referred to legislation that the Government are currently implementing. I do not see why we should selectively attack this Bill because it imposes such costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly not selectively criticising the Bill. I am a member of the Standing Committee that is considering the Pensions Bill and I am equally concerned about the costs involved there, as my hon. Friend the Minister can confirm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that I might have tempted the hon. Gentleman to stray from the point. We cannot overlook the benefits in the Bill and particularly the rights it gives to disabled people. It is, however, also self-evident that the economic benefits to suppliers of goods, services and facilities will be narrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right to stress that the clause has a benefit. He might remember that page eight of the Minister's compliance cost assessment of his Bill states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"many of the changes required will be achieved at negligible cost."</p></blockquote>
As the Minister's Bill and this Bill are roughly similar, the hon. Member for Beaconsfield is getting steamed up about small beer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend and I agree with him. It is important that we ensure that the requirements that the Bill imposes on suppliers of goods, services and facilities are clear. That was always the intention of the promoters of the Bill. Although the Minister might not like the phrase, we do not want to impose "undue hardship", and we recognise that costs are part of that equation. The intention behind the Bill is, as my hon. Friend said, similar to that behind part of the Government Bill. The devil, however, is in the detail, and the extent to which the regulations in the Government Bill or the code of practice in this Bill have an impact on access to goods, services and facilities will be decisive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the debate is again about costs and that there is precious little recognition of benefits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should also consider other elements in the Bill. We have considered the part of the Bill that deals with employment. Under the Bill, disabled people will
	<span class='label label-info column'>214</span>
have greater access to employment and, therefore, greater earnings opportunities. The market that disabled people represent will be expanded by other aspects of the Bill, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Hendry 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(High Peak)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The comments of the hon. Member for Kingswood (Mr. Berry) entirely missed the point of the amendments. It is not just a question of balancing costs and benefits: the question of undue hardship is causing concern. If a business that adapted itself to be more accessible to people with disabilities experienced significant benefits, and business were doubled, it would not claim undue hardship. The question of undue hardship comes in when the difference between the costs and the benefits to a company in terms of its business is considered. The test of reasonableness in clause 14 makes no mention of the benefits that the hon. Gentleman talked about. So in assessing the costs to a business, one cannot, under the terms of the Bill, also assess the benefits that may accrue to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I very much agree with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield. When the Minister talked about the number of businesses that have closed down in the United States, I was surprised to hear the hon. Member for Kingswood mutter that it was a very small number; I hope that that was picked up by the 	<i>Official Report.</i> Surely the objective of the Bill is that no business should be forced to close because of its adaptation to accommodate the needs of people with disabilities? It is disappointing that the hon. Gentleman is happy that a small number of businesses should close.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Chancellor of the Exchequer also takes account of the number of firms that have been destroyed in his next Budget. I made that comment earlier because I always assume that some businesses that go bust will attribute the reason for that to whatever is most convenient; frankly, they will make excuses. Some forms will always claim that health and safety regulations or anti-discrimination legislation have driven them under. We should not assume that it really is the case. I do not want any firm to go bust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's assurances, but there has to be an understanding of what undue hardship means. There will clearly be a legal argument about where the boundary should lie. The Bill draws a line between what hardship is reasonable for a business to incur and what is undue hardship. There is an acceptance in its phraseology that firms should be prepared to accept reasonable hardship in making the adaptions. What is the dividing line between what is reasonable and what is undue? Presumably, a business that is driven into bankruptcy by having made the necessary changes will have been faced with undue hardship but a business that stops just short of bankruptcy would not. Businesses would be placed under tremendous pressure at a time when many of them could not sustain it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be a peculiar court judgment that ruled that the only circumstances that could be considered undue hardship are those leading to bankruptcy. Financial burdens on a firm that fall short of bankruptcy can constitute undue hardship—if that were not the case, bankruptcy would have been used in the definition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>215</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Gentleman but there are many lawyers who could argue very convincingly that a firm teetering on the edge of bankruptcy was not facing undue hardship. It would certainly be facing hardship, but the fact that it would eventually come through that hardship would enable people to build an argument that it was not "undue".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be careful when making comparisons between this country and the United States. The US is a much newer country; many of the buildings concerned are much more modern and have also been built in a country where there is much more space. Americans can therefore often have larger buildings than ours. In my constituency, many of the shops are in late 19th-century or early 20th-century buildings and they would face significant costs under the provision. Such businesses would be the ones affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also consider the business environment in which the legal judgments would be made. If the economy were booming and a business were doing well, it might agree that it could undertake the capital cost because of its level of trade. But if, a couple of years later, the business environment had changed dramatically and the market had eroded significantly, the definition of "undue hardship" would be different—undue hardship at one time will not necessarily represent undue hardship two or five years later when the company might be incurring the cost of carrying out the work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be much better to have a definition that refers to reasonable costs instead of to undue hardship, because that would avoid altogether the brinkmanship of bankruptcy—or not—and we could accept that there is a legitimate interest. I accept the point that the hon. Member for Kingswood made about the benefits, but their is another side to the argument which needs to be addressed, and the amendments do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments have triggered a useful debate. I would not want to deny that there are benefits as well as costs to businesses from including disabled people. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Corbett) quoted me correctly—I have often pointed out that benefits as well as costs will accrue to businesses as we embark on the process of including disabled people. However, the point at issue here is whether we have the right framework for bringing about progress—whether the term "undue hardship" and the absence of regulation-making powers to go along with that are the right way to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was pointed out by the hon. Members for Kingswood and for Derbyshire, North-East that the commission that they envisage would be able to publish codes of practice. However, those codes would not have any legal force, a point that we debated before. I have probably made the point a sufficient number of times not to labour it now. That is my criticism of that approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have another problem with the approach, which I am not sure that I have mentioned to the Committee before, although it was remiss of me not to do so: under clause 3, the commission has 18 months after the passing of the Act to publish codes of practice. But, according to clause 38, the proposal comes into force six months after the Act is passed. There could be quite a gap between the Act
	<span class='label label-info column'>216</span>
coming into force and the commission being able to publish codes of practice, in which time there could be legal proceedings without guidance and in the absence of codes of practice intended to make clear what is meant by "reasonable accommodation" and "undue hardship". Despite their good intentions, the Bill's sponsors would find that the courts interpreted the law and created case law; the commission would then come along with its codes of practice rather late in the day, with aspects of the law already established by case law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The approach set out in the Government Bill, under which regulation-making powers and regulations would be in place before the Act came into effect, is much to be preferred.

The amendments concern the duty on service providers to remove architectural, communication and transport barriers to make the service accessible to disabled people. It may be best if I concentrate my remarks on amendment No. 46, which is the most significant, because it would leave out the word "transport" in line 42.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been argued that a right of access to goods and services is undermined if the opportunity to travel to where those services are available does not exist. I fully agree with that. The Government have, at all stages of the Disability Discrimination Bill, made clear our commitment to achieving fully accessible transport systems. We have, however, also made it clear that we believe that progress towards accessible public transport is best achieved by legislation and regulations outside the scope of this wider-ranging, anti-discrimination legislation.

As the Committee knows, I have been considering, with my hon. Friend the Minister for Transport in London, how best to meet the requirements for soundly based technical standards within the wide-ranging framework of the Disability Discrimination Bill. A power is being taken in that Bill—subject to the agreement of the other place to the amendments that Lord Mackay will move—to ensure that the Secretary of State for Transport is able to set minimum access standards for new transport vehicles, including buses, trains, trams, taxis and underground trains. Indeed, some Opposition Members tabled an amendment along those lines on Report. In the discussions on the Disability Discrimination Bill there has been a good deal of consensus on how to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That new power will provide the flexibility to tailor access solutions to the widest range of transport modes while recognising the operational issues associated with each one. That flexibility is essential to allow different time scales and standards for what can be very different modes of transport. We must recognise that the operation of the various modes of transport will inevitably require different access solutions to ensure that the approach adopted provides, as far as practicable, effective and sustainable transport for all passengers and particularly, of course, those with disabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All members of the Committee will recognise that the question of cost cannot be overlooked, notwithstanding the debate that we have just had. I believe that it makes sense to target resources on areas when they will do most good. In transport, that means concentrating on ensuring that new vehicles are built to accessible standards rather than wasting resources on making changes to old vehicles which may be coming to the end of their working lives and may be in service for only a relatively short period. Hon. Members on both sides seemed to accept that approach during the discussion on the Disability Discrimination Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Bill proposes that the problem should be tackled differently: that transport should be included in the general right of access provision to come into force six months after the passage of the Act. I do not think that that is a practical way to proceed. The only viable way to an accessible transport system is to require new transport vehicles to be fully accessible so that over time all vehicles will become accessible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee must realise that there are a great number of difficulties in making retrospective changes and in making all existing transport systems and vehicles accessible, as would be required if we were to allow the Bill to remain unamended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of difficulties in regulating for all of the types of transport listed in clause 12(3)(h). The Committee will be aware that transport operates against a very complex web of legislation, both domestic and, in some cases European, and this includes regulations as well as a large amount of primary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have already made it clear on a number of occasions during the passage of the Disability Discrimination Bill that they do not consider it appropriate to introduce domestic regulations in all of these areas. The international dimension of travel by sea or air would mean that domestic legislation would be of very limited value. Ships and aircraft beginning their journeys in the UK will be subject to the Bill on all their
	<span class='label label-info column'>218</span>
trips, and it would not matter if they were travelling on internal or intercontinental flights. UK operators would therefore be commercially disadvantaged, by comparison with their overseas counterparts, as they would be subject to additional regulatory controls in advance of similar measures in other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the aviation side, international guidelines on the accessibility of aircraft to disabled people are already well advanced. We must continue to make progress on an international basis. I understand that the International Civil Aviation Organisation is considering new proposals for improvements in access to air transport for elderly and disabled people at its conference in Montreal; but we should also recognise that we must have regard to the cost of proposals and should not put UK airlines at a disadvantage in relation to their competitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On shipping, a new group has been set up under the International Maritime Organisation to draw up guidelines for the design of new vessels. That should ensure that over time more and more ships become more and more accessible to disabled travellers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that progress within these organisations represents the best and most sensible approach to tackling the issues relating to access for aviation and shipping. I do not, therefore, think it sensible to include these transport modes within the scope of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would guidelines promulgated either nationally or internationally have legal force and, if so, what would be their basis?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The access standards planned for land-based transport will certainly have legal force—but that might not be what my hon. Friend is asking. We can say that, after a certain date, a new vehicle must be accessible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On international regulations, I am not sure off-hand of their legal status, but I imagine that they would be binding on countries that are signatories to agreements or members of organisations. I should be happy to clarify the issue further at a later stage of proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that we are talking about distinct categories of national and international guidance. In the case of guidance issued by the Government of this country, what would be its legal basis? Do the Government envisage that any guidance should be enshrined in secondary legislation; or would they expect transport providers to take account of any guidance issued? There are constitutional implications in deciding which route to take.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Access standards under provisions intended to be placed in the Disability Discrimination Bill would be set out in regulations and would have legal force. It is more complicated on the international side. Standards for land-based transport would have legal force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go into detail on every form of transport, but I want to talk about buses—a very important form of transport for disabled people. A specification for buses used for local services was issued in 1988 and has been updated by the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee. It sets out a whole series of simple low-cost improvements. Driver training is, of course, essential too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0213">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>219</span>
The next step towards improving physical access to buses is to eliminate steps at entrances and exits altogether. The new generation of buses already running in some parts of mainland Europe and being used in some areas of the United Kingdom have low, flat floors which, combined with kneeling suspension and an automatic ramp, can bring the level of the bus floor right down to the level of the kerb. That means that anyone using a wheelchair, a walking frame or a shopping trolley can get on and off the bus more quickly and easily. The Government are committed to ensuring that all new buses have low floors, as far as that is technically feasible. It is not yet quite technically feasible with some types or sizes of buses, but I have no doubt that it will be before long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Access to coaches that are used on both intercity and tourist routes presents a similar problem because of high floors, steep steps and inadequate handholds. A sub-group of the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee is working on that in an effort to explore and develop access to those problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the most difficult public transport system to make accessible is the railway and underground network. The Bill would require changes to be made to those forms of transport which would not be sensible or cost-effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both British Rail and London Underground have a legacy of Victorian infrastructure, much of which was constructed before the needs of disabled people were taken into account. Consequently, making the whole network fully accessible will take a long time. I agree that that is that target towards which we should all be working, but I doubt whether the Bill has the flexibility that is required to achieve it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the way in which to improve the accessibility of the railway network is through new build or as part as major refurbishment work. Look at the docklands light railway. Access requirements for disabled people were considered at the outset and their needs were incorporated at the design stage. The Manchester metrolink and the Sheffield supertram have incorporated similar considerations. A great deal can—and will—be done under the Disability Discrimination Bill, together with the regulations that will follow it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the right way to proceed to improve transport systems is through specially targeted regulations with legal force which set out minimum access standards for new vehicles. To say that there is a right to transport systems is one thing; expecting people to try to comply, using existing vehicles, is very different. It would lead to a lot of energy and resources being dissipated instead of being focused on ensuring that we have the right new vehicles in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many cases, such a requirement would lead to counter-productive results. Again, in the United States we have seen problems—although the hon. Member for Kingswood would tell me that they are isolated—with bus operators finding it difficult to comply with sweeping legislative requirements. If they are not ready to buy a new bus but cannot afford to modify the old bus, they withdraw the bus service altogether. That is not in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>220</span>
interests of any member of the community, let alone disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's approach to transport is mistaken. Every member of the Committee is probably agreed about what we are trying to achieve, but there is a much more practical way in which to do it. The Bill's sponsors are, of course, attached to keeping transport in the Bill because it is part of the Bill's declaratory statement; its rights are about transport as well as everything else. The real, practical way to resolve the problems is to take the power to set the minimum access standards, about which I have spoken, and to ensure that new vehicles are accessible. I hope that members of the Committee will give sympathetic consideration to that view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are starting to debate a series of amendments but our analysis of them all will be the same. Amendments Nos. 55, 53, 54 and 56 refer to clause 12(3). The same argument will be produced by the Minister for each of those amendments, to the effect that there are different means of moving in that direction and that the aims are best achieved by regulations or by other pieces of legislation. Whether it is education or transport, the same form of argument is used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the framework and principles of the Disability Discrimination Bill, there is some logic in the Minister's analysis. However, I do not accept that logic in the context of the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill, which does have the flexibility that the Minister asserts that it does not have. It contains provisions regarding qualified disabled persons and definitions in connection with reasonableness and undue hardship. It also proposes the establishment of a commission. How could the codes of practice be the same as the measures in this Bill, given the complexity of the problems involved? The approach of this Bill is entirely different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his efforts to reassure my hon. Friend the Minister, the hon. Gentleman might also point to clause 15, which would allow the Minister to make all the exemptions necessary to achieve his purposes. Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that transport is not simply a declaratory issue but an immensely practical one? No one would want to be so impractical as to require everyone to retrofit all vehicles, but would not clause 15 allow the Minister to make sensible and practical exemptions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister deals with each issue that comes up for debate in isolation, as if everything, including the problems of access faced by disabled people, must be tackled in one fell swoop and all the associated costs incurred at once. Last year's cost assessment adopted the same approach, but that is not what the Bill would require.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill contains measures that attempt to accommodate all the points made by the Minister. It recognises the need for reasonableness and provides defences that can be invoked if necessary. In addition, clause 15 provides that the Secretary of State can make exemptions. I have always been keen that the Secretary of State should not intervene in connection with regulations all over the place, but the Bill needs the provisions of clause 15 to deal with the difficulties and problems that the Minister has described. The Bill does not ignore those difficulties. Instead, it attempts to set in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>221</span>
motion procedures that would accommodate them and clarify the roles of the commission and the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill must be taken as a package. It is right to say that it lists provisions dealing with transport, education, civil rights and other matters. The Minister considers that list of provisions declaratory because it defines all the instances where disabled people need rights. The Bill would put in place mechanisms to provide those rights, but it would not do so in one fell swoop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is one thing to produce legislation that would give rights to disabled people; it is another to make the legislation practical. The Bill would set in operation the necessary procedures, authorities and bodies. A fundamental difference exists between the supporters of this Bill and the Minister. That difference is at the core of the distinction between the two Bills going through the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support my hon. Friend the Minister's approach to providing transport facilities for the disabled. It is not good enough to say—as my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) seems to—that we can include the phrase "failing to remove transport barriers" in the Bill and then provide regulations to make exemptions. Where is the sense in that? There is no sense in it at all. It would be better to get the primary legislation right in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not realistic to expect all providers of transport facilities to modify them to accommodate disabled people. One needs only to consider London underground to realise that that is the case. It would be more sensible to consider what should be done as facilities come on stream to make them accessible to disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what the Minister said about buses. Buses are arguably the most important form of transport for disabled people, and low-floor buses represent a huge step forward. Last year, I visited Wright's factory at Ballymena, which manufactures low-floor buses. Such buses are a good example of a market opportunity for a go-ahead business. The company is well ahead of the competition, and any low-floor bus that one sees in London or elsewhere in England will almost certainly have been manufactured by it. The company exports to the European market, and while I was there, people were visiting from Canada who had an interest in the product. Low-floor buses are a marvellous product, and I am sure that the company will be able to make small low-floor buses in due course. At present, there are difficulties with smaller buses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The approach that I have outlined is the right one; the sledgehammer, American approach is wrong. It simply states that the only exemption for a failure to remove transport barriers is, undue hardship. Under that approach, the sponsor of the Bill is happy to impose due hardship, which is presumably hardship that affects business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingswood did not seem to know what I was talking about when I referred to the leading article in 	<i>The Times,</i> so I shall briefly quote from it. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"America has gone further than Britain on insisting on ramps, lifts and special provision; empowered by similar legislation."</p></blockquote>
—which is a reference to the Government's Bill, not to this Bill—
	<span class='label label-info column'>222</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"American disabled groups have been quick to sue employers and Government for discrimination. Billions of dollars have been spent modifying federal government facilities. But this has been at the cost of an angry backlash. The hugely expensive provision for the disabled is cited as a reason for the soaring cost of government; architects have despaired of the more extravagant demands; and some local authorities have had to close public amenities rather than face lawsuits over the failure to adapt them."</p></blockquote>
That cannot be a sensible way to proceed. It is totally counterproductive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not in a position to provide that evidence, but I shall ensure that I have it before our next sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East and other hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the approach in this Bill is the same.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is interesting, because I certainly do not intend to be cautious in the sense of holding back on the powers that Parliament will be given under the Disability Discrimination Bill. I intend, as does my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport, to ensure that the powers are used to check that all new buses after a certain date are accessible to disabled people. If what the hon. Gentleman proposes is not the same as that, he must be proposing modifications to existing vehicles. I do not think that it is possible to go further than the measures that I am advocating without proposing modifications to existing vehicles. I think that that is what the hon.

	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The approach is entirely different. In connection with the Government legislation and the regulations which come from elsewhere, the Minister can always point in considerable detail to what is being done in various sectors. My measure would set in motion procedures that will begin to fulfil the principles contained in the Bill. By the proposal's nature, I cannot produce great lists of the type that the Minister is always producing to say that this, that and the other will be done. All that I can suggest is the approach that will begin to be adopted. The proposal does not aim to ruin people who run transport facilities by insisting that everything must be adapted overnight, nor does it allow for the same provisions as in the Government regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question is what is the effect—that is the only thing that really matters to all of us and to

	<span class='label label-info column'>223</span>
disabled people. It is either that the effect of the hon. Gentleman's proposal would be different from that of the Government's proposal—in which case the hon. Gentleman must be suggesting that changes should be made to existing vehicles because we intend to tackle new vehicles anyway—or the effect would be the same as that of the Government's proposal. In that case, the proposal represents an extremely convoluted way to go about matters. It says, "Here is a right established in law and now we'll start making everyone exempt from it". That seems to be the approach that we are being told to accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 15 would be used to exempt specific transport providers for long periods from the application of the law. I do not want to exempt people from requirements; I want to place practical requirements on them. I do not want people to be able to put off doing anything year after year or decade after decade; I want to be able to say that from a certain date in the not too distant future, new vehicles must be accessible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend the Minister saying that he has no wish at all—that he thinks that it would be entirely inappropriate—to require owners of existing vehicles to make adaptations to render vehicles accessible to disabled people where they reasonably could do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend will find that to make modifications to an extent sufficient to comply with the legislation is not feasible for the vast majority of vehicles. Much of the work that I have described, such as the work of DPTAC, is already going on and much of it has already borne fruit—relatively easy changes have been made to vehicles. I am not opposed to that at all. The main challenge is to make new vehicles accessible, and the straightforward way to approach that challenge is to give the Government and Parliament the power to order new vehicles to be accessible from a certain date. The hon. Gentleman's method of going about it—by establishing a legal right and then having to work out a complicated range of exemptions, presumably of different lengths and varying conditions—seems an extremely strange way of proceeding. So it is important for us to make clear our concerns about that part of the Bill. However, I have made my point and have made it on other occasions, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 52, in page 9, line 5, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"() Regulations may make provision, for the purposes of this section—
	<ol>
	<li>as to what is to be included within the meaning of 'rules, policies or procedures';</li>

	<li>as to things which are not to be treated as auxiliary aids or services.".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The amendment deals with a topic similar to some of those we have debated, so I shall not labour the point. The amendment would introduce regulation-making powers to define what is meant by "rules, policies or procedures", "architectural" or "communication barriers", and "auxiliary aids and services". My overall purpose in tabling the amendment is to clarify the provisions of part IV, not least so that service providers know precisely what is required of them under the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill contains no guidance as to what will be required under part IV. Clause 12 would have a very great impact on the way service providers run their businesses. Subsection (2)(d) would require service providers to make positive changes to company rules, policies and procedures to accommodate the needs of disabled people. Subsection (2)(f) would oblige service providers to provide auxiliary aids and services where they would afford access to the service for a disabled person. However, those requirements are nowhere properly defined. Instead, it seems that it would be left to the courts to decide whether a particular adjustment was made necessary by the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East will again tell me that the commission will issue codes of practice, but I tell him again that the commission seems to be allowed to take 18 months to do that, and the legislation would come into effect six months after its passage through Parliament. There would be an embarrassing gap after the law has been passed but before there is a code of practice to flesh it out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation-making powers are very important. Without a means of tying down what is meant by "rules, practices and procedures", there would undoubtedly be great uncertainty and difficulties. Some practices will be obviously identifiable: a restaurant proprietor with a sign in his window that reads, "We do not let dogs onto our premises" obviously has a practice that would discriminate against blind people with guide dogs. But what about the local authority that issues its information about the council tax in small print which visually impaired people find it hard to read? Is the choice of print size a "practice" that can discriminate against disabled people? The RNIB and others would certainly insist that it was, but would a court interpret the Bill in that way? The answer is, of course, that we do not know and the Bill does not include a facility that would ensure that the court would see it in the way that I or the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East would want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could quote a myriad of examples to make my point, although it is adequately made by the point I have made. To give one more: a disabled child wishes to join a riding school; she can ride reasonably well but needs, because of her disability, close supervision. Would the school have to, if necessary, provide an additional instructor so that the child could take advantage of the service? Could such an instructor be described as an "auxiliary service"? I do not know the answer—there are probably arguments either way—and neither would the proprietor of the school or the child's parents. We shall have to come up with sensible answers as we implement the Government Bill. We will do that in the light of consultation with those
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0216">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>225</span>
affected and in the knowledge that our Bill provides the necessary powers to make it clear what an auxiliary service or aid would be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How will my hon. Friend be able to issue regulations that can satisfactorily take into account the myriad of differing circumstances of, for example, riding schools? Such schools have different levels of financial resources, different staffing arrangements and different resources of expertise available. How can we regulate to ensure that the required provision is made? Is it not better to leave a sensible degree of flexibility? If there is any acute difficulty, perhaps it should be resolved in a test case by a tribunal or a court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The regulations would have to be quite detailed.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have long viewed the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East as a man of many qualities but not as a great advocate of New Labour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So here we see Opposition Members placing enormous faith in the courts. Without trying to anticipate every situation, Government and Parliament need to do much more to specify our intentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is placing enormous faith—perhaps with some justice—in his officials, who will certainly do their best to design far-seeing regulations that will establish a sensible policy framework for a multitude of different situations. However, it is possible that officials, too, will lack the foresight to get things absolutely right. My hon. Friend knows well that a mass of regulations will not be adequately scrutinised by Parliament. His regulatory approach effectively gives the Government carte blanche to determine how matters will be carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a considered aspect of the strategy of those on this side of the Committee who support the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill to leave more to the judgment of the courts in order to find better ways in practice to resolve the difficulties that we know will arise even though we cannot know their exact nature in advance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do indeed place great faith in my officials, who are a splendid bunch of people. I also place faith in Ministers and in Parliament. I am trying to establish a system that is flexible and which allows for change. In the event that the combined intellectual weight of my officials, Government colleagues and the whole of
	<span class='label label-info column'>226</span>
Parliament gets the regulations wrong, they can be changed. If the courts made a judgment disliked by my hon. Friend or myself or felt not to be what was intended when we debated the Bill, we should have to consider primary legislation again. So it is partly in the interests of flexibility, advocated by my hon. Friend, that I am pursuing this line of argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 52 would allow regulations to be laid so that it was made absolutely clear what compliance with clause 12 would entail. It would allow flexibility so that the Bill's provisions could be clarified in the light of experience of their operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All too often under the Bill, it is left to the courts to decide the responsibilities and obligations of service providers towards their disabled customers. The amendment would ensure that service providers had a clearer idea of what changes needed to be made to certain aspects of their business and premises. I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister might be surprised by a number of things about me. I believe that I have an article in 	<i>Parliamentary Brief</i> which is entitled "New Labour on a new Northern Ireland". It is a reflection, to some extent, of what are supposed to be my views on that matter. Where I fit into the ideological analysis might not be as easy to judge as some people have assumed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a great deal of support in new Labour for the Bill, and it also has its supporters among good old Labour, which has been around for a considerable period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may have to delay adopting various items in the Bill under the exemptions of clause 15 because of specific sets of circumstances. He must do that clearly and openly so that we can see what the regulations are and that they will apply for limited periods. There would be a check on the Minister's activities—a negative regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With amendment after amendment the Minister keeps trying to obtain for himself positive regulatory powers to replace whole sections of the Bill. They would depend on officials and the logic of specific arguments and that would be confining and restrictive for the development of rights for disabled people. In presenting his case the Minister outlined entirely the opposite approach by spelling out where I would stand in relation to those matters. He noted the role of the courts and the commission and made an exaggerated point about the time scale. I do not envisage people rushing into masses of litigation after the adoption of the Bill. The commission will have an advisory and conciliatory role to help people who feel aggrieved, but that will not lead to people being taken to court so that an early interpretation of the Bill can be obtained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a fundamental divide between us, but the Committee has decided, having accepted only a few minor amendments, to go down the Bill's road. The Minister is continuously fighting yesterday's battle. In the spirit of Committee work, he should have accepted by now that he should pursue amendments that are in line with the Bill's framework and principles. Obviously, he opposes the Bill and, given the opportunity that I hope we shall have in the House at a later stage, he will vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not opposed to the Bill's principles, nor are my amendments wrecking amendments. The hon. Gentleman was right to say that we have discussed similar issues before, but I genuinely believe that the adoption of the regulation-making powers which I am advocating would impove the Bill and would give us a much better chance of eliminating discrimination against disabled people. That is why the Government Bill contains such powers. I have made my point and put the Government's view clearly on the record. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 54, in page 9, leave out line 18.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This important amendment concerns education. I should like to consider the proposed inclusion of education in clause 12(3)(f) together with the consequential amendments to education legislation set out in clauses 31 to 34. Some hon. Members seemed to suggest that education could be covered by a Bill of this type. They see it as an important statement about our society's intentions on education for disabled people without altering existing education legislation. Clause 31 provides for existing legislation to be altered. I shall take this opportunity to set out the precise existing measures for which this Bill would create great difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The inclusion of schools in the Bill would necessarily be bound by the simultaneous deletion of the condition in section 160 of the Education Act 1993. In some ways I welcome the opportunity to discuss again the proposed amendment to the 1993 Act. Members of the Committee will recall that I spoke in some detail about it during the Report stage of the Disability Discrimination Bill. One of the central tenets of my argument is that we are in danger of forgetting the wider picture and ignoring the potentially damaging repercussions of the amendments to the 1993 Act. I shall again set out my grave reservations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1993 Act provides comprehensive protection for pupils with learning difficulties or disabilities. Local authorities, in consultation with parents, are responsible for determining the special educational provision required. Where a statement is made in respect of a young person, the authority cannot amend it without informing the young person's parents and giving them an opportunity to make representations. The parents have a right of appeal to the tribunal against any decision to amend or cease to maintain a statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When an authority maintains a statement, it must also arrange for the special educational provision specified in the statement and may, in addition, arrange non-educational provision specified in the statement in such manner as it considers appropriate. An understanding of the legislative context is vital. The 1993 Act carries forward all the principles of the Education Act 1981 and most of its provisions. It was necessary to replace the 1981 Act for a number of reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[MR. ROBIN CORBETT 	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there had been major changes in the broader education field since the early 1980s: the role of
	<span class='label label-info column'>228</span>
authorities was changing; schools were becoming more autonomous as a result of local management of schools as well as grant-maintained status; and parents were becoming increasingly assertive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, while there was general agreement that the 1981 Act represented path-breaking legislation, there was also general agreement that it was not working as well as it should. There were concerns about the time some local authorities took to make assessments and statements; concerns about the consistency of their decisions; and concerns about the provision for children who have special educational needs but who did not have statements. A belief had developed that the only truly effective form of special educational provision was that which was delivered through a statement. That belief was understandable, but had a distorting effect on the system as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a general recognition—not only by the Government but by local authorities, the Audit Commission, voluntary organisations and so on—that change was essential, and that action was necessary to speed up the making of assessments and statements; to clarify the responsibilities of schools and local authorities; to strengthen the involvement of parents in their children's special education; to improve arrangements for making appeals against local authorities' decisions on assessments and; to promote partnership between all concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1993 Act and associated regulations address those concerns. As a result, there is now a new requirement on schools to publish information on their SEN policies for all children with special educational needs, including those without statements. The Committee will be aware that we propose to table an amendment to the Disability Discrimination Bill in the other place which will ensure that those policies include information on steps that need to be taken to ensure that disabled pupils are not discriminated against. There are now time limits on the making of assessments and statements; more rigorous annual reviews of statements; an enhanced voice for parents; a wholly new appeals machinery in the form of the SEN tribunal; and a code of practice, drawing all these elements together and creating a strong and coherent framework for special education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The code provides guidance for schools and authorities, it advises other agencies and it lays a great deal of emphasis on partnership. It was produced in partnership with special needs interests and developed with the help of expert consultants from the voluntary world and experienced administrators, academics and professionals. Some 35,000 copies of the draft code were issued, and people were able to respond. The code was revised and the revised version was laid before Parliament last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The code of practice was warmly received in the House and in the other place. It was welcomed by prominent disability groups, some of whom, in a letter to 	<i>The Times</i> earlier this year, said that it was,
	<br><blockquote><p>"a welcome blueprint which offers a real opportunity to identify and support children with a wide range of learning difficulties and disabilities".</p></blockquote>
That was signed by RNIB, Mencap, Scope, the British Dyslexia Association, the National Deaf Children's Society and others. The Bill, if enacted, would mean that a substantial portion of the code of practice would have to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0218">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>229</span>
be rewritten, in particular the part dealing with the writing of a statement of special educational needs. A completely new edition would be needed. It is a statutory requirement for a revision of the code to include a new draft, consultation on the draft and approval of both Houses. That is a substantial process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill would cast a shadow over what has been a considerable achievement. It would cause immense confusion in the world of special education. The code of practice has gone to every school in the country, and each local authority is even now implementing the new system, helped by cash grants from the Government. They are coordinating the necessary training and ensuring that the new framework for special needs is working efficiently. All that would be put in jeopardy, because this clause and the other clauses that relate to education seek to do away with the carefully balanced provisions of the existing legislation. That would undermine the role of education authorities working with parents to plan the best education for their children. The current statutory system provides the most appropriate provision for pupils and students while ensuring the most efficient use of resources. That balance was achieved as a result of much debate as the recent legislation on schools and on further and higher education went through Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause seems to envisage a world in which there are no cost limits because I do not accept that the test of "undue hardship" will have any real force when it comes to local authorities. What is undue hardship for local authorities? At the moment they are able to plan for the best provision and often choose to do so by focusing their efforts on adapting particular, strategically placed schools. It would be wrong for them to have to spread their resources inefficiently as a result of a lack of planning imposed by having to make adaptations piecemeal. That would be the precise result of these proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may help if I provide an illustration of the sort of adaptation that might be needed in a typical secondary school. Such a school would be likely to need external ramps, as well as internal ramps and possibly stair lifts. It may be necessary to build a lift, which could be fire proofed, as well as an alternative means of escape. But it is not just a question of getting children into the school. Once there, adaptations need to be made to enable them to gain full access to the national curriculum, such as work-benches and sinks for pupils with locomotive disabilities, as well as providing therapy rooms. The costs are not just physical; staff training is also necessary. Taken together, those costs may be considerable—perhaps as much as £750,000 for a typical two-storey secondary school. Local education authorities can currently plan strategically for adaptations like that, taking into account parental preference in their areas. During Report on the Disability Discrimination Bill I announced the setting up of new funds so that education providers could obtain additional funding for imaginative projects that helped to increase the accessibility of schools. The Coopers and Lybrand report "Within Reach" estimated that the average secondary school would cost £325,000 to render fully accessible. That figure represents only the core cost of physical adaptation to the building and does not include staffing, equipment or emergency escape provisions. Coopers and Lybrand concluded that to render all schools accessible would cost a total of £1.7 billion.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
However worthy an objective that might be, it was agreed during consideration of the Disability Discrimination Bill that the money was not available. The hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) is not with us today; if he were, he would be able to corroborate the fact that he said then that no timetable could be set for providing that amount of money and that his party could not contemplate providing it in the near future, even though it wanted progress to me made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I welcome you back to the Chair, Mr. Hogg. Your return has had the fortunate side effect of allowing the Committee to proceed. Your absence devastated our proceedings, and they had to be brought to a halt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was arguing that a provision is being included in the Bill that cannot realistically be implemented. That smacks of making a declaratory statement without there being the wherewithall to back it up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman's</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>attention having been called to the fact that six Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room and six Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are happy to see the hon. Member for Kingswood again, and he seems much happier having taken that break. I was arguing that the Bill would mean implementing measures even though people are not prepared to come up with the means to do so. That would damage provisions already in place to improve access to education for disabled children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East should consider the effect that the Bill would have in its current form on primary school provision. The 1993 Coopers and Lybrand survey again gave us some useful information. It found that the cost of adapting an average primary school is much less than that of adapting a secondary school, since buildings are usually smaller, with fewer entrances and often only a single storey. Much of the cost of such adaptations would go in providing disabled toilet facilities. However, the report estimated that it would cost, on average, about £20,000 for physical access to a typical primary school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be noted that that covers only access to the building. Provision for the full national curriculum is likely to be more expensive. It is clear that the provision of such facilities needs careful strategic planning. It will not be possible to adapt all schools simultaneously. It would be counterproductive and ineffective partially to adapt a large number of schools; it would be better to ensure that there is a growing core of schools that are fully adapted for use by disabled children. Any other approach would waste resources and result in inadequate facilities of little real use to disabled pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0219">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>231</span>
In my constituency in north Yorkshire, many schools are not accessible to disabled children. However, a few months ago I visited one secondary school which is accessible and attended by a significant number of disabled children. They are able to participate fully in the national curriculum because the resources available in the area have been concentrated on that school. If the same resources had been spent in penny packets around all the schools in the area, there would be no school that was fully accessible to and usable by disabled children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many authorities are making strides already in providing full facilities in some mainstream primary and secondary schools, using their capital allocations and capital receipts to good effect. We shall augment that process with our new scheme to elicit imaginative proposals to improve access for disabled pupils. The access survey of school accommodation to be provided later in the year will also be relevant to the achievement of systematic improvements in access. Section 160 of the 1993 Act not only includes a condition relating to the efficient use of resources; a second condition requires that a child's education in a school that is not a special school should not be incompatible with the provisions of efficient education for the children with whom he or she will be educated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my speech during the Report stage debate, I referred to children with emotional and behavioural difficulties. I do not believe that it was intended that this Bill would foster the systematic disruption, by children with special educational needs such as emotional and behavioural difficulties, of the education of the rest of the class. However, that is exactly what could happen if the condition set out in section 160 of the 1993 Act were removed, as is the intention of this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, what I have said about the schools sector and children with special educational needs refers to the statutory provisions in England and Wales. Different legislative provisions apply in Scotland, but the broad effects are the same. The implications of the Bill's proposals are also similar. Therefore, there is an important case to be made in respect of education. All hon. Members want more mainstream schools to become accessible to disabled children. A number of measures are already in effect or about to take effect, and they will greatly assist that process. However, this Bill, in pursuing what comes across as a rather dogmatic approach to the problem, threatens to override or remove the carefully structured provisions of the Education Act 1993. Those provisions are very popular among those who work with children with disabilities. So far, they have worked well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A parallel argument can be made about further and higher education and the risk of dissipating the available resources in those sectors. The Government plan to table amendments, which will refer to further and higher education, to the Government Bill in another place. Again, it is important to have a strategic approach and to concentrate on ensuring that we make education genuinely and fully accessible to disabled students right across the board, rather than making token efforts. We need practical measures. We could go a long way during the next few years with such measures, from which the Bill before us seems quite a good distance. It would be better for the Bill and for many disabled children were we to accept the amendments that I am advocating and
	<span class='label label-info column'>232</span>
proceed as I suggested during debates on the Disability Discrimination Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The importance of education is such that if legislation could apply only to one specific sector, I would choose the education sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education begins early, at the start of a person's life. The sharing between disabled and able-bodied people, with the disabled being able to participate as fully as they can in educational opportunities, seems to me to be of massive importance. I realise that the Minister might not dispute that greatly, but he might argue that there are different ways of achieving that objective. However, in terms of the self-fulfilment of the individual, of beginning to develop skills and technologies to play a role in the economy, and of participating in democratic processes, children being involved together is of massive importance. Of course, we are not just discussing children; we are discussing further educational provisions too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, the Minister's track record on educational issues is not good. Although amendments are being made in another place, the Bill that he initially introduced contained about 14 exemptions. Any body funded by all sorts of educational funding organisations was initially excluded from the Bill's provisions. When the list was examined, it was difficult to find any type of educational institution to which the Minister's measure would have applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Matters have moved along since then. Perhaps the very existence of this Bill and pressures from outside have helped the Minister to adjust his attitude somewhat but he still adopts a limited approach. That exaggerates the problems that he envisages being created by the Bill. The Bill still includes the exemptions provision in clause 15, and there is an opportunity to use that to have discussions with local authorities and other providers to ensure that there are programmes for practical developments to improve access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clauses 31 and 32 deal with the right of a child to be involved in mainstream education. They are not about access to every conceivable school in every conceivable place all at once. We are talking about the provisions that were debated previously and the gradual development of the principles of the Bill. The Bill includes a dynamic process, so that its important principles can be put into operation in practical ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman speaks about the right to be included in mainstream education. Does he see that as an absolute right, so that anyone seeking it, or a parent seeking it on his behalf, could have it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about rights as they are generally contained in the Bill. We are talking about qualified disabled people for whom that avenue of education is appropriate. The obstacles that often stand in their way are practical ones and can begin to be removed. So those rights—like all rights—are not divorced from the world; obviously there are circumstances in which because of the severity of the disability involved, special school provision—of the kind that has already been developed—will be required. Parents will in many cases see that as appropriate for their children. However, it is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0220">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>233</span>
vastly frustrating to many parents that their children cannot participate in general education, although they are capable of doing so, because of the problems associated with the school buildings, organisation and curricula. It might be the lack of assistance provided for children who are dyslexic, for example. Often, the provision of special education institutions offers a way out of the problem rather than a resolution of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could produce details of the organisations involved in education which support the Bill, especially its educational provisions, but my hope, as always, is that we will make progress with the Bill and we therefore need to concentrate on our differences of principle. The sort of provisions in past Education Acts, such as the 1981 Act, that should have been helping disabled children are not being put into effect. That should be taken into account in a key piece of legislation which deals with civil rights for disabled people. So far from that area being, as the Minister says—he has made lengthy and detailed contributions on that today—problematic, it is fundamental that provisions dealing with education are contained in the Bill and are not sidelined into other provisions that the Minister has to draw up. However, I accept that there is a place for advancing the practical negotiations and discussions, as contained in clause 15, in the light of the other forces contained in the Bill that we have frequently discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I at least agree with the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East that it is a fundamentally important issue. That is why I have dealt with it in some detail today. It is important to ensure that education becomes more accessible to disabled children. The hon. Gentleman was unfair to the people who have made progress on that so far when he claimed that changes were not happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider statements. I speak from memory, but I believe that two thirds of recent statements specify mainstream schools. That is a great improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the hon. Gentleman's reply to my question about whether the provision established an absolute right. His answer was no. He mentioned the concept of qualified disabled person. I presume that that means that some disabled children will be deemed not qualified to receive education in a mainstream school. I am not sure that courts would interpret "qualified" in that way. It is interesting that the hon. Gentleman relies on that concept for those regrettable instances when it is not possible to be fair to other children and at the same time to include a particular child who suffers from severe emotional or behavioural difficulties in a mainstream school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman accepts that one cannot establish an absolute right, we agree. But if he accepts that point, why does he wish to repeal key parts of section 160 of the Education Act 1993? That legislation provides balance, by ensuring that factors to be taken into account include the wishes of parents, the educational needs of other children and available resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is heightened mystery about the reasons for trying to repeal some provisions of the 1993 Act. I am not sure whether all the people who are involved in education and who, according to the hon. Gentleman, support the civil rights concept, are aware of the Bill's intention to
	<span class='label label-info column'>234</span>
repeal a key part of the 1993 Act. That section has led to considerable progress for disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has not reassured me about resources—one of the factors to be taken into account under section 160 of the 1993 Act. Resources are limited. They should be made available, but it will not be possible in a period of months, or even a few years, for a Government to undertake the sort of expenditure about which I spoke earlier to ensure that all mainstream schools are accessible. The strategic approach is the only sensible method of proceeding. Yet the Bill attacks the section of the 1993 Act that encourages and permits education authorities to adopt that approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am gravely unhappy about the approach that has been outlined, although I am grateful for clarification on one or two points. I wish to consider the matter again later. But to assist our continuing speedy progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 56, in page 9, leave out line 23.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall speak more briefly than I did on the previous amendment. Clause 12(3)(j) stipulates that it is unlawful to discriminate against a disabled person in relation to the membership of associations, clubs or other organisations. This example goes much further than the general provision of goods, facilities and services to the public as set out in clause 12 which, I remind members of the Committee, refers to the provision of goods, facilities and services to the public or any section of the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some clubs, such as private golf clubs, provide a service to the public at certain times, but at all other times are open only to members—for example, by allowing a function room to be used by any member of the public who makes a booking. Other clubs never provide a service to members of the public. Those clubs should not therefore be covered by anti-discrimination legislation. The question is when is a club or association providing a service to members of the public? If someone becomes a member of a club or association, pays fees and agrees to abide by the club's rules, is he or she receiving a service? If so, is he receiving it because he is a member of the club and not a member of the public?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a fundamental point here about the proper role of Government. Should a Government have the power to inspect and intervene in all aspects of people's lives, or should they recognise that they have no role in interfering with what people regard as their own business? The matter is fraught with difficulty and lines have to be drawn somewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government would not wish to get involved in the business and rules of every private club in the country or to take decisions about what clubs can and cannot do. There would be an outcry if we did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it right for the state to interfere in the ways in which citizens gather in private? That is what this Bill appears to suggest, although I am not convinced that it would be achieved, as clause 12 clearly relates to services to the public. Provided their activities are legal and do not harm other people, I would be loth to tamper with what private clubs and societies do, even when I might not understand their attraction or agree with their aims or attitudes. The Government must set a boundary beyond which they do
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0221">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>235</span>
not trespass in the regulation of the private citizen. This part of the clause crosses that line and risks turning private individuals against measures of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no definition within the Bill of the term "other organisations" that is used in the example. I assume that the term means any organisation of which someone can become a member. There is no mention of a service being provided to members of the public and it would appear that that is also too wide a term to be used effectively when attempting to illustrate the sorts of service providers to whom the Bill applies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those strong reservations about the clause, I commend my amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that groups of citizens in private should be free to act unless what they do is illegal. We are considering altering the law; thus discrimination would be covered by the category to which the Minister refers. It cannot be the case that people meeting together can do as they wish, as there are legal provisions which affect their behaviour.
