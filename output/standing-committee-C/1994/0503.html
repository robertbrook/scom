<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to move amendment No. 6 and, in so doing, to welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Maxton. I hope that you will enjoy your tenure, as did Mr. Hogg last week.<br><br>
This large group of amendments relates to the Bill's concept of a qualified disabled person in part III, which deals with employment. The amendments would remove the concept of a "qualified" disabled person from the Bill's employment provisions. Like new clause 3, it reflects a fundamental difference between the approach that the Bill takes on the issue of discrimination in employment and the approach that the Government favour.<br><br>
In the Bill as currently drafted, an employer's only justification for discrimination would be that the person
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 102</span>
could not perform the essential functions of a job. This concept has been borrowed from the Americans with Disabilities Act's "qualified individuals with disability". The ADA further defines this as
<br><blockquote><p>"an individual with a disability who meets the skills, education, and other job-related requirements of a position held or desired, and who, with or without reasonable accommodation can perform the essential functions of the job".</p></blockquote>
To be protected by the ADA, a person must not only be an individual with a disability but must also be "qualified". An employer is not required to hire or retain an individual who is not qualified to perform the job.<br><br>
The Bill gives us no insight into what an "essential function" of a job might be. It is not clear how the Bill's sponsors would establish what could be an essential function if cases were taken to industrial tribunals and the terminology were argued over. I assume that the thinking behind the clause is that an employer might deliberately add spurious marginal duties to a job specification, and then argue that a disabled employee was unable to perform these duties and so should be dismissed or not taken on.<br><br>
I agree that the issue of performance of marginal duties needs to be addressed. However, the provision to do so already exists within the Bill. An employer must consider the duty to make reasonable adjustment. If an employee cannot perform certain duties and these are marginal duties, it may well not be reasonable to require him or her to do them, and they can be dropped or reassigned in line with the reasonable adjustment provision.<br><br>
In the Disability Discrimination Bill—the Government's Bill—employees and applicants are protected in a much simpler way. The Government Bill recognises that there are a number of circumstances in which an employer may have good reason to treat a disabled person less favourably. One such circumstance is where the disabled person is unsuitable for the employment. Another is where the disabled person is less suitable than the person who is given the employment; or where me nature of the disabled person's disability significantly impedes, or would significantly impede, the performance of any of his duties. However, an employer must first consider the duty to make a reasonable adjustment. That could mean reassigning marginal duties to another employee.<br><br>
That framework, as I have described it, is much easier to work in practice. We are trying to achieve the same thing—in the Disability Discrimination Bill and the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill—especially in respect of employment. However, the Bill is creating too complicated a system, which will give rise to grave doubts about what essential functions may be. The concept of qualified disabled persons is seeking to create a class of people who could be equated, for example, with an ethnic group in race relations legislation. In this context, that is a complex and ambiguous concept. The framework set out in the Government's Bill is a fairer and more satisfactory way to proceed, and that is why I want to highlight this issue through the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister correctly points out that there is a major difference between the Bill and the Government's approach, and the term "qualified" shows that. He also points out that new clause 3 is in the background. If this batch of amendments were accepted and new clause 3
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0149">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 103</span>
were not, a huge void would be created, and that would make a mockery of the Bill. The Government have suggested new clause 3 as an alternative avenue, and, although we are not discussing it, we must pay some attention to it.<br><br>
The term "qualified" is important because it relates to the term "reasonable", which is often used to define the actions that are expected of an employer. Although many grounds will be used to establish reasonableness, including the cost of adaptations that an employer is called on to make, the definition of a qualified disabled person will be particularly important and will be important to the courts and to an employer's understanding of his position.<br><br>
The Minister always uses the tactic of getting me to elaborate at length on certain details. He now wants me to elaborate on what the essential function of a job is and why pages of the Bill are not devoted to describing it. Jobs are numerous, however, and a massive problem would be involved in including the whole list of different functions that must be engaged in. It is better, therefore, to include a principle in the Bill, although it must be clear and reasonable.<br><br>
The rest of the Bill makes it clear that the role of the Disability Rights Commission in looking at difficulties as they arise and creating its own definitions and codes of practice—powers which the Minister has sought to take for himself in other amendments—is quite sensible. Again, that touches on the difference between this Bill and the Government Bill.<br><br>
The Government now have their Bill and the House has examined it—it is in another place at the moment. A case can, however, be made for an alternative, which has had considerable support. That alternative is based on clear principles, such as the role of the commission and the definition of a qualified disabled person. That alternative approach is clear from the definition, and it is spread throughout the sections of the Bill that refer to employment.<br><br>
The matter comes up again with regard to amendment No. 34, which is in the next group of amendments to be debated. It would extend the same principles to the provision of goods and services. I assume that the same argument will develop between the Minister and us. In a sense, in deciding on a position now, we are shaping up our position on the next group of amendments, since one element of the Bill relates to the other.<br><br>
We want to develop the notion that the fact of disability should not be used to discriminate against people, although—obviously—some people are not going to be able to perform certain functions and jobs because of their disability. The term "qualified" will allow for that. We are not talking about telephonists who are deaf—unless the technology changes considerably—or about blind bus drivers.<br><br>
The term "qualified" should cover the matter adequately for the courts when they determine cases of alleged discrimination. We must also remember that, in the light of the Disability Rights Commission's role of operating conciliation procedures, it would help to prevent the masses of litigation that would otherwise arise from the provisions. The Bill's approach, therefore, is not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 104</span>
only different from, but superior to, that of the Government Bill.<br><br>
The Government want to provide for the disabled who have chronic illnesses which can be defined specifically and in detail. We want our Bill to be broader and to be directed towards the discriminator rather than always to the precise condition in which the disabled person finds him or herself—although the disability may, on occasion, be such that it prevents a function from being performed. We want the Bill to cover that eventuality, too, and we think that our proposal, rather than the Minister's suggestion, fits in with the other principles in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Berry <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kingswood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Maxton.<br><br>
I am surprised that the Minister is unhappy with the concept of a "qualified disabled person". It simply acknowledges that of course it is possible for an employer not to employ a disabled person—there is no debate about the fact that there are circumstances in which a disabled person cannot perform the essential functions of a job. It seems to me that the purpose of that term is to make the important point that if someone cannot fulfil the essential functions of a job, there can be no question of discrimination. I would have thought that it would be helpful for that simple point to be at the heart of the clause that deals with definition.<br><br>
The next problem is what we mean by the essential functions of a job and what we mean by reasonable accommodation. The Minister is right to imply that, although it gives specific guidance on matters that would need to be considered to arrive at a reasonable interpretation of the word "reasonable", the Bill does not detail the essential functions of each and every job. Sensible people would think those details have been left out because that matter should be dealt with by, for example, codes of practice.<br><br>
The term "qualified disabled person", as the Minister said, draws on the ADA, where I gather that it has caused no problems. The use of that term makes it clear upfront that we are not saying that it would be wrong for an employer not to employ a person who cannot do the job.<br><br>
The term "discrimination" is another example of how words are used differently. There are a number of fundamental differences between this Bill and the Government Bill. I shall not digress by describing them, but there is no doubt that the Minister's use of the term "discrimination" differs from the way it is used in this Bill.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
The Minister has repeated this morning his previous assertion that it amounts to discrimination if an employer chooses to appoint a non-disabled person to a post in preference to a disabled person because the non-disabled person is the better candidate. But we should not dream of using the term "discrimination" if we were talking about women losing out on the grounds of gender or about black people on the grounds of race. We could call such treatment on the grounds of gender or race discrimination only if it were unfair.<br><br>
I approach discrimination against disabled people in the same way. The Minister's implication that the Bill would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0150">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 105</span>
prevent employers from appointing the best candidate for a job is fundamentally wrong. We are using the word "discrimination" in two different ways. We need to be clear about that so that we do not continue to talk past each other.<br><br>
The Minister has used the term "discrimination" to describe what happens when an employer takes on a non-disabled person in preference to a disabled person, even if that non-disabled person is clearly the person best qualified for the job. I do not regard that as discrimination, and neither do supporters of the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill. We understand discrimination against disabled people in the same way as we understood the discrimination that was made illegal under the race and sex legislation. That is, that unfair treatment of a person on the grounds of sex, race or disability amounts to discrimination.<br><br>
We have spent a lot of time talking about discrimination in the two ways that I have described, and we should not spend too much more time on it. However, it is worth noting that a recognition that we are using the word differently will help each side appreciate the other's point of view. I used to think that nothing stands or falls on a definition, but the Minister's use of the term "discrimination" in this context is curious. It is inconsistent with the way the term is used in other antidiscrimination legislation, but a recognition of the different usages at least will render further debate unnecessary.<br><br>
Finally, the purpose of the Bill's use of the concept of "qualified disabled person" is not to make life difficult or to cloud the issue. It is to clarify that there is no intention, under the employment provisions in part III, that a disabled person who cannot do a job when reasonable accommodation is provided should be able to use the Bill as an argument for protection. Such a person is not being unfairly discriminated against if a qualified non-disabled person is appointed instead. The Minister ought to appreciate that the use of the term is intended to be helpful in clarifying the Bill's aim. The amendment just serves to confuse matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to have missed the first few words of the Minister's speech, and I should like to pay tribute to the hon. Member for Kingswood (Mr. Berry), who has just spoken. A serious Committee stage is important because it exposes hon. Members who speak across each other or in ways that do not come together. Whether or not the Bill has any prospect of further progress, this debate could be useful for the future. It could also be of significant advantage to people who are trying to help and to those who suffer discrimination, of which there are two varieties—the discrimination that arises when people do not recognise others' capabilities, and the discrimination that arises when people choose not to remove barriers that ought to be removed. That is one of the reasons why I welcome the change of title in the Department of Transport from the disability unit to the mobility unit—that concentrates on what people can do, rather than focusing on the things which it appears they cannot do. It is a simple change, but a positive step forward.<br><br>
It might be possible to approach the matter in a different manner in the Bill, or in a successor Bill. There could be a clause stating that nothing in the Bill would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
discriminate by giving some people a better chance of a job for which they are not best qualified. That would remove the necessity of having the word "qualified" in virtually every clause of the Bill except the one relating to polling stations.<br><br>
It should be possible to agree an acceptable way forward when, after the speeches that we have already heard and the ones still to come, hon. Members on each side of the Committee understand what the other side is trying to achieve in terms of wording. The hon. Member for Kingswood (Mr. Berry) is right that definitions can be important. There is a general understanding that positive action is needed to overcome barriers, whether in the employer's mind or physical. We are not trying to achieve a mirror image of what currently happens, which is that people get jobs although they are less well qualified for them than people with disabilities. That may be because of prejudice or habit or convenience, but no one suggests that to redress that imbalance—which is unfair and wrong—we should discriminate the other way around. We are trying to let people use their talents and let their qualifications show. Those should be what matter rather than points of apparent, or even significant difference.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Minister raised a significant point. When members of the Committee consider the issues, they will understand that there needs to be a choice of how to achieve non-controversial aims and that we are trying to take positive action rather than go for positive discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: There cannot possibly be any difference in the use of the "discrimination" in this Bill, the Government Bill and equal opportunities and race relations legislation. The word is well understood. In cases of employment, if there are two people, one of whom is clearly better qualified for the job than the other, and the employer decides not to choose that person because he or she is disabled—or on grounds of sex or race—that is discrimination. Discrimination means making an unfair, unreasonable or arbitrary decision. I do not think that there is any difficulty with that definition. It seems that everyone has the same objective—to prevent discrimination from happening. That is the object of the exercise.<br><br>
I am not very clear from the debate what the practical consequences would be for disabled people under the Government Bill and in the Bill that we are debating. The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East said that his approach was superior, but we would expect him to say that. I understand that, but I have been unable to detect what the practical consequences would be for disabled people or for employers. If my hon. Friend the Minister or the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East could cast some light on that, I would find it very helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris <span class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester, Wythenshawe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to see you in the Chair, Mr. Maxton, and to welcome you to our proceedings.<br><br>
I agree with the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood. He will recall that we had this debate before, not least when this Bill was his Bill in the previous parliamentary Session.<br><br>
I think that it sometimes helps to talk in terms of practice, as well as in terms of precept. As the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) spoke, I recalled a case referred to me by a severely disabled person who
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0151">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 107</span>
was, at the same time, extremely able. He told me—and he can document his case—that his prospective employer has insisted that it was essential that the successful candidate be able to drive. Because he was unable to drive, he was turned down—he was what is called a disabled passenger. On inquiry, it was shown that previous holders of the position had never been called on to drive and that the person who got the job after my correspondent was turned down had never been required to drive. That is not an isolated case. My correspondent felt that a trumped up reason had been given for discriminating against him on the grounds of disability. The more we listen to the experiences of disabled people, the better it will be for us as legislators.<br><br>
The Bill is very much an essay on the practical problems experienced by disabled people who wrote and spoke about discrimination against them some years ago when the Bill was drafted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been a useful exchange of views. There is much agreement about our objectives in framing legislation—the sort of objectives that my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) has spoken of. The right hon. Member for Manchester, Wythenshawe (Mr. Morris) has reminded us that we are trying to solve practical problems and deal with practical situations. Indeed, that is my concern about the way in which parts of the Bill, including this clause, are constructed. The speech of the hon. Member for Kingswood was the most useful because he identified some important differences in our approach; I think that he will agree it is not a matter of a difference of objective. He and the Bill's sponsor are trying to prevent discrimination in the sense in which he defined discrimination. I accept that he is not trying to create the situation of an employer having to take someone on if that person cannot do the job. I support that and share that objective.<br><br>
However, notwithstanding our discussion, I have several remaining concerns. First, how are we to define, at a later stage, the essential functions of a job? I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East that we would not want or be able to incorporate all such definitions in the Bill. That is not what I am suggesting. However, the hon. Gentleman displays enormous faith that the commission that he proposes to establish will come up with guidance and codes of practice which would clarify such matters. He also places much faith in the courts which would not be bound by those codes of practice and that guidance. He expressed the hope that we would avoid a great deal of litigation, but I wonder whether a term such as "essential functions" invites litigation. On my visit to Washington, to study the effects of anti-discrimination legislation and to see how the ADA is working, I was told of considerable worries among American employers about the concept of essential requirements for the job—the mirror of the provision in the Bill. Some American lawyers are advising employers not to have detailed job descriptions so that, by not having anything that people could describe as the essential functions or requirements of the job, they can avoid legal difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Even though the Government Bill does not use the term, is not it the case that any form of antidiscrimination legislation relating to employment will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 108</span>
require some mechanism for determining the essential functions—for want of a better phrase—of the job? No doubt under the Government Bill a disabled person will not be able to claim that he or she has been discriminated against if, in some sense, that person cannot carry out the essential functions of the job. I appreciate that the Minister may not like that phrase, but does not any form of anti-discrimination legislation relating to employment involve some notion of what is required and what is not?</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not quite. As the hon. Gentleman will recall, the Government take a different approach in their Bill, and that approach is taken in new clause 3, which I have tabled for discussion in the Committee. The conditions that we have set out would provide that an employer would be justified in discriminating against a disabled person only if that person were unsuitable for that employment or less suitable than someone else, or the nature of the disability would impede the performance of his duties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not quite: there is an important difference. People may be able to perform the essential functions of a job, but an employer may be perfectly justified in saying that he does not want to employ them because they are not the most suitable people. We all do that. We may interview a large number of people for a job, all of whom can do its essential functions but we have to treat some of them less favourably. That is the problem that the Bill does not solve.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the phraseology in new clause 3 and in the Government Bill as open to the question, "What does this really mean?" as the phraseology in this Bill?<br><br>
The Minister again fell back on the term "discrimination" but not in the context of treating someone unfairly. He suggested that a disabled person would be discriminated against if he did not get the job because he was not the best candidate. Does he accept our assurance that that is not how we are using the word "discrimination"? We are using it as it is used in the race relations and sex discrimination legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's assurance. He is right to point out the difference, but I am using the term "discrimination" in its literal sense. I note that my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield agrees with the hon. Gentleman: we are all at liberty to agree or disagree with each other. I use the term "discrimination" in its literal sense because of the serious possibility and danger that the courts will do the same.<br><br>
On the hon. Gentleman's first point about openness, the Government Bill leaves questions open because the same problem arises. As the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East rightly said, we cannot put everything in the Bill. Rather than farm this matter out to a commission to issue subsequent codes of practice, the Government Bill is accompanied by regulation-making powers that will have legal force.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although the Government Bill is relevant to our discussions, it is not directly related to this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0152">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 109</span>
measure. The wording in new clause 3 that we must examine may have been taken from the Government Bill. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"the disabled person is unsuitable for the employment … the disabled person is less suitable for the employment than another person".</p></blockquote>
Those phrases are problematic because the Minister is seeking to impose qualifying conditions that would require interpretation by the courts or a body that provides codes of practice. The Minister has already lost a motion that was seeking to do that in respect of life activities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not quite get the significance of the hon. Gentleman's final point. But he is right that the Government's approach in new clause 3 would require codes of practice and regulations. That approach is, however, more comprehensive, more closely related to what actually happens in such situations and covers them more fairly than does the approach in clause 1.<br><br>
Those remain my concerns about this element of the Bill. We shall return to many of the same questions on the next group of amendments and in our consideration of clause 4. I shall therefore not detain the Committee further on this issue. The amendments have, however, highlighted some of the differences in approaches to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Minister one question because I fear that it might come back to haunt us. Is the Minister satisfied that he is using the term "discrimination" in the same way as it is used in sex and race discrimination legislation? I am not convinced that he is doing so; if that is the case, we shall face grave problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the way I use it is in line with general usage. I shall be happy to offer further thoughts on the matter at a later stage. The hon. Gentleman perhaps also refers to what I want to achieve, and I am sure that we can readily agree about that. The use of the word "discrimination" does, however, differ in the two Bills, I beg—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I intervene again on the matter of essential elements? When I was an assistant Minister at the Department of Employment, I tried to find out why, even though women made up 80 per cent. of first line managers and executive officers, they only made up 40 per cent. of managers two grades higher. The answer involved many factors. One of them concerned the important job of working in Ministers' private offices and advising Ministers on policy. There appeared to be an assumption that civil servants had to be available all hours of the day and night so that, if the Minister was in Parliament, they could be there as well. I asked when Ministers had last been questioned about that practice and whether job sharing or allowing someone to work part time would be equally good alternatives. Many people who do policy work are, in any case, often somewhere else. That issue impressed on me the fact that defining essential elements is a cultural issue and not only a matter of job fulfilment. That takes us back to the point made by the right hon. Member for Wythenshawe about the essential car driver.<br><br>
The issue of definitions is difficult, and I confess that I am not completely clear about whether we are dealing here with different uses of the word "discrimination", as
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 110</span>
the hon. Member for Kingswood suggested. Our debate demonstrates why it is better in contentious areas for campaigning groups to get together with a Minister or Ministers to agree a way forward. The aims and ambitions behind the Government Bill clearly coincide with many of those behind this Bill. As it is, however, we have got into unnecessary rows in the past two or three years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, my hon. Friend makes some valid points. I shall, however, try to get to the end of my sentence, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Maxton.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In many ways the amendments parallel those we have just discussed. Their purpose is to remove the concept of a qualified disabled person with regard to the provision of goods, facilities and services. The amendments remove references to that concept in part IV of the Bill. The Bill defines a qualified disabled person for those purposes as a disabled person who meets the "essential requirements" for the receipt of goods or services with or without a reasonable modification to rules, policies or practices, or the removal of architectural, communication or transport barriers. Therefore, a service provider's only justification for discrimination would be that the person would not meet the essential requirements. I should point out that the Bill does not define what is meant by "essential requirements", just as it does not define what is meant by "essential functions". The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East will say that the definition will have to be made at a later stage, but I am
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0153">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 111</span>
anxious that it would be left to the courts to determine. I have mentioned that problem before.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend anxious that the definition should be left to the courts, or that it should not be left to the courts?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am worried that what constitutes an essential requirement would be left to the courts to define. That would not be satisfactory.<br><br>
The concept of "qualified disabled person" is seeking to create for the purposes of the Bill a class of people which can be equated with, for example, membership of an ethnic group in race relations legislation. I believe that that approach is flawed for two reasons.<br><br>
First, the Bill attempts to focus on the group characteristics of disabled people. I do not believe that that is appropriate, given the immense diversity of the individual characteristics of people with disabilities. The Disability Discrimination Bill takes a more individualistic approach, which will be more effective in ensuring that disabled people are protected by legislation. Our preferred approach would leave the disabled person, unambiguously, as the person with the rights under the Bill.<br><br>
Secondly, I have a fundamental, practical objection to the concept of "qualified disabled person". I would expect service providers to face great difficulty in determining whether a disabled person was "qualified" to receive a service. The concept is more difficult in that context man in the context of employment. Like many other of the Bill's provisions, the concept is vague and undefined. It will not help service providers to understand their duties in real, everyday commercial transactions with disabled customers. It is vital that service providers are clear about their responsibilities under the legislation if they are to comply with its requirements. Without clarity and the cooperation of service providers, the legislation cannot work as intended.<br><br>
I am unsure, for example, what would be the effect of the reference to "essential requirement" in service provision. Would it allow traders to refuse to serve a disabled person if that person's disability would lead to a threat to the health or safety of other consumers? Would service providers be able to refuse service to a disabled person who was unable to enter into an enforceable agreement? We debated that question when we considered the Disability Discrimination Bill. Could a trader refuse service to a disabled person where that was essential to provide the service to others? How could we be sure that the courts would interpret the "essential requirements" provisions as covering the need to serve other customers?<br><br>
It may help the Committee if I give an example of what I mean. Opposition Members make much of the inclusion of education in the Bill, and we shall come to that later. For the moment, I want to focus on those schools that require prospective students to pass an entrance test.</span></p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN'S <i>attention having been called to the fact that six Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room and six Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 112</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: After that brief interruption, I shall resume.<br><br>
I was asking the Committee to focus on the question of prospective students being required to pass an entrance test. Some children may not be able to meet the required standard because of their disability. The question must be asked: does the Bill require those schools to drop or to modify their entrance examinations so that all disabled children are potentially capable of passing them?<br><br>
There are two possible answers. The first is to say that no student should be excluded from any school on account of disability, whatever that might be. If that meant the end of schools that had entrance examinations, so be it. Some people might intend that very result.<br><br>
The alternative reply—which I suspect the Bill's sponsors would give me—is to say that the use of academic tests as part of the admission process would still be possible. A pupil who failed an entrance test—albeit given appropriate special facilities—would not meet an essential requirement for the service that was provided by the school, so he or she would not be a qualified disabled person.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
That sounds neat, but would it work? It would solve the problem, provided that the courts agreed that an entrance test is an essential requirement of the service that was offered by the school in question. But can we be confident that the courts would take that view? They might accept the contrary argument and rule that the essential requirement for a pupil is that he or she should be able to benefit from the lessons provided by the school and that if those lessons could reasonably be modified to benefit students who failed the entrance test, they should be adapted accordingly. The courts may be further impelled towards that view by the fact that other schools do not have entrance tests which measure aptitude.<br><br>
I freely concede that I do not know on which side a court would come down on that question. The point that I want to make is that the sponsors of the Bill cannot know that, either. Of course, they can argue that elucidation of the Bill's intentions could be given in a code of practice, but that would not be legally binding on the courts. Nor would it give the degree of confidence needed when so much could be at stake.<br><br>
I would be grateful for any enlightenment that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East or other members of the Committee could give as to how those problems might be resolved. The amendment, in removing the problematic concept of "qualified disabled person" where it relates to essential requirements, would go some way towards giving the Bill greater clarity and ensuring that there is a right of access for those on whom the burden of compliance will fall—ordinary service providers and traders. I hope that the Committee will consider the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been helpful to the Committee by illustrating some of the questions that are raised by the definition of a qualified disabled person and the question of whether the courts would have a free hand or whether they would be guided. However tight a definition is, or however well understood, the courts can always get involved—via a public authority's judicial review, for example, but in other ways as well.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0154">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 113</span>
The Minister made a significant distinction between someone's right to challenge the way in which a service is being provided and the fear that someone who traditionally provides a service may be challenged by some kind of class action and have their role fundamentally changed.<br><br>
I have two questions for the Committee. First, whom does the provision cover? For example, would a publican be able to exclude me, were I in a wheelchair, on the grounds that he had the right to exclude anyone and did not like the look of my face or my politics? Clearly, he would not be able to exclude me on the grounds that I was in a wheelchair, but would the provision override the right of some service suppliers to say, "You're barred"? I presume that so long as I could not illustrate that his only reason for excluding me was my disability, the other opportunities for a publican to exclude people would remain; but that is not clear because of the essential service element that has been mentioned.<br><br>
My second question relates to what might be regarded as a fairly extreme case, but it is one of which I have personal experience.<br><br>
I accepted an invitation to go to a memorial lecture being given, as it happened, at the National Liberal club. At its entrance I met Rachel Hurst, whom I knew through the Greenwich Association of the Disabled. When I saw her, I asked the person on the door where the lift was. He said that there was no lift, so I asked Rachel what she was there for. She said that she was there to go to a lecture on the first floor. She had done what I had not—because, being in a wheelchair, it mattered to her—and asked whether the building was accessible and whether the lecture was being held in a room that was accessible. It was not. She could not go up so I did not go up either; in a spirit of solidarity, I boycotted the meeting. I happened to bump into an Ulster farmer and went with him to the Farmers club, where there was a lift, for a drink.<br><br>
I hope that if a clause such as this got through, it would catch people—voluntary bodies, professional traders or others—who would wantonly allow a barrier to remain in the way of many who might want to attend such an event or make use of certain services. I do not want to get involved in the issue of schools, to which the Minister referred because I am sure that the hon. Member promoting the Bill will want to deal with it. But I would like to know whether, either through the words or the intention of the legislation, the organisers of a lecture such as the one I have referred to would suffer some kind of penalty or action if they ignored a second time the interests of those whom they knew would want to attend; and whether access to the room would be an essential part of the benefits of belonging to an organisation or a trading concern.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has said that by using the term "qualified" we are trying to establish something equivalent to an ethnic group. That is a strange notion, because the criteria by which one would determine an ethnic group would be entirely different from those used to determine whether someone was qualified. The need for qualification would differ in differing circumstances; there are different forms of goods and services and the conditions in which a person would need to be qualified would differ. We are talking not about exact boundaries but about ones that change in different circumstances.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 114</span>
Qualified people from ethnic groups will remain qualified, but that is not necessarily the case with people with disabilities because people can become disabled in the course of their lives.<br><br>
One of the great practical advantages of using the term "qualified" is that it provides a simple, straightforward concept which enables the people who are assessing—those from the disabled community and the providers of goods and services whom we were discussing earlier—to know what sort of characteristics they should be looking for. It will ensure that they are careful about determining the way in which they will respond to people—whether in a discriminatory way or not. The fact that the Bill is shot through with the term "qualified" has practical advantages for society, not just for the cause; it benefits people who have to function within the confines of the law by giving them some grasp and understanding of the area.<br><br>
As for the academic test, if a person is qualified, he has passed the test; but if he or she is disabled, some account needs to be taken of that. It is a question not of giving special marks to people because they are disabled, lifting them above the level attained by others, but of ensuring that they are able to perform the test and of establishing how they can benefit from having entered a particular school. If a person is dyslexic, provision would need to be thought about and given so that that person could begin to fulfil the test. If that provision does not exist, there is something peculiar about the nature of the examination.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that this is the most important part of the debate, but, as an illustrative example, were I to have no sense of pitch but wanted to attend the Royal College of Music because I enjoyed watching music and the bits of music that I could understand, would my disability be a disqualification against being admitted?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would have thought so, because a sense of pitch would be rather essential to qualify to benefit from the provisions of the college. In other examples, that would not be so. It will be difficult to make judgments on such matters, and are throwing problems on the courts and difficulties on those who must provide codes of practice, whatever the method is; but that does not mean that we should not provide the opportunity for such issues to begin to be developed and elaborated upon. Nor does it mean that we cannot envisage circumstances such as I have sought to describe in which disabled people take a test which, as long as it does not destroy its purpose, makes some provision to assist the disabled person to qualify.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I offer a more practical example which I think is of more importance? The hon. Member for Kingswood said in an advertisement for a "Buses for All" conference that he looked
<br><blockquote><p>"forward to the conference recommendations for achieving this important goal"—</p></blockquote>
of making buses and public transport accessible to all. Age Concern went on to call
<br><blockquote><p>"for the implementation of mandatory access standards for all public transport vehicles",</p></blockquote>
a provision of service that is clearly included in the definition that we are discussing.<br><br>
It is worth asking which approach is right: to work towards mandatory standards or towards a general
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0155">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 115</span>
declaratory principle. I believe that in areas that can be denned—transport is one—it is best to go for mandatory standards which can be passed or failed and which can be raised over the years as it is discovered that if more is achievable, it is worth doing more. That is a practical difference between how the Bill works and how other measures to remove barriers have been taken forward and made progress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This measure has its own dynamic to extend the areas of accessibility for goods and services by disabled people. The key is the role of the Disability Rights Commission in producing codes and provisions and, thereby, influencing the decisions that courts begin to reach. It is one thing to establish general abstract rights but another actually to turn them into realities. The Bill attempts to work in that way. It does not say that wild and exaggerated things must be done tomorrow and that suddenly all the assessed costs are available. It sets processes going—processes which are not likely to get bogged down but which will gather momentum in time. An interpretation of the law under these provisions at one time may change as developments take place. The American constitution has flexibility, offering different possibilities at different stages. Similarly, it is right for this legislation to operate with flexibility. I would not claim that these matters are not fraught with difficulty. Parliament may wish to make adjustments in future. However, the task now is to produce legislation that goes down the right road. The Bill does just that.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
The hon. Member for Eltham raised the issue of access to lectures and whether adjustments would have to be made in time. That is the same concept again. Generally, action has to be taken to facilitate disabled people's ability to participate in academic activities. I grant that there are different means of implementing that, but the Bill provides precisely for it.<br><br>
References need to be made to bodies such as the Disability Rights Commission. The problem is that sometimes that commission can sound like the solution to all the problems of the universe faced by disabled people. Difficulties are often referred to the commission, which has to resolve them. The Disability Rights Commission has to decide its priorities on the many problems that disabled people face. The question of who should be on these bodies is of great significance.<br><br>
The first group of amendments dealing with a qualified worker were easier concepts to deal with. We are now extending that notion to provisions relating to goods and services. In some other areas, the qualified worker concept fits in well—a qualified student, for example, is similar in many respects to a qualified worker. However, embracing all forms of goods and services could lead to difficulties. That problem, though, is outweighed by my initial consideration—that the qualified disabled person concept must be held by employers, providers of services and within disabled communities themselves. The problem must be tackled at its source; the law is relevant to that, so we must take care over the arrangements that we enact.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his response. I accept that he has many good intentions and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 116</span>
that we can all agree with many of his objectives. My worry is whether arrangements would work in practice.<br><br>
He said that using the term "qualified disabled person" is an easier concept to deal with in relation to employment than in this area. He is right. It is difficult enough in the area of employment, but it is particularly difficult when it comes to access to goods, facilities and services. I understand the hon. Gentleman's point that it is meant to be a flexible concept—that who counts as a qualified disabled person will change over time. Here, however, the hon. Gentleman encounters a new problem: a qualified disabled person in part III of the Bill may not be a qualified disabled person in part IV, or vice versa. It is strange to include in legislation a provision that defines someone as a disabled person in some circumstances but not in others.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that that is self-evident. If I were in a wheelchair, at present I would not have access to most of the Underground network in London, but if I were visually handicapped I would have access to it. In both circumstances I should not be disqualified from employment with London Transport in an office job, but if I were visually handicapped I would expect to be able to use the Underground under the provisions on goods and services in part IV. The question would then be whether I would be able to require London Underground to accelerate its work to ensure that the gap between carriages did not look like a doorway to me and cause me to walk on to the rails. If I were in a wheelchair that would not be a requirement because I would not be able to get down on to the platform in most Underground stations.<br><br>
My hon. Friend is misleading himself if he believes that we should accept that, for goods and services, the concept of a "qualified disabled person", whatever that might be, should not be different from that applied to employment rights.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. What I am illustrating is the difficulty created by the concept of a "qualified disabled person". I am sure that once the concept of a "qualified disabled person" has been introduced, the question of who meets that definition will be different in different situations. It may be simpler to take the approach that we have taken in the Disability Discrimination Bill and define who is a disabled person, stick with that definition throughout, but ask for reasonable adjustments or changes to working practices to be made where appropriate. I am illustrating the sort of complexity that this approach could lead to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not this complexity the same as the complexity of defining discrimination in a variety of circumstances? Whatever language people choose to use, the complexity still exists. We need a defining mechanism. The important thing is not that the definition of a "qualified disabled person" should be applied differently in different circumstances, but that we should define the situations in which discrimination has taken place. The Minister is happy to apply the term "discrimination" to radically different circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may underestimate the difficulties created by providing a definition of a "qualified disabled person" that is different in different circumstances. We must be able to explain the legislation
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0156">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 117</span>
to millions of people who will have to implement it, such as employers and service providers. It will be extremely confusing if we have to say that someone working for Marks and Spencer is a disabled person, but when he goes downstairs and buys items from the shop he may or may not be a disabled person. If we created such a concept it would be extremely difficult to explain to the country and to ensure that it worked.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The qualification should be seen in terms of the person being qualified to do the job, to purchase the goods and to have the services. That may differ in differing circumstances, as it does with any other qualified person in society. I read the press and I see that the Minister has almost qualified to be in the Cabinet. There are different forms of qualification and presumably he is not qualified to do certain things. The notion that a person qualifies as a disabled person according to circumstances is difficult for people to understand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like many stories in the press, that one should be heavily discounted. I think that people will readily see that there is a simpler solution to the problem. The Bill goes round the houses to achieve the same objective, and I am not sure that it achieves it effectively.<br><br>
My remark about the differing definitions was made only in passing. My basic difficulty with the concept as it is used in part IV is the one that I illustrated with the example of a person applying to enter a school. The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East answered my question by saying that steps should be taken to ensure that that person can perform the test. I am sure that that is the common sense answer, with which most hon. Members would agree, but we do not know that that is the answer that would be arrived at.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East acknowledged that, after the Bill had been passed, we might discover that the provision needed to be adjusted. He said that Parliament may want to look at the way in which matters have developed and make adjustments. One of my fundamental difficulties with the Bill is that Parliament will not be able to do that without passing further primary legislation. The hon. Gentleman knows, as I do, how difficult that is and how rare are the opportunities. That is why the Government Bill contains regulation-making powers to enable Parliament to make adjustments, clarify definitions and make it clear that a provision was meant to be included. This Bill does not contain such provisions. The hon. Gentleman places all his faith in the commission to make such adjustments, not in the nation's legislature. That is an important error that recurs throughout the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The commission's reports would be expected to come before Parliament, which could accept or reject its proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not doubt that the commission's reports and the codes of practices laid down in the Bill would come before Parliament, but those codes of practice would not have the force of law and Parliament would not be able to take the lead in initiating changes to the legislation to clarify or alter how it was intended to work. That is a fundamental problem with the Bill. We will not resolve it in this Committee, but I want to place

it clearly on the record. My anxiety about it has not been alleviated by our discussion of the amendments, but they have allowed an opportunity to air the issues and to set out our concerns. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an extensive debate on clause 1 which has demonstrated some of the differences of view in the Committee. Those differences have centred on the concept of a qualified disabled person and on the nature of essential functions. Also, when we debated the first part of the clause last week, the Committee discussed whether a person who has or had a reputation as a disabled person should be defined as disabled. Important differences persist, and I remain convinced that the Bill's definition of disability is unworkable and lacks credibility. The Bill's attempt to set up a framework for rights is confusing and convoluted.<br><br>
However, there is also agreement between members of the Committee on a number of matters. I am pleased that those who drafted the Bill accepted the need to confine rights to people with a substantial disability. That is the clear intention underlying the statement that a disabled person is one who has an impairment that
<br><blockquote><p>"substantially limits one or more of the major life activities",</p></blockquote>
whatever difficulty we may have with the phrase "major life activities". It would be wrong to cover minor disabilities, notwithstanding the attempts of some hon. Members on the Committee considering the Disability Discrimination Bill to remove the word "substantial" from the Government's Bill.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
A definition that covered everyone would benefit no one. A universal prohibition against unfavourable treatment would leave us looking for a more circumscribed definition which caught the special features of discrimination against disabled people as opposed to general prejudice against particular individuals for a variety of reasons. If we are serious about eliminating discrimination against disabled people, we need a precise instrument, not a blunt tool. The instrument of the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill will not be precise enough.<br><br>
The second major area of agreement between us is the rejection for legislative purposes of the social model of disability. In its extreme form, this model posits the notion that disability is a product of society's indifference to people with physical or mental impairment. Let me say, however, that I have great sympathy for the more moderate version of this theory. Hon. Members will know from the legislation that I have introduced that I firmly believe that society and this country could do more to prevent avoidable hindrances to disabled people. That is what the Disability Discrimination Bill was partly about.<br><br>
Disabled people could live more independent lives if we ordered our affairs a little differently. The could be spared many difficulties by simple forethought, as outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham. We
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0157">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 119</span>
can create an environment less littered with obstacles. That is why the Government want to introduce legislation requiring society to take reasonable steps to cater more sensitively for the needs of disabled people. However, we shall do disabled people no favours by pretending that they are merely differently abled. Impairments, when substantial, are genuinely limiting. We cannot wish disability away by choosing a misguided definition for the sake of political correctness. I am therefore pleased that the Bill's drafters have chosen the so-called medical model for their definition of disability.<br><br>
There are those areas of agreement between us; it is fair to point them out. There have also been substantial areas of disagreement. I shall not seek to divide the Committee on the clause standing part of the Bill, but I hope that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East will acknowledge my worries about how the clause has been constructed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the nature of our discussions today, away from the pressures that were on us last week. We have adopted a different approach. The Minister's speeches may not be as long, or ours as short as on that occasion.<br><br>
One of the issues not covered but raised in earlier amendments was the scope of definition. Supporters of the Bill have always claimed that 6.5 million people or more are covered by the provisions. That fits in—albeit in a rough and ready way—with the estimates of the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys: 6.2 million in Britain, as opposed to the United Kingdom. The cost assessment carried out for last year's Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill seized on that largish figure.<br><br>
There is a sense, however, in which numbers do not cover everything. Most important are the forms of action that are provided against discrimination and the ability of disabled people to participate more fully in society—so that they can consider themselves as people who are available for jobs, who can earn, who can use goods and services and who can contribute considerably to the well-being of society. In many cases, the extra numbers that might be considered to have been covered in this Bill, rather than in the Government's Bill, do not necessarily involve all the knock-on costs. I welcome the fact that the Committee will not divide on the clause stand part debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Committee knows, I am ambivalent about the Bill. The more that I listen to the arguments, the more I am convinced that my earlier comments were right: it would be far better for the campaigners and the various Ministers involved to find out whether they could agree on ways to go forward. We might be able to get through this clause and others, but only a person from Mars, who had not been around for long, would expect the Bill to get back to the Floor of the House of Commons. Whatever we do with this clause or others, we will not make substantial progress, even on the clauses about access to polling stations.<br><br>
Underlying the definitions and their difficulties and advantages is the expectation of cultural and practical change to allow more people to do what they have the right to do—to move, to shop, to work and to take part in the ordinary activities of life. The only question is how that can be achieved. Is it by creating rights or
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 120</span>
obligations? The answer is a bit of both, but can we achieve the underlying change where people build in to what they do rather than trying to bolt on action afterwards?<br><br>
I referred earlier to a meeting that I did not attend at the National Liberal Club. I now find, from an invitation, that the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development's United Kingdom committee is holding a meeting in the same room—the Lloyd George room of the National Liberal Club. There is nothing on the invitation to say that that room is inaccessible to certain people. There is nothing to say that one needs to be able to climb heaven knows how many stairs—30 or 40—to get to the room. One of the cultural changes that I want, which might happen as a consequence of some of the definitions in later clauses, is for people to start stating that certain rooms are not accessible, so that people at least knew and could challenge the organisation involved for not ensuring an essential element of holding a meeting—that people be able to get there.<br><br>
I do not want to drift too far back into anecdotage, but when I was a junior Minister in Northern Ireland, I tested the centre of Belfast for shopping for someone in a wheelchair. I went with someone who had to be in a wheelchair. We borrowed a wheelchair and went around and we discovered that even in shops that had received substantial public grants to extend and expand, the men's outfitting department had been put in a basement with no lift. Hundreds of thousands of pounds had been spent, a significant proportion from public funds, and there was total inaccessibility.<br><br>
There have been examples of where people have improved the street environment, but have managed to put things in the middle of pavements so that people in wheelchairs cannot get past. It may not have escaped poeple's attention that the same type of thing happens at Waterloo station, not three-quarters of a mile from here. If one leaves the Eurostar and goes past the taxi rank on the direct wheelchair route to Westminster, there are barriers on the pavement to stop the luggage carts getting out. Those barriers are carefully designed to stop wheelchairs getting out, too. A person in a wheelchair would have to go around on the road, as would a person who wanted to wheel a cart, so what is the purpose of the barriers? Did the designers take account of the needs of people with disabilities when those arrangements were made?<br><br>
I am not suggesting that the decisions are easy for commercial or educational organisations or for places of employment. I am not arguing that the current situation is satisfactory. But we ought to be able to make more practical progress, including progress on necessary definitions and improvements of definitions. The campaigners need to get away from the idea that the best way forward is to hit headlong into the fact that the Government have not accepted the definitions or the proposals.<br><br>
My guess is that were there to be a different Government, although I accept that the campaigners for this Bill have always been bipartisan, and were the right hon. Member for Wythenshawe—the father of Ministers of disability if I can put it that way—to be the Minister, I do not believe that the Bill would automatically be accepted with the definitions as they stand in the clause, let alone with the approach that exists in the rest of the Bill. If I am right in saying that, I make my usual
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0158">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 121</span>
comprising plea to campaigners, as I have (luring my almost 20 years in the House: it is far better to get close to Ministers and Ministries, as more progress is made in that way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Eltham is being somewhat unfair to campaigners. There have been attempts to get close to Ministers over the past 15 or so years and, to my direct knowledge, there have been extensive contacts with Ministers and others about antidiscrimination legislation over the past two or three years. Campaigners across the whole spectrum, not just hon. Members, met the previous Minister for Social Security and Disabled People and many of his colleagues. It is therefore inaccurate to suggest that campaigners have been banging on about the issue and have made no serious attempt to have a sensible exchange of ideas with Ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I misinterpreted the hon. Gentleman, I apologise. He spoke about campaigners hitting out in expressing their position. There were extensive efforts in previous years to put a case for anti-discrimination legislation. Campaigners have put that case very constructively and, for reasons which I shall not go into, one can understand why, until recently, campaigners felt unhappy about the way that they were being treated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The efforts that my hon. Friend describes are also taking place this year. Organisations for disabled people have concentrated on the Bill and on the Government Bill and the Minister has met people from many organisations. It is a continuous process.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I do not think that anyone believes that the Bill could not be improved in any way. No one would think that about any piece of legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that the hon. Gentleman is straying from the debate on clause 1, as did the hon. Member for Eltham.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Maxton. I shall briefly refer to the Minister's comment that those who support the Bill have rejected the social model of disability in favour of the medical definition. I thought for a moment that we were getting to the high theory of disability discrimination. I am sure that members of the Committee will not want to go too far into that but I shall make two obvious points on it. First, the definition of a disabled person in the Bill specifically includes those with a history of impairment or people who have a reputation for being disabled, similar to the definition in the Americans with Disabilities Act of people who are regarded as being disabled. How one can describe that as anything other than a social definition, I do not know. There is not much between us on this point and I am sorry that the Minister threw that point in.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's comments. Has he seen the article by Colin Barnes of Leeds university and Mike Oliver of Greenwich? Their views are very important because they are two of the major academic proponents of the social model. I am sure
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 122</span>
that the hon. Gentleman is familiar with their writing. In a recent issue of the journal <i>Disability and Society,</i> they said
<br><blockquote><p>"… the Bill"</p></blockquote>
—this Bill—
<br><blockquote><p>"is firmly rooted in the medical rather than the social model of disability. It sets out to 'prohibit discrimination against disabled people on the grounds of their (not society's) disability.' "</p></blockquote>
In their article, they referred to that as "the first problem" with the Bill. So I am not the only person who thinks that it rejects the social model of disability.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I note the Minister's comment. I am aware of those authors' work in general but I have not read that article. But I think that it would be generally recognised that the Bill is premised on the fact that while discrimination partly arises because of individual impairments, that discrimination is based on society's response to those impairments. It is therefore inconceivable that one could talk about discrimination in society without an understanding of how societies operate. Certainly, one could not have a definition that included the idea that people might be discriminated against because of their history or reputation in society without having a social view of discrimination.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
I do not think that anyone could say that this definition simply adopts a medical definition of disability. Indeed, on previous occasions the Minister argued against parts of this definition on precisely the grounds that it is too vague, too woolly and does not coincide with what most people normally regard as a definition of disability. The Minister cannot use that argument on one day, and then claim the next day that we have adopted a narrow medical definition of disability.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Gentleman said that he did not think that anybody could argue that the definition was based on a medical definition of disability. The article that I quoted to him was by people with whom I may not agree—I am not saying that I necessarily agree with them on a range of other matters—but they said,
<br><blockquote><p>"the Bill is firmly rooted in the medical … model".</p></blockquote>
People can argue that, and I am not seeking to quarrel with the hon. Gentleman; rather, I am welcoming an area of agreement across the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the Minister is correct in saying that that has been argued. I merely point out, in response to the Minister's comment about whether we are adopting a medical or a social definition, the fact that the definition in clause 1 is firmly rooted in the notion that it is society which discriminates against disabled people by virtue of denying individuals with impairments or with a history of impairments the same rights as everyone else. I do not regard that as a narrow medical definition of disability; it is a recognition that in order to deal with discrimination, we need to transform the way in which society treats people. Whether one regards that as an adequate approach or not, it is clearly based on the idea that we collectively, as society, create institutions that discriminate and create barriers to equal access. I regard that as a social view of discrimination on the grounds of disability and I am sure that my colleagues do, too.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0159">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 123</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman regards this as a useful issue for debate. I appreciate that he did not introduce it, but do we really need to get hung up on such a polarisation? Cannot we all accept that there are, in the Bill's terms, physical, sensory or mental impairments which can be termed medical—and they are disabling—but that society's discrimination is further disabling? It is that source of disability that we can act on and which the Bill would enable us to act on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct but there is a difficulty. If we talk about the social model, we cannot treat the use of the term "discrimination" separately from the definition of disability. Clause 1 is only about the definition of disability and if we hold a proper debate on what the social model is all about, we cannot simply examine the definition without thinking about what we mean by discrimination.<br><br>
There are many supporters of the Bill who would not accept the Minister's view and, indeed, the view of others whom he has quoted this morning: that we are adopting a narrow medical definition of disability that is divorced from the social model approach. I do not believe that that is correct.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For what it is worth, I think that the definition is partly medical and partly social. Three separate groups of people are defined as disabled. The definition of the first two seems to be based on a physical assessment while the third, which relates to their reputation, is based more on a social assessment, or the general opinion.<br><br>
The issue is important, and it is why I still have reservations about clause 1.I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham that changing attitudes is as important as changing the law. There is a subtle trade-off: the law can have an important declaratory effect, with Parliament sending a strong message that it disapproves of discrimination. However, it can be counter productive to go too far. Too broad a definition of disabled people might not be accepted by most people and so could be counter productive.<br><br>
The Bill's sponsor has said that 6.5 million people would be covered by the Bill. I accept that. I do not suggest that we should insist that the total should be 6 million, 5.5 million or 5 million, but I remain unhappy about the definition, which the Committee has decided not to change. I think that the definition will be counter productive: if we stick with it, it will be more difficult to persuade people that the Bill is reasonable and sensible.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
DEFINITION OF DISCRIMINATION</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 7, in page 2, line 29, leave out "that" and insert "an".<br><br>
Clause 2(a) is part of the general definition of discrimination which applies to all parts of the Bill. For the purposes of deciding whether or not the treatment of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 124</span>
a disabled person with an impairment is less favourable it makes comparison with the treatment of others who do not have the same impairment. These could be non-disabled people or people with a different impairment.<br><br>
I consider the subsection to be unnecessarily restrictive and that it makes the Bill difficult to interpret. Courts and tribunals would have problems selecting the most appropriate comparison. If the comparison is with a person "without that impairment", as clause 2(a) puts it, an employer may be able to say, "I did not employ the blind person, but neither did I employ the person in a wheelchair." Surely the comparison should be made with a non-disabled person, as we are trying to ensure that disabled people are given the same opportunities as non-disabled people.<br><br>
We need a clearer and more workable definition than that set out in clause 2(a). Most people conceive of discrimination against disabled people in terms of their mistreatment in comparison with non-disabled people. The amendment accords with that concept. It would enable a comparison to be made between the treatment of a disabled person and the treatment of people who are not disabled. I hope that the Committee will accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the logic of the Minister's argument, and the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause, which is much improved by the amendment, is vital to a Bill such as this. No antidiscrimination Bill can do without a definition of discrimination, but I cannot help but wonder at some of the wording used elsewhere in the clause. I find the approach puzzling, and should welcome clarification on a number of matters.<br><br>
Clause 2(b) refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"a disabled person with an impairment".</p></blockquote>
Clause 1 defines a disabled person as, among other things, a person with
<br><blockquote><p>"a physical, sensory or mental impairment".</p></blockquote>
A disabled person is thus already, by definition, someone with an impairment. So what is meant by clause 2's reference to
<br><blockquote><p>"a disabled person with an impairment"?</p></blockquote>
Is that wording a recognition that only someone with an impairment should be protected by the Bill, as opposed to those reputed to have an impairment as we discussed in our debate on clause 1? I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East intended it, but that is the effect of the wording of the clause. I hope that he will tell us exactly what he intended.<br><br>
My second concern is how an employer or service provider could be sure that other people with similar disabilities could not comply with the requirement alleged to be discriminatory. We partly dealt with that in relation to earlier amendments. Clause 2(b)(i) refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"the proportion of persons without that impairment".</p></blockquote>
That creates a difficulty for an employer. How can an employer know what proportion of people with or without
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0160">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 125</span>
impairment are necessary to comply with the requirement? Will a data base be established for this purpose? It seems a strange way to go about it.<br><br>
My third question is on a related but different point. The inability to comply with a requirement may stem from the severity of an impairment rather than the mere fact that a particular impairment exists. Reduced vision, for example, varies enormously. For some, the degree of sight lost is so minor that little disability ensues. For others, even where a lot of vision is lost, their ability to do particular jobs is not seriously hampered. But there may come a point at which the degree of vision loss does mean that an employee is no longer able to meet a particular job requirement. The question for the employer is whether the inability is due to the impairment itself, or the degree of impairment, or the degree of impairment allied with the particular employee's ability to cope or to overcome or compensate for the effects. With whom is he to make a comparison in deciding whether he is at risk of discriminating against the employee?<br><br>
It would seem almost impossible for an employer to obtain sufficiently detailed or comprehensive information to know whether he is breaking the law under clause 2(b)(i). So I am not at all clear about how the clause would work in practice. I hope that the hon. Gentleman or other members of the Committee can clear up the muddle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have two points. First, I may have a personal dislike of political correctness, but should not the word "he" be replaced by "they" to describe an individual of either sex? It is a point for parliamentary draftsmen to consider.<br><br>
Secondly and following on from the comments made by my hon. Friend the Minister, how would it read if clause 2(b)(i) were omitted? It would then be discrimination if a disabled person were treated "less favourably" and the requirement would remain
<br><blockquote><p>"to be justifiable in the circumstances of the case".</p></blockquote>
It would be interesting to know what is added by clause 2(b)(i). My hon. Friend the Minister made a genuine point, but I do not want to extend it into nitpicking. Nevertheless, will the Bill's sponsors explain why that subsection is necessary?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find the Minister's comments puzzling. He speaks against certain elements of the clause. He initially tabled 113 amendments, yet there are no amendments to overcome the specific problems that he has outlined. It would be helpful if the approach were consistent: there should either be masses of amendments to tidy everything up or, better still, fewer amendments but clause stand part debates in which we could pursue such problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a little confused by the hon. Gentleman's comments. He complained last week that my hon. Friend had tabled too many amendments; he now appears to be saying that he should have tabled more.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are far too many amendments, and I have spoken about the purpose of those amendments. There is an illogicality about tabling masses of amendments: there are points to be argued about, and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 126</span>
amendments have been tabled on them elsewhere, but there is nothing about them here. I am not being illogical; the Minister is, because of the position he has taken. I am not asking for more amendments; indeed, I hope that amendments will be withdrawn so that we can have debates more like the one we are having now in which the Minister has raised his concerns and we can discuss them.<br><br>
The first problem the Minister raised concerns clause 2(a), which refers to a disabled person with an impairment, which has already been dealt with in the definitions in clause 1. We are therefore being accused of using a term that is either tautological and rather superfluous because it has been outlined before or inconsistent with earlier definitions of a disabled person, because they referred to a person with a reputation of having an impairment. I do not understand how we can be accused of inconsistency, however, because the term impairment is always included in references to a disabled person. The choice of words might not, as the Minister noted, seem necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may elucidate. My worry is that the definition in clause 2 conflicts with definitions in clause 1. A disabled person now seems to refer only to someone with an impairment. In clause 1, people without an impairment, but who might have a reputation or a history of impairment are qualified disabled people, but they are not covered by the definition in clause 2. The hon. Gentleman is creating a nightmare for a court or tribunal. The clause would be better if the words "without an impairment" were not included.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the Minister's point. Although references are made to impairment in clause 1(b) and (c), they concern the history and the reputation of impairment, not the impairment itself. The Minister recognises the danger that only the definition in clause 1(a) would therefore be applicable in clause 2. I accept that the term is seen as either unnecessary or inconsistent and that the Minister has a point. We shall have to consider the issue so that we can clarify it at a later stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman explain why clause 2(c) refers to a disabled person and does not include the words "with an impairment"? Is that deliberate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has hit upon an inadequacy in the drafting of the Bill. Other, similar inadequacies have been identified by the Minister, such as the reference to Great Britain instead of the United Kingdom. That obviously needs to be put right.<br><br>
I am not claiming that the Bill is perfect and does not require alterations and additions. I will accept some of the Minister's recommendations in that regard. Given that we now have an amendment that allows a Report stage, such matters can be corrected then.<br><br>
The Minister asked whether a database needed to be kept in relation to clause 2(b)(i) to determine who fits into different categories at work. Clearly, the provision does not require that, and it exaggerates the problem to suggest that it does. The general information held about a work force is all that is required.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I exaggerate the case. A tribunal, court or employer would face huge difficulty in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0161">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 127</span>
deciding whether the proportion of persons with a particular impairment who can comply with a requirement is substantially higher—whatever "substantially" means in this context—than the proportion of such people who cannot.<br><br>
A whole range of words is open to question. Such words can mean different things on different occasions, but this problem arises in the actual definition of discrimination on which everything else in the Bill rests. That is a serious problem, and should be recognised as such.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 2(b)(i) contains the word "substantially" but that does not mean that employers would have to maintain an elaborate and expensive database to keep precise records of the proportion of each disability faced by their respective work forces. Discovering the balance in a particular work force would require only general information. The Minister appeared to stretch the point somewhat. He went to a logical extreme in exposing what he considered to be the problem with clause 2(b)(i).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to labour the point, but it is at the heart of the Bill. Does the hon. Gentleman mean that the proportion that must be considered is within the work force, and that employers will know that proportion because they will know their own work forces? If that is his argument, what does an employer do when mere are no people in the work force who do the same job?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that will happen in the case of someone who is disabled qualifying for a single job. So I do not see the difficulties that the Minister keeps raising. Surely it is feasible for tribunals to make judgments on evidence that is based on the words in the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is horribly complicated. The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East did not respond to the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham. Why is the word "and" used at the end of line 38? Would not it be better if the first requirement were simply left out, as my hon. Friend was suggesting? It would then say:
<br><blockquote><p>"he cannot show the requirement to be justifiable in the circumstances of the case".</p></blockquote>
That seems all-embracing. Why is it necessary to include the first requirement?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may have been lifted from some American legislation; Americans go in more for quota-ism than we do. If that is the case, the sponsors of the Bill may concede that it does not need to be defended. It is too late for an amendment on that to be tabled but it may be signalled on Report or in another place that that part of the clause could be dropped without any loss to anyone. It would be interesting to know where it came from.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: that is helpful. My general point is that the legislation needs to be as simple and clear as possible. It will apply to all employers, regardless of their size, and I believe that many small employers would have considerable difficulty working out what the words mean.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 128</span>
If it were possible to achieve the same end by leaving out the first requirement, that would be a great improvement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the first requirement is to ensure that the employer has at the front of his or her mind the problem of proportions. The words might be better expressed; that could be looked at on Report. I am not convinced that the section should be removed entirely because (b)(ii) deals adequately with the matter—the comparison in (b)(i) needs to be included.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may not be appropriate to deal with a clause stand part debate as though we were discussing an amendment to leave out 2(b)(i), but the debate has illustrated that the clause has not satisfied members of the Committee. There has not been obstruction—and I do not want to encourage it—but it might be helpful if the hon. Member for Kingswood or the right hon. Member for Wythenshawe, or anyone who has been with the Bill for some time, could find out where that subsection came from and write to members of the Committee to tell us. It would also be helpful if some of the groups supporting the Bill told us whether they think there would be any significant loss by its deletion. It is not a big enough point to deal with today, but the justification for it has not been satisfactorily offered. The Minister made a fair point: it introduces an imprecise complication and I cannot see the slightest purpose in it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has put it well: the Committee has not been satisfied that the clause has been properly thought out or put together. The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East regretted that I had not tabled amendments which would have helped us to sort it out. Indeed, I now rather regret not having tabled such amendments, but I cam in for enough criticism for tabling the amendments that I did. The problem illustrates the fact that we would need a substantial body of amendments to make the legislation workable and to make it mean what it wants to say.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman recognised the inadequacy in the drafting of the Bill. He tried to leave open the question for another day, although I do not think that he has committed himself to removing the offending subsection. I think that he accepts that the words "with an impairment" need to be removed from clause 2(b), and that satisfies my first concern, but the hon. Gentleman has in no way satisfied my concern about clause 2(b)(i)—the reasons that my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham mentioned.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman tried to reassure us that the matter was something that people would just know and that courts or tribunals or anybody could make an assessment, although it has not been made at all clear how that would happen, or what proportion of people could comply with which requirements and what proportion of people with an impairment could not comply with a certain requirement.<br><br>
I should tell the hon. Gentleman that in British courts statistics are needed to prove indirect discrimination. The courts have not accepted that adverse disproportionate impact can be shown on the basis of arguing that everyone
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0162">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 129</span>
knows that such and such a group is treated worse in specific circumstances. Statistics would be needed, although the hon. Gentleman has not recognised that. That is one of the great difficulties that would emerge.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also did not respond to my concerns about what happens when problems stem from the severity of an impairment rather than the mere existence of an impairment, a question that greatly complicates any assessment made under clause 2(b)(i), where it might be necessary to compare a group of people, not with an impairment as such but with an impairment such as a loss of vision to a specific degree.<br><br>
Although the debate has been useful, it has demonstrated the extremely unsatisfactory nature of the drafting of parts of the Bill. Any legislation such as this would need a great deal more work before it would be fit to put on the statute book. The hon. Gentleman suggested that he would return to the matter if the opportunity arose. I shall not divide the Committee on clause 2, but it is pretty much a shambles and would need to be considerably improved before it could be made to work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having taken the bait that the Minister laid on the medical versus social model issue, I am somewhat reluctant to do so again. However, the facts of the case are quite straightforward. The Minister made some perfectly fair points and my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East suggested that, of course, the supporters of the Bill would try to examine the wording again.<br><br>
The facts of history are that the Bill has been through several drafts since four years ago when my right hon. Friend the Member for Wythenshawe first prepared it. It is a tribute to those who are sponsoring the Bill, not a criticism, that comments were made by various organisations about the terms used in the Bill and it is patently clear that inconsistencies have arisen because—[<i>Interruption.</i>] It is best to be honest about how we got to where we are and it is clear that as the Bill has evolved, some points have been taken on board and clause 2 now requires some redrafting.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East said that as far as the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill was concerned, he would do that. I hope that the Minister will also continue to listen carefully to what organsiations say about the definitions of disability and discrimination. It is precisely because we listened to comments about those definitions that we now find ourselves in this slightly uncomfortable position. My hon. Friend has given the necessary undertaking and I am sure that when we are next required to present the Bill, the clause will be drafted slightly more tightly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Notwithstanding that speech and the fact that I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the definition is defective—I think that he is right to say openly how that may have happened. I still think that we ought to let the clause stand part. To vote against it, even with its defects, would wreck the Bill, and whatever else people might say about the Bill or its handling or their doubts about it, to try to knock out clause 2 would be misinterpreted. It would also be unnecessary, because if it turns out that a single subsection is the only cause of difficulty in the clause, it could be remedied later.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 130</span>
Perhaps I might give notice, Mr. Maxton, that when the clause has been dealt with, I want to raise a point of order about future progress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister exaggerates the position. He claims that because of the problems that we found in connection with clause 2, the whole Bill is inadequately drafted. We have been through two clauses so far, and we did not find that to be true about clause 1. The Minister might have felt differently, but the Bill's supporters did not think so.<br><br>
The two matters that have been raised certainly need further investigation. With regard to the first, which appears either to be contradicting some of the elements of clause 1 or at least to be tautological, it is right to say that we are prepared to remove it. As for the other issue, the hon. Member for Eltham suggested that we provide further information and conduct further investigation. That seems to be an entirely appropriate suggestion and I hope, therefore, that he will support the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham that we should allow clause 2 to stand part and like him, I commend the honesty and straightforward approach of the hon. Member for Kingswood who said that many people had made suggestions which had been incorporated, with a resultant inconsistency.<br><br>
It is, of course, important to listen to people and—as the hon. Gentleman knows—I and my officials in the Department of Social Security and in other Departments have spent many months in discussions with people outside the Government about the terminology and structure of our own Disability Discrimination Bill. It is also important, having listened, to get it right so that the whole thing still works. It is alarming that the Bill does not work in this fundamentally important clause; although we were told last week that it ought to be able to pass through its Committee stage in a matter of hours. However, having said that, I will not oppose the question of clause stand part.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Clause 2, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. There are no usual channels in this Committee, as there normally are in Standing Committee C, and there is no prospect—I think I can say this without fear of contradiction—that we will be able to get through all the amendments that have been tabled and the clause stand part debates in the foreseeable future, to put it gently.<br><br>
We have had difficulty once this morning in making the Committee quorate but I make no comment on individual members. It is a busy time for all of us and there are various reasons why hon. Members cannot be here or may need to leave the room for short periods. It is also a matter of record that Conservative Members have kept the Committee quorate for as long as possible as a result of their general involvement in the serious issues that we are discussing. Some of us are trying to plan our diaries for the days and weeks ahead. We do not have a sittings motion, so we presume that we will come back next Wednesday morning unless the Committee makes some other decision.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0163">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 131</span>
Would it be fair to say that it is open to members of the Committee and to the promoter to consider informally how the progress of the Bill should be handled? Might it be possible to adopt the suggestion made last week that we pick out provisions which, by agreement with the Government and the usual channels, could at least get through the House of Commons stages so that we could reduce some of the uncertainty affecting forward planning for those of us who are concerned with the issues as well as with the Bill? That would be helpful to me and to other members of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is well aware that that is not a point of order for the Chair. The future progress of the Bill is a matter for the promoter of the Bill. The hon. Gentleman is, however, right to say that, unless there is a sittings motion, next Wednesday will be the next sitting of the Committee.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
THE DISABILITY RIGHTS COMMISSION</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page 4, line 15, leave out "11 and 12" and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"26, 27, 28 and 29".</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to correct what I believe to be—the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East can tell me if I am wrong—a misplaced reference to sections 11 and 12. I assume that the hon. Gentleman intended to refer to the enforcement sections of the Bill—that is, to clauses 26, 27, 28 and 29. If that is so, that error must be put right, along with some of the matters which we have discussed and which we shall no doubt come to discuss. I hope that he will accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the amendment for the reasons that the Minister outlined.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. Are we taking this clause with schedule 1 or is it taken separately?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Schedule 1 comes next, and it is separate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is one of the clauses to which I could have tabled a large number of amendments. I hope that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East will not say that I should have done. I did not do so because this topic was discussed in connection with the Disability Discrimination Bill, not only in Committee but on Report, when it was debated on the Floor of the House and we had a Division. I took the view that if this Bill were ever to be reported, it would be appropriate, subject to Madam Speaker's selection of amendments, to return to this matter on the Floor of the House, because it was the House as a whole that had made decisions about it.<br><br>
I hesitate to detain the Committee on this question: I shall try not to do so, but it depends on the extent to which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 132</span>
hon. Members wish to engage in debate on it. The Government's position on whether to have a Disability Rights Commission is well known. While we are very much in favour of wide-ranging, anti-discrimination legislation, we are not in favour of setting up a commission to carry out the various functions listed in the Bill.<br><br>
We have proposed a National Disability Council, which will be free to provide advice on its own initiative on the operation of legislation or Government policy. It will produce codes of practice and provide clear and practical advice to disabled people and businesses in what will be a complex area of legislation. Our proposals for the preparation of codes of practice will differentiate between the responsibilities of the Government and those of the council. We debated that in relation to the Disability Discrimination Bill, which adopts a fundamentally different approach from that in the clause.<br><br>
I know that the Bill's sponsors would argue that the commission would be responsible for investigating and conciliating on complaints. However, I am not convinced that that is the best way to tackle discrimination in this area and I have proposed a different way of providing conciliation, advice and support.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
In the area of goods and services we intend to provide a nationwide advice and support network, a place where people can meet face to face if necessary, without travelling long distances—a point that is of particular concern to disabled people. Inevitably, that process will involve an exploration of the facts and, in this area in particular, local knowledge could play an important role in bringing greater understanding to resolving disputes involving physical access. We also intend that a standard investigation procedure should apply throughout the country. Service providers will welcome a consistent approach. Where disputes cannot be resolved in this forum, there will be recourse to the county courts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Corbett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Erdington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell us about discussions with the citizens advice bureau, which he envisaged as the main provider of the local advisory service?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux has said that it will not be able to provide the service to which I refer. I made that clear in a written answer to the hon. Member for Kings wood about 10 days ago. Nevertheless, citizens advice bureaux will have an important part to play. They are likely to be the first port of call for disabled people seeking advice on their rights under the Disability Discrimination Bill. I am sure that they will do all they can to provide advice. Indeed, although I am sure it will not be necessary, they will be compelled to do so by virtue of the Bill's right of access for disabled people to any service providing information. We shall ensure that there is plentiful, detailed advice available for the bureaux in the form of leaflets and guidance on the new legislation.<br><br>
There will be cases where disabled people will need more specialist advice than the bureaux can provide. Our discussions with NACAB were very useful in identifying this need for a higher-tier advice service. I am sorry that NACAB did not feel able to continue discussing with me
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0164">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 133</span>
how that might be provided. We continue to explore the possibilities, however, and will be looking at other providers of advice as well as the lessons to be learnt for the evaluation of the national disability information project funded by the Department of Health. The sort of advice and support to which I referred during the passage of the Disability Discrimination Bill will continue to be available.<br><br>
In the area of employment, the Employment Service will be able to help employers and disabled people identify suitable adjustments at the workplace. Where a complaint is made to a tribunal, there will access to the conciliation services provided by the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service, which has many years of experience of conciliation on employment issues.<br><br>
So the Government are putting in place a different framework, which will work and will be successful. It is an alternative to the commission proposed in the Bill. Any adequate approach must make people's rights and duties clear. The majority of employers and service providers will want to comply with the legislation if we can effectively communicate and explain their responsibilities.<br><br>
The Government favour a three-pronged approach. First, a National Disability Council would be set up to provide advice and to draft codes of practice. In this Bill, those functions would form part of the commission's remit. Secondly, various advice and support services would be made available to people who feel that they are not receiving the treatment that they should under the provisions of anti-discrimination legislation. Thirdly, people's responsibilities would be clearly communicated to them.<br><br>
I believe that such an approach would work, and it has been approved already by the House. If the Bill were to proceed to a later stage, I would want to return to the matter in more detail and to ask the House to reaffirm the decision that it has already made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right to say that the Government's view of the commission is well known. At present, they can see no case for establishing such a commission.<br><br>
What is less well known is the Government's alternative. The Minister has just spoken about the need for proper advice and for the enforcement powers that any legislation requires. Yet it is still uncertain what the Government intend in that regard. It is true that the House rejected an amendment in support of the commission, but the word at that time was that citizens advice bureaux would play an important role. The Minister has confirmed that NACAB is unable to provide the specialist advice needed. Given the pressures on citizens advice bureaux throughout the country, I should have been astonished if they had agreed to take on the massive additional responsibilities involved without any extra funding. I wonder about the detail of the discussions, but it is clear that the citizens advice bureaux are not able to provide the service that the Minister seemed to expect of them.<br><br>
To some extent I am heartened: when I questioned the Prime Minister last Tuesday about the endorsement provisions in the Government's Bill—I am dealing with the enforcement provisions of anti-discrimination legislation, so I hope that it is in order to refer to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 134</span>
Government's Bill—and asked how the Government would enforce anti-discrimination legislation, he replied:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Bill"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the Government's Bill—
<br><blockquote><p>"contains a wide number of provisions. It also contains the provision for the National Disability Council to advise the Government on such issues and we will take whatever advice it chooses to give us on that issue."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 25 April 1995; Vol. 258, <i>c.</i> 659.]</p></blockquote>
I understand why the Minister is nodding—that is his job. However, the House was told that a National Disability Council, which will not be established until the Government's Bill reaches the statute book, will advise the Government on the Bill's enforcement. The really good news is that the Government will do whatever the council tells them to do—or so we are told.<br><br>
I have sat in this Committee for the past couple of hours feeling slightly nervous that bits of this Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill are not absolutely rigorous and that some uncertainties about it persist. However, no criticism of this Bill compares with the complete uncertainty about how the Government intend to enforce their own anti-discrimination legislation. That enforcement is a blank piece of paper. The matter is completely up in the air.<br><br>
That is inadequate. We need something like the proposed commission. Frankly, I do not care what it is called. We have commissions for racial equality and for equal opportunities. For the life of me, I cannot understand why we can have commissions to advise, investigate and enforce in matters of discrimination on the grounds of gender or race but we cannot have a similar body dealing with discrimination on the grounds of disability. I do not understand why disabled people should get second-class treatment. I do not care whether it is called the commission. The crucial issue is that any piece of legislation must have an enforcement mechanism to remove discrimination. The Bill makes provision for a commission, which has similar powers to those set out in other anti-discrimination legislation. That is in marked contrast to the Government Bill in which, as the Prime Minister said, there is nothing.<br><br>
The key issue in legislation is enforcement. There is no point having legislation that states that we believe discrimination is wrong, that disabled people have rights and that we should do something about those matters if no means exist to advise people of their rights, and to make employers and providers of business services aware of their responsibilities. That structure must exist and there must be a means of achieving conciliation when disputes arise—although heaven forbid that cases reach the courts or industrial tribunals if that can be prevented. The ability to enforce provisions must exist. Such provisions exist in this Bill, unlike the Government Bill, in which there is only blank paper.<br><br>
I hope that all members of the Committee will recognise the importance of a mechanism for providing advice, conciliation and enforcement. A commission or similar body is absolutely essential. I urge the Minister and his colleagues to take on board the point that virtually everyone outside this place has made—that if the Government have an alternative to the Bill and wish to enjoy any credibility at all, they must allow some means of enforcement. Without that, we shall merely be passing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0165">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 135</span>
token legislation, and that would be worse than no legislation at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would have been open to the Government to table a string of amendments on the clause, but they have not done so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would not have been appropriate for the Government to table amendments. They are so fundamentally opposed to the clause that they are against its standing part of the Bill. Had there been masses of amendments, the Bill would have been changed into the Disability Discrimination Bill and we should no longer have been acting within the framework of this Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I always thought that I agreed with the hon. Gentleman on only one issue; there are now two. I echo his analysis. He is right to say that the Government do not want the commission because they want to take the approach outlined in their own Bill.<br><br>
I am at the moment considering a charter for people in the autistic continuum. I have read that two thirds of educational authorities do not make provision for a condition that is generally recognised, although there is not always agreement about its name. Northern Ireland has been accused of making no provision for autistic children in education. What difference would a commission or council make, therefore, if public bodies do not completely meet their statutory public responsibilities? There is no magic wand, although
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 136</span>
opportunities exist for progress. We have an obligation to achieve progress, and I am not convinced that the supporters of the Bill have approached that task in a better way than the Government have.<br><br>
The cultural change underlies the whole debate. We could have made more progress with the Bill if its promoters had not used their particular parliamentary tactics to steamroller through the House issues that involve important matters of detail and principle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Berry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be better if I gave way in our next sitting, because we have only about 25 seconds left, and my comments on the clause will be substantially shorter than those of the hon. Member for Kingswood. We should not spend too much time discussing the commission because the Government will not accept it now or on Report. Instead, we should try to agree about a body that can provide advice and about methods of enforcement. Most important, however, is the cultural acceptance of making progress.</span></p>
