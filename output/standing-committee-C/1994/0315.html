	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I begin, Mr. Hill, by welcoming you to the chairmanship of the Committee? I have previously had the honour and privilege of serving on Committees on which you have been Chairman and I have no doubt that we shall be well served by your chairmanship, all the more so, given that the broad nature of the Bill is uncontroversial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Exeter (Sir J. Hannam), who introduced the Bill in the House on 3 February, is also to be congratulated. He achieved a remarkable success in pushing through the Second Reading debate with considerable speed, with the support of the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche), who is in her place this morning, and with contributions from other hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North (Mr. Heald). I also pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Home Office, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean), whose co-operation and assistance have given the Bill the necessary boost that we all wish it to have. I am also delighted to see other members of the Committee here, including the hon. and Learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell), whose advice during the proceedings will be much valued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the beginning of his speech on Second Reading, my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter said—he apologised for this—that the Bill appeared to be a narrow and fairly technical measure. I beg to differ. Neither is the Bill narrow, nor should it be apologised for. It is a wide-ranging Bill and its parentage, beyond that of its father, my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter, is to be found in two or three earlier Acts, all of which are now in force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is complicated so the Committee should treat it with some care, not least because, daily, practitioners in the courts, be they solicitors, barristers or judges, are increasingly confused by the flood of legislation coming from this place which alters, tinkers with or adjusts the criminal law and its procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that in mind, I remind the Committee of the warning of Lord Justice Rose in the Court of Appeal in which he said that far too much legislation that affects the criminal law is coming forward. He said that practically every year a new Bill is introduced. To give an example of the sort of problems that that creates, I shall show the Committee a copy of the "Crown Court Index 1995". It is a good textbook, written and published by Peter Morrish and Judge Ian MacLean. The great thing about the book is that it says, "Now Annual". This is the 15th edition of the book and it proclaims itself to be "Now Annual". Criminal practitioners in the courts are now required to buy every year a new book to explain the latest developments in the criminal law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, during the Committee proceedings, and while discussing the amendments, we shall be able to bring some clarity where there could be confusion, to bring openness in court procedures where we might be accused of introducing some form of secrecy or lack of candour and to do justice where it might not otherwise be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other part of the background which is relevant to my arguments appears in this morning's edition of 	<i>The Times.</i> It carries an article headed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Colombia's leader blames Europe for cocaine trade boom".</p></blockquote>
Although I appreciate that the Bill and the amendment are not strictly confined to drugs, none the less the Bill arises from the Criminal Justice Act 1988, the Drug Trafficking Act 1994 and the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986. It is, therefore, pertinent to bear in mind the article and what it teaches us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The article is written by Michael Dynes, the Brussels correspondent of 	<i>The Times,</i> and he is reporting on remarks made by the President of the Republic of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0338">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Colombia which, as hon. Members will realise, is one of the major sources of drug production in the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The article states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Europe's external frontier is one of the weakest links in the International effort to stamp out the burgeoning traffic in cocaine, President Samper of Colombia said yesterday.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Cocaine exports will continue to grow until consumer countries recognise that they, not producer countries, are the primary cause of the international drugs problem and have the courage to implement policies to stamp out the trade, President Samper said.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>His indictment of Europe's anti-drug policies coincides with the publication of the latest figures collected by the World Customs Organisation, which show that European seizures of cocaine alone have almost doubled to 20,460 kilos (45,012lbs) over the past year.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Spain and Portugal remain the main gateway for cocaine into Europe, although seizures in Holland, especially Rotterdam, which handles 40 per cent. of Europe's external trade, and Britain, have increased greatly.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The increase comes as most members of the European Union are preparing to abolish internal frontiers. But many critics fear that the new external barrier will be no match for the combination of Colombian cartels, Italian Mafia and East European gangsters, who have set their sights on Europe as the next big market for cocaine.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Señor Samper said Europe would have to spend far greater amounts of money tightening up its external frontiers, educating citizens about the dangers of drug usage, encouraging co-operation with international anti-drug enforcement agencies, and enabling peasant farmers to abandon the cultivation of the coca plant. Only then would Europe avoid developing a drugs problem similar to America's, he said.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>In a clear attempt to shift the blame for the global drugs crisis on to consumer countries. Señor Samper said: 'If there was no consumption, there would be no production.' Countries like Colombia have simply become the 'scapegoats' for the growth in Western drug dependency, he added."</p></blockquote>
I suspect that the President, while he made an honest point, misunderstands what this country and the Government are doing, and what the Bill proposes to do—to break the success of so-called lifestyle crimes, which my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter mentioned in his speech on Second Reading. It is because the Bill directly addresses the question of lifestyle offences that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Clappison 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hertsmere)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. I am listening with great interest to the important point he is making about drug trafficking, about which all hon. Members are very concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does my hon. Friend agree, as he discusses other types of lifestyle crime, that there are many other types of offences and offending which cause equally grave concern, such as the flood of pornography, burglary and the handling of stolen goods, which will be dealt with by the Bill in an equally effective way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do, but I do not want to be sidetracked into dealing with pornography and so forth, although it may be of considerable interest to members of the Committee, in an academic sense. I want to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If an hon. Member gives way, he is asking to be distracted. It is up to the hon. Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) whether he gives way or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is up to me whether I give way, but it is not for me to decide what an intervener
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
will ask. Until I am aware of the question, I cannot possibly make a decision about whether I am to be sidetracked. However, I fully accept the thrust of your advice, Mr. Hill, and I shall look carefully into the eyes of any hon. Members who seek to intervene to find out whether they are intervening in a relevant or in a less helpful way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is easier with some people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman is wearing glasses, which makes it all the more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill and the amendments are timely because of the growing problem of drug use in schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warwickshire, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman accept that Opposition members of the Committee thought that the intervention by his hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) was extremely apt, because the Bill deals primarily with non-drug-related offences, while drug-related offences are dealt with in other legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying, the growing use of drugs in schools is encouraging suppliers not only of illegal drugs, but of illegal and disgusting computer techniques. As we discovered in the Select Committee on Home Affairs, on which some hon. Members present served, there is growing evidence of the exchange of pornographic material on floppy disk or in other computer formats in school playgrounds. The Bill is designed to deal with precisely such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ensure that we do not allow criminals to claim that they have been unfairly dealt with and to escape on a later appeal punishment for offences of which they are properly guilty, and I want to ensure that the profits of those crimes cannot be kept safe for them when all right-minded people would want them to be confiscated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman promises to make a relevant intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is precisely on the point that the hon. Gentleman was just making. He was talking about criminals getting off on appeal. Would he care to comment on the case of Welch 	<i>v.</i> The United Kingdom, decided under the European convention on human rights, which sought to invalidate some of the existing drug trafficking legislation that deals with confiscation? There might be some danger that parts of the Bill could also fall foul of that decision. That is obviously a matter for concern because hon. Members of all parties support the general thrust of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I want to say a word about short interventions. The constant interruptions may be putting the hon. Member of his stroke.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0339">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hill, for your protection. I apologise to the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North (Mr. O'Brien) for being a little short with him. I was worried that your advice would unwittingly be disobeyed by the hon. Gentleman or by me in dealing with his point, which was a good one, but which was probably pertinent to a later clause. I have no doubt that my hon. Friend the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter will bear in mind the fly that the hon. Gentleman has cast across the river.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The text of amendment No. 2 does not need much discussion. The guts of my proposals are to be found in amendment No. 3 which introduces a substitute subsection, (1A), which will go into the Criminal Justice Act 1988. I seek to bring forward from the statement process a preliminary information process so that the defendant is made aware of the broad outline of the case to be brought against him. In effect, that is me equivalent of the service of a writ in civil proceedings as compared with the service of a statement of claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In civil proceedings, one begins by issuing a generally endorsed writ, although it is permissible to serve a writ endorsed with a statement of claim. The writ sets out the general nature of the case which allows the defendant, the responder to the action, to know broadly what is to be alleged against him in the claim. So long as he enters an appearance and acknowledges the writ, the plaintiff—or, in Scotland, the pursuer—is required to serve a statement of claim that sets out in detail the nature of the claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with the Bill is that it does not provide for service of the equivalent of a writ setting out the general case against the defendant, whereas there is provision later for the exchange of statements setting out the detail of the case. It is important to give the defendant greater clarity in relation to the case against him at an earlier stage because of the draconian nature of the remedy that the Bill will provide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Heald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hertfordshire, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following my hon. Friend's analogy with civil procedure, can he see any logical reason why all the steps taken on statements and finding out the nature of the case are dealt with after conviction? Would it not be better, as in civil courts, to deal with such matters at a pre-trial review—to have the procedure in place before conviction, or have the discretion to do so? Then, instead of delays post conviction provided for in the Bill, we could get on with it and have a seamless set of proceedings at the Crown court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some doubts about whether the Crown court is necessarily the best place to carry out that kind of complicated inquiry. One gets involved in all sorts of areas of equitable tracing and so forth when one looks for the proceeds of crime. The courts have the power to look at the life of the defendant over the previous six years and the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
complicated nature of that inquiry may not be something that a magistrates court or Crown court can carry out in a short space of time. In some cases, inquiries into confiscation orders have gone on for two working weeks in court.

If we are to have a complicated procedure, we must start by being clear in letting the defendant know precisely what is the case against him. Clearly, the sooner that is done, the better. The sooner the court has disposed of matters one way or the other, the better it is, not only for the defendant who may have to make an enormous payment as a result of the court's order, but for the administration of justice and the public well-being.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reviewing the intervention of his hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North, has it occurred to the hon. Gentleman that what was suggested might be seen as innovating on the presumption of innocence? If matters relating to confiscation are dealt with before the trial, that is how it may be seen. Furthermore, matters may emerge during the trial which may be of considerable importance in concluding whether confiscation was appropriate. There is thus a strong argument for implementing the confiscation procedure after a person has been found guilty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman makes a good point. The Court of Appeal and the House of Lords deprecated the too-hasty use of split trials. Trying preliminary issues may appear attractive because it is thought that time and costs will be saved. However, it leads up a false or blind alley because the tribunal is left with unfounded facts, mere allegations or suspicion, which require the court of first instance to re-examine. The hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East, illustrates his point from his long experience of the criminal Bar in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the court has discretion to deal with such matters at the pre-trial review. It could be said that that cannot be done if the defendant objects. However, in most civil cases, details of the assessment of damages are prepared well ahead of the trial; the damages may be assessed afterwards, but the ground work has been done. I do not understand why there should be a problem in carrying out financial investigation ahead of the trial. My hon. Friend says that the situation is different in the civil courts; I do not agree. If the assessment of damages is prepared well before the trial and the civil case is lost on liability, it all goes down the Swanee. The preparation work is done ahead of the trial in the interests of speedy justice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem with my hon. Friend's argument is that there is nothing to prevent the parties to the civil action or to the criminal action—the Crown Prosecution Service or the police—from investigating the relevant evidence to discover whether the trafficker or the criminal has a lifestyle that exceeds what his income might, at first blush, appear to be. However, the hon. and learned Member

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
for Fife, North-East and I were referring to inquiry into information and evidence by the court. We would not want a wasted hearing because facts that came out in the criminal trial were not taken into account in a prior inquiry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may not go entirely down the path recommended by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North, but I believe that the matter is worthy of debate. Does my hon. Friend agree that the value of his amendment is that if the notice has been served before the defendant goes to court, he cannot say that it has come as a bombshell, and that he needs time to discuss it with his representatives and to carry out further investigations? Putting the defendant on notice will save time and help with the speedy administration of justice, about which my hon. Friend is rightly concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. With respect, I agree with what my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere said and I draw on my experience at the civil end of the market. In the civil courts, there are requirements that practitioners should exchange skeleton submissions so that controversial matters, beyond those that are revealed in the pleading, can be eliminated. That is the practice now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. I seek your guidance on how the Committee is proceeding and how we might be able to save time. Sometimes the Opposition have to delay business and we have a certain expertise in filibustering. We can recognise an amateurish effort from the Tory Back Benches when we see one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Issues are being raised such as pre-trial reviews which were debated in extenso in the recent Criminal Justice Bill. They are serious issues, but it is difficult to see what they have to do with the amendment or even the Bill. If there are reasons why a Bill which we all expected could go through its full course in Committee this morning needs to be delayed, perhaps because specific amendments have to be prepared and be in order, the Committee could surely order its business in such a way to allow that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could perhaps adjourn this morning and return for another sitting next week without having to listen to a great deal of argument that is not germane to the Bill or the amendments. It would allow hon. Members to get on with their business and return with relevant amendments at a later stage. We came here this morning to deal with some tight amendments, thinking that agreement could be reached within a matter of minutes on a Bill which is important and which has been brought forward in a very proper way by the hon. Member for Exeter. It has the support of the Minister, the Government and both Opposition parties. We are bemused about why we are being treated to a lengthy discourse on a matter which does not appear to be in dispute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) first before we get into a series of points of order. My only reservation is that at some stage I must throw the amendment open to debate. At the moment I am unable to do so. The proceedings are in order. If the hon. Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) wishes to pursue his amendment until 1 pm, I cannot stop him. On the other hand, I appeal to him to complete his opening address on the amendment. I can then open the debate to everyone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no wish to exclude anyone from the debate. If hon. Members wish to contribute, I shall be delighted. I am concerned that we should not enact legislation that will later have to be amended or brought back to the House of Commons for correction. I mentioned the "Crown Court Index 1995" to demonstrate the dangers that inappropriate discussion of complicated legislation can create. In 1992, I sat on the then Criminal Justice Bill which corrected the mistakes of the 1991 Bill. I would hope that for once, and I mean no disrespect to the other members of the Committee, we could stop being rubber stamps and could get down to discussing the issues behind the proposed legislation. The public would then have greater confidence in the legislation thus produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Practitioners at the criminal Bar are not always as confident about the quality of the legislation that we pass as we might wish. If we are to enact this Bill, which is admirable in its theory, in a form which meets the justice of the case we should discuss the amendment with some care. I fully understand that Members on both sides of the Committee disagree with the point that I am making. They may find it boring. They may find it inconvenient to listen to me advancing my case on the amendment. But there are others—members of the general public—who expect parliamentarians to deal with legislation carefully and not allow it to be pushed through without proper consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. We are now getting gratuitous comments from the hon. Gentleman, who is not advancing a case relating to the amendments. Although the Committee has been constituted on non-partisan lines because of the nature of the Bill, I think that I can speak for everyone on the Opposition Benches. We are quite prepared to listen to the arguments for the amendments and to the response of the hon. Member for Exeter, but the salient points could be exhausted in a matter of minutes. We could then deal responsibly with the issues. That would be efficiency in legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the backs of the minds of hon. Members who are listening to a lot of hot air and waffle, there is the suspicion that the hon. Gentleman is indulging his wish to prevent other private Members' Bills—perhaps the Wild Mammals (Protection) Bill or another—from coming into Committee. That is why he is making such an inadequate fist of moving the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0341">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I can criticise in any way what is a perfectly orderly Committee. The hon. Member for Harborough has the Floor and probably wishes to finalise his opening remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Hill. I will not descend to crossing swords with the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) because that would be unworthy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat my point that unless we deliberate on these matters properly, we shall produce the wrong sort of law. It is all very well for hon. Members to say that we can deal with this amendment briefly and in a few seconds. That may be right. However, if we are to deal with it properly, we should take the time and trouble to study what we are doing. This is a most complicated Bill that has been drawn from other legislation. The English in it requires considerable care. It is rather tiresome that the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth should complain when I move an amendment that seeks to improve the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now deal with the detail of the amendment. Subsection (1A) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A copy of any notice under subsection (1)(a) above shall be provided to the offender not later than seven days after it is sent to the court; and the notice shall contain such information as will enable the offender to be aware of the main facts upon which the prosecutor intends to rely in seeking to persuade the court that it would be appropriate for it to proceed under this section."</p></blockquote>
That is the broad outline of the argument. The prosecutor should have to tell not only the court but the defendant that he or the prosecution service has a case to put against the defendant. That is entirely sensible and a matter of natural justice. The man against whom an order may be made should be informed at the earliest possible time that it is to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1B) goes further. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the court decides, in accordance with subsection (1)(b) above, that it would be appropriate for it to proceed under this section without a written notice from the prosecutor, it shall as soon as practicable provide to the offender a statement summarising the reasons for its decision."</p></blockquote>
The prosecutor or the court may decide that there is an appropriate prima facie case. In either case, the defendant must be informed, and with sufficient clarity so that he is made aware of the main facts upon which the prosecutor intends to rely. Those facts include the nature of the proceeds that the defendant is alleged to have amassed and their whereabouts and value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1C) would provide:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The court shall not take any action in pursuance of a written notice from the prosecutor under subsection (1) above until the offender has acknowledged receipt of a copy of the notice; provided that after the period of fourteen days has elapsed beginning with the date of sending of a copy of the notice to the offender, the court may presume, in the absence of any communication from him, that he has received the copy of the notice."</p></blockquote>
In many cases, the recipient of the notice would be in
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
prison or would be represented by solicitors, so there would be no difficulty in serving the notice so as to ensure actual rather than constructive knowledge of it. In other cases, however, defendants might have absconded or deliberately absented themselves. The court should not for that reason be precluded from inquiring into their fortunes. That is why the amendment would introduce the saving provision to allow the court to proceed in the absence of offenders or any communication from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a way of going about things is not new or strange. It is used in civil proceedings. If a defendant does not acknowledge service of a writ, the plaintiff may enter judgment in default of acknowledgment. If the defendant acknowledges the writ but fails to respond to the statement of claim, the plaintiff can proceed in default of defence. I am not introducing into the Bill a procedure that is alien to the law. My amendment would introduce clarity, more obvious justice and openness—three characteristics that I hope hon. Members would welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly about the amendments, which are the first to be considered by the Committee. I congratulate the hon. Member for Exeter on the place that he achieved in the private Members' ballot and on presenting a useful Bill, with the support of my hon. Friends the Members for Stockport (Ms Coffey) and for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell). It is a cross-party measure which should be supported by consensus in the House of Commons. In some ways it is almost a Government Bill. That is a serious point because precious private Members' time is being used to achieve something that the Government could have done. That is not a criticism of the hon. Member for Exeter. Indeed, I hope that during the lifetime of the Committee—which appears likely to be longer than any of us expected—he will be drawing a ministerial salary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I endorse the general comments that were made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green on Second Reading, which outlined our support for the Bill. I know that the Minister shares that view of it. We welcome the extension of powers of confiscation of the proceeds of crime, and welcome intervention aimed at rendering effectual previously ineffectual means of tackling the scandal of the lifestyle of some of crime's beneficiaries. In particular, we welcome the removal of the £10,000 limit and the placing of a duty on courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall want to clarify certain matters with the Minister, in particular, during the debate. A reference has been made to the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in the Welch case. It would help the Committee if the Minister were to clarify that decision, which impinges on the entire Bill. The fly cast across the river, as this was described earlier, is cast by the European Court of Human Rights rather than the Opposition. It would assist us if we knew the Government's views on the implications of that decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0342">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
The amendments seem to be detailed drafting amendments. We shall listen with interest to what the hon. Member for Exeter says about the amendments before we come down for or against them. There is an element of technicality about the amendments: their intention seems to be a reasonable tidying up, but there may be implications that the Committee should consider seriously before accepting them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the responsible way to deal with amendments. Some of my hon. Friends may wish to comment on them after the hon. Member for Exeter has made his position clear. However, we should be able to move forward quickly and responsibly on the Bill and the specific amendments to it because of the broad and positive consensus that the Bill enjoys.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hertfordshire, North is not the promoter of the Bill. Sir John Hannam.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Hannam 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Exeter)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hill, for calling me at this stage. I was planning to listen to any other comments before responding, but, at your invitation, I shall deal with the points raised by the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I am pleased to be introducing the Bill, especially because of the cross-party support that it received on Second Reading. Secondly, I am delighted that you are our Chairman, Mr. Hill. I know from previous experience that you will conduct our affairs with good humour and fairness—and stern discipline!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill would strengthen our law-and-order system by extending to all crimes the existing confiscation provisions which are applied to drug trafficking offences. As my hon. Friend the Member for Harborough said, this may appear to be a narrow and technical measure, but it is none the less ambitious. Not being a lawyer, I know that your guidance will be extremely valuable to me, Mr. Hill, if I become too deeply embroiled in legal debates with hon. and learned Members on both sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 2 and 3, moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Harborough, would unnecessarily complicate and delay the confiscation procedures under part VI of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. Therefore, I cannot support them. In the early part of his speech, my hon. Friend referred to drug traffickers. However, there are no equivalent provisions to the ones that he proposes in the drug trafficking legislation and, in general, the Bill mirrors that legislation. Therefore, the amendments would impose different requirements on the court, depending on the type of offence for which someone was being tried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the law stands, and is intended to have effect after the Bill comes into force, the prosecutor can commence the confiscation procedures by tendering
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
written evidence to the court. The defendant should not be able to contest whether the proceedings are to commence, as he or she already has a locus in the confiscation procedures and can contest a number of matters before a confiscation order is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was some debate about which court should deal with the confiscation details. The Crown court was selected as the best court to deal with confiscation matters. In considering the offences, the court will, in most instances, already be in possession of information about the proceeds from the offences. It would be much more costly to refer the confiscation hearing after sentence to the county court or the High Court. Hence the specific reference in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have noted the reasons for my hon. Friend the Member for Harborough tabling the amendment, but, as I see it, by virtue of the proposed new subsection (1A), the defendant would be given grounds to contest the prosecutor's notice. That would add a further stage to already complicated confiscation procedures, which would have cost implications for the courts. That is hardly sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the procedures envisaged by the proposed new subsection (1B), the court would be serving notice of its reasons for deciding to move on the defendant of its own volition after it has made the decision. There seems no purpose in creating that requirement where the court has already made a decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend help me by confirming one point? The proposed new subsection (1A) in line 22 reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The court shall first determine whether the offender has benefited from any relevant criminal conduct."</p></blockquote>
Would that be an inter parte hearing—with the defendant present—or ex parte, one-sided, whereby the court would make an inquiry by itself about the conduct to be examined?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Hannam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm that it would be an inter parte matter, with the defendant present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems no purpose in creating the new requirement under the proposed subsection (1B) in circumstances where the court has already made its decision. If, however, the purpose of the amendment is to render contestable the court's decision to move of its own volition, I cannot accept the amendment for the reason that I have given. It would cause further unnecessary complications to require the court—as the proposed new subsection (1C) suggests—to serve a copy of the prosecutor's notice on the defendant. I can reassure my hon. Friend generally that there is no question of confiscation proceedings taking place without the defendant's knowledge. For example, where the prosecutor is tendering a statement under drug trafficking measures in part VI of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, rules of court require a copy of the statement to be served on the defendant. When
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0343">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
confiscation proceedings are triggered, the defendant will have ample opportunity to contest them. We shall discuss on later clauses the various ways in which that can be done. For those reasons, I cannot support my hon. Friend's amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems that the present purpose of the notice, as written in the Bill, is to trigger the procedure set out more fully in the proposed new subsection (1A). The amendment raises the question whether the notice should be simply a trigger for the procedure, or whether it should have a greater purpose. That raises another question about the timing and nature of the notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are important issues. It would, of course, mean a departure from the present scheme of things if the notice were to be more than just a trigger, and be dealt with as the amendment proposes. However, that may not be a bad thing. One great improvement in the criminal justice system in the past few years has been the attempt to make the justice system more speedy and more transparent, and to curtail the time before trial, at trial, after trial and before disposal. It may be that improving the notice and expanding its nature will make it possible to achieve a good deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us recall the way in which changes have occurred. When I began prosecuting, the nature of charges brought in criminal proceedings was often extremely vague: one was taught to be bold and succinct, and leave one's options open, but the courts have rather caught up with us. In recent cases, the Court of Appeal has said that it is only right that full particulars of the charge should be given. Last year it decided that
	<br><blockquote><p>"an application should be made to the court for an order requiring the prosecution to give such further particulars as may be necessary to enable the defence to know the case that it has to meet … In some cases it may be appropriate for the judge to direct the giving of such further particulars even though no application is made."</p></blockquote>
The movement in the criminal justice system has been towards providing more information and having a more transparent process—a move closer to the civil procedures with which my hon. Friend the Member for Harborough is so familiar. The defence is required to reveal in advance, the expert evidence on which it may rely, and the system of pre-trial reviews has enabled the courts to have a much clearer idea at a much earlier stage of what is alleged and what the issues will be at the trial. Since 1977, counsel has been expected to be able to inform the court at a pre-trial review of the pleas to be tendered, the prosecution witnesses required, additional witnesses, facts that can be or are admitted, the probable length of the trial, the exhibits, the schedules, the issues and the points of law, among other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That has had a beneficial effect, because instead of spending hours and sometimes days during a trial arguing about points of law and scurrying off during a short adjournment to see whether an admission can be cobbled together to save time, the whole business can
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
be dealt with in a tidy way before the proceedings are heard. That move towards the civil approach—in effect there are pleadings because the indictment is subject to particulars and discovery, and because the prosecution must disclose its unused material, and inspection—is to the good and has improved the procedure in criminal courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme of the post-conviction procedure, involving a notice by the prosecutor followed by directions for a statement and a reply, is all well and good but it delays matters because all the work has to be done after conviction. That makes it necessary to have a specific section in legislation to deal with postponement of determinations, because if the triggering event post conviction is the conviction plus a notice, the system has suddenly to gear up towards obtaining the necessary information to deal with the procedure for confiscation. I am willing to admit that the Bill is admirable in every way but I feel that it is right, on a probing amendment, to consider whether we can improve the post-conviction procedure by moving at least part of the work forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter that could be dealt with at the pretrial review is whether the prosecution will be serving a notice and, if it will, whether it needs to be a notice as simple as that envisaged in the Bill. Would not it be possible for the prosecution to give a good deal of the information that, under section 3 of the Drug Trafficking Act 1994 or clause 3 of the Bill, would be in the statement, at that early stage? If it is possible, why should there be a notice and then a statement? Why could not the notice include a good deal of that information, as suggested by the amendment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The procedure would then be that there would be an indictment, which would include the charge, subject to particulars, if necessary. Then there would be the notice of confiscation, given at an early stage, possible prior to pre-trial review, setting out the prosecution case on confiscation: the details of qualifying previous convictions, in so far as they are known; the proposed TICs, if known; the property transferred to the defendant during the prior six years, if known; the expenditure and the valuations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be said that it would be impractical to give that information at that early stage, but I believe that there are many accused who would say, "I am having a trail on count 1 or 2, but I shall plead guilty on count 3 or 4. I may have to have a trial, but I would not mind having a lot of the investigative work, if it must be done, undertaken at an earlier stage." I am not saying that that should be mandatory but I wonder whether discretion could rest with the court, perhaps even by agreement between the parties, to deal with some of the investigations at an early stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be said that police time would be unnecessarily tied up in investigations which might not prove fruitful. If discretion is given to the judge, even if it is subject to agreement between the parties, I do not believe that that criticism holds water. In a case
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0344">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
in which there will be a trial on some counts but not on others, that provision might be a useful way of speeding up the process. It would proceed in an almost seamless way from the trial in front of the jury into the investigation and determination of the question of confiscation, rather than having to postpone the issue for weeks and end up having a hearing months later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that sentence can be passed, followed by postponement and a later hearing. I am not saying that that postpones sentence, but it does postpone final disposal. There may be defendants who would prefer to get the proceedings over with and have the preparatory work done in advance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East said that the provision would impinge on civil liberties, because the defendant would not yet have been convicted and, in a way, the provision would impeach the criminal justice system. If there were a mandatory requirement to follow the procedure that I am suggesting, there might be some truth in that. But if it were to be part of the practice directions of the court that, on a pre-trial review, those matters could be dealt with in advance, I do not believe that that civil liberties argument would hold much water. There is no reason why that investigative work could not be done at an earlier stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question would arise of the powers that would be needed to get the proper information before the court. It is noticeable that the weakness in the Drug Trafficking Offences Act, which was also seen in the Criminal Justice Act 1988 by the Home Office working group on confiscation, was that, during an investigation into the defendant's financial situation, onus was on the prosecution to gather the information necessary for the preparation of the financial statement. The defendant, or prospective defendant, was not compelled to disclose any details of his or her assets and, as a result, defendants were asked about their assets after charge and remained silent on legal advice, which impaired the effectiveness of the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 1991 report on the Drug Trafficking Offences Act, the working group put forward a proposal that the court should have a power to require the defendant in drug trafficking cases to provide, within a specified period, sufficient information to assist in determining whether there had been a benefit, the amount of it, and the realisable assets. Amendments followed—I sat on the Committee, as did others in this Room—which allowed those powers to be used to ensure that the information was available. This Bill includes such powers in later clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that it would not be right to impose those powers before conviction because that would impinge on civil liberties. But if the new notice was a statement and if there were a possibility of a fast-track approach, as I have suggested, one would not have all the powers that the Bill makes available at that early stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
The Committee should consider the relationship between the defendant's attitude to the procedure and his sentence. In cases such as Regina 	<i>v.</i> Nicholson, it has been said that it is wrong to put undue pressure on a defendant to co-operate in an inquiry of this sort. However, I believe that many judges would take the attitude that a defendant who was prepared to co-operate should be allowed some credit. If we consider the amendment as probing and aimed at finding the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter and my hon. Friend the Minister of State, is not there some room for a discretionary direction, set down in practice rather than in statute, which would allow a fast-track procedure? A lot of investigatory work could then be done in advance and the defendant could be given credit in his sentence if he was prepared to co-operate. That would speed up the justice system, and would provide for a seamless trial and a follow-on procedure of confiscation while avoiding the difficulties of constant postponements and delays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the amendment suggests that
	<br><blockquote><p>"a copy of any notice under subsection (1)(a) above shall be provided to the offender not later than seven days after it is sent to the court—"</p></blockquote>
rules of court already provide for service—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and the notice shall contain such information as will enable the offender to be aware of the main facts".</p></blockquote>
I suggest that the notice may contain all matters that the statement may contain
	<br><blockquote><p>"upon which the prosecutor intends to rely in seeking to persuade the court that it would be appropriate for it to proceed under this section."</p></blockquote>
There is, of course, no question of the court considering that. Once the trigger is pulled by notice being served, the court has no option and must determine the issue. I could not support the amendment as it stands, but I ask my hon. Friends to consider whether there is some point here that should be further looked into.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that we are dealing with two conflicting public policies? One is the need to protect the public from criminals of the sort who will be trapped by the Bill and the previous legislation. The other is the conflicting policy of not placing on defendants the burden of proving their innocence. It is the job of the state and the prosecution to prove criminal conduct beyond reasonable doubt. I am acutely aware of the nice, difficult balancing act that that requires. However, would my hon. Friend agree that when imposing confiscatory powers on a defendant, we have to tread carefully in judging how to treat a defendant who is to face such complicated charges?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree. One of the difficulties with the procedure is that when courts proceed to sentence, the test is whether the facts on which sentencing is based are established beyond reasonable doubt. When it comes to confiscation, the test is the civil test of the balance of probabilities. That is a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0345">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
difficult issue. If, as I have said, one gives a defendant who co-operates in confiscation proceedings credit for that, one might impinge on sentencing which should be dealt with only in the manner suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a potential problem in the nature of the proceedings. The problem is worth grasping and wrestling with, because there are benefits of having this sort of legislation and being able to say to an accused person, "Look, you've got this record of criminality; you are a lifestyle criminal; you have had your opportunities in the past. Now we're going to go through all your income and assets for the last six years and take them from you unless you can provide an explanation, the assumptions having been made." That is such a powerful threat to a defendant that it must affect his behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a way, that is akin to "three strikes and you're out", because to qualify for the treatment under the Bill a number of offences have to be taken into account or there has to be history of offending. Once a person has that, the court is able to look back over six years and to make assumptions about his offending in that period, and treat income as coming from offences that have never been proved—it is a serious measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, it is right that defendants should have that threat hanging over them. I was always a great supporter of at least the idea of an extended sentence, which had a similar logic behind it. It is right that there should be such penalties, but I accept that there are juristic difficulties in coming to terms with exactly how a court should approach those difficult issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards subsection (1B), I am not sure why it would be necessary for the court to give reasons to the offender for it proceeding in such a way of its own motion. Clearly, it is necessary to have some sort of trigger post-conviction for the process to take place. The written notice does not involve any discussion of the merits of proceeding or any argument about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as the court's view is concerned, it has to believe only that it would be appropriate to proceed. If the court were required to give detailed reasons for the appropriateness of that course, a range of possible appeals would be opened up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. David Maclean)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall briefly take the opportunity to respond to a couple of points and give the Government's view on the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I was asked about the Welch case. Hon. Members may know that the European Court of Human Rights ruled on 9 February that the United Kingdom had violated article 7 of the European convention on human rights in the case of the convicted drug trafficker, Welch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Welch was convicted in 1988 of offences committed in 1986. A confiscation order was made against him on 15 September 1988 under the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986, which came into force on 12 January 1987.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom has always argued—we argued most strenuously before the European Court of Human Rights—that a confiscation order made in England and Wales is not a penalty and, therefore, the law can be applied retrospectively. That particular court, however, took a different view and opined that the confiscation order, in the circumstances of Welch's case, was a penalty and that, as it was applied retrospectively in respect of conduct carried out before the 1986 Act came into force, there was a breach of article 7 of the convention. Those are the facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members will realise, the judgment concerned a very narrow issue. We are currently considering very carefully the full implications of the Welch judgment and shall make our views known in due course, as soon as we possibly and reasonably can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unable to say at this stage whether it will be necessary to seek the agreement of my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter to any amendments to be made to the Bill as a consequence of the judgment. However, any amendments would be reasonably minor; they would not be too serious or go to the heart of the Bill. That is all that I can say on the Welch case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North asked whether we could do anything if the offender co-operates and, perhaps, have a special procedure in the rules of court. It is highly unlikely that an offender would co-operate. After all, he is pleading not guilty. It is difficult to maintain a defence and plead not guilty while at the same time saying, "However, my cash is stashed in the Cayman islands".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes the point in an amusing way. However, offenders often have a record of offending that comes before the court. They may plead guilty to some offences, but on others they may decide to fight. In those circumstances, there may be any number of qualifying offences available in which the defendant has pleaded guilty and the investigative work can be done in advance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be. However, in many cases, it would be prohibitively expensive to do much
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0346">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
of the investigative work in advance and the person may still be found not guilty on some key offences. The system loses nothing in doing the investigative work after the conviction has been gained. We see no great benefit from doing otherwise. If an offender wishes to co-operate, he can do so. There is nothing to stop him doing so. In many cases, it would probably mean his pleading guilty. Co-operation might be seen as mitigation and the court can take that into account in its sentencing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions in clause 1 mirror amendments made to the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986 by the Criminal Justice Act 1993 and now consolidated in the Drug Trafficking Act 1994. Like the amendments to the drug trafficking legislation, the provisions in clause 1 are designed to streamline confiscation procedures, held under part VI of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, to make them operate more quickly and more efficiently. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter. I am satisfied that the defendant's interests are already safeguarded under those provisions. The proposed amendments are not necessary. The Government will not support them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter on piloting the Bill through Second Reading and through the House. It is a complex Bill. Its aims are straightforward and common sense and have all-party agreement. Unfortunately, those aims involve complex amendments to existing legislation. I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter is in that seat rather than me. A ministerial salary would not make him very much better off, so I have no intention of handing over my meagre portion. My hon. Friend was wise to pick such an important measure. The Government support the Bill and we shall give my hon. Friend help and assistance. If the Bill reaches the statute book, it will be a triumph for my hon. Friend—more of a triumph, perhaps, than choosing a Bill that does not receive all-party support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Barbara Roche 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hornsey and Wood Green)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have listened to the Minister and to the hon. Member for Exeter. We are not persuaded that the amendments are necessary. The necessary procedures to safeguard the interests of the defendant and to ensure that the wheels of justice move as quickly as possible appear in clause 1. For that reason, we shall not support the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Members who have taken part in the debate. I understand the misgivings of my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter and I am aware of the lack of support for my amendment from all quarters. I have listened to the arguments, and I hope that those who do not support the amendment have listened to mine. We can perhaps consider these matters again at a later stage and my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter could have discussions with officials in the Home Office to tinker with the way in which the Bill is drafted. It is, as my hon. Friend the Minister said, a highly complicated matter. It is not made easier by the fact that we are lowering a new piece of legislation on to an old piece of legislation
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
which has grown out of a great deal of public concern. Having heard what has been said this morning, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Hannam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to those hon. Members who have contributed to the debate. We have dealt with some fairly important aspects of the Bill. The debate was well worth while. As the clause is not freestanding and, like most other clauses, amends an earlier piece of legislation—part VI of the Criminal Justice Act 1988—it might help if I said a little about the purpose of the provision and the thinking behind it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under part VI of the 1988 Act as it stands, a confiscation order may be made only where the prosecutor serves written notice and the court considers that it ought to make an order. The court thus has discretion whether it makes a confiscation order at all, whatever the circumstances of the case. The evidence is that not many cases of confiscation have been successfully carried through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Home Office working group report on the Act, which is available to hon. Members if they wish to have a copy, states in paragraph 2.5 that judges have exercised their discretion on many occasions not to make a confiscation order despite the prosecutor having tendered notice to the effect that, in his opinion, there was sufficient reason and available realisable assets to merit making such an order. That is one of the failings of the previous legislation which my bill seeks to correct by strengthening the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 amends those existing provisions and brings them into line with arrangements in the drug trafficking confiscation legislation. Where the prosecutor serves notice, the court will now be required to determine whether the defendant has benefited from crime and, if so, to make a confiscation order. As in the drug trafficking legislation, the court will have the power to proceed of its own volition where the prosecutor does not serve notice. Under existing procedures, the court is not obliged, where it does decide to make an order under part VI of the Act, to confiscate the total amount of the defendant's proceeds of crime, even though there may be sufficient realisable property available for the payment of a confiscation order in the full amount. That seems wrong in principle. The whole of the defendant's proceeds should be confiscated whenever a confiscation order is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 therefore also abolishes the discretion of the court to make an order for an amount lower than the defendant's proceeds, subject always to there being sufficient realisable property available to satisfy the order. That involves a great deal of investigation which hinges on the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Harborough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0347">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
Care has been taken to safeguard the interests of victims under the new procedures. The court will retain the discretion accorded to it by section 72(3) of the 1988 Act not to make a confiscation order where a victim has instituted or intends to institute civil proceedings against the defendant. We have talked about the criminal—the defendant—but probably the most important person in the case is the victim. Where the victim has instituted, or has declared an intention to institute, civil proceedings against the defendant, the discretion lies with the court not to make a confiscation order. In such cases, the court would have a power rather than a duty to make such an order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that is worth making here concerns the relationship between compensation orders and confiscation orders. They are not directly related except that the court reaching a decision about a compensation order, with the information from investigation of the realised assets at its disposal, will be able to make a much more realistic compensation order for the victims. An indirect benefit, therefore, exists for the victims of crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, clause 1 would abolish the £10,000 minimum currently applicable to confiscation orders under the 1988 Act. The scheme as it stands effectively does not permit confiscation orders to be made against criminals unless the prosecutor can establish at the outset that benefits from the offences before the court exceed £10,000 and that the defendant's realisable property is worth more than that. That figure is important in that it bears a relationship to the cost of obtaining a confiscation order. It was established to avoid the making of small or minimal confiscation orders, with all the attendant work. My understanding is that the provisions have caused practical difficulties in respect of the prosecuting authority's ability to obtain a restraint order because the High Court must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for thinking that a confiscation order will be made. That depends on an assessment of whether the proceeds and realisable property are thought to exceed £10,000 in value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully recognise that the confiscation procedures have resource implications for the courts, so I would not expect most confiscation orders to be made for sums of £10,000 or less. Most will continue to be made for larger amounts. However, the prosecutors and courts must have the power on occasion to confiscate smaller amounts, where the facts of the case make it appropriate. I imagine that hon. Members' constituency postbags will reveal that constituents suffer from the activities of fraudsters and others. If sums such as £8,000 or £9,000 are involved and definite hardship has been caused, the court might want the power to enforce a compensation order. The legislation would allow that, so victims of such robberies and frauds are likely particularly to welcome the change. In conjunction with clause 2, which we shall shortly consider, clause 1 will comprise a credible package for tightening the basic elements of confiscation procedures in the 1988 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on clause 1. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter first on having chosen the measure that we are debating for his private Members' Bill. It has wide support in the House, but will also interest many of our constituents, particularly those who have been victims of crime. I also congratulate my hon. Friend on piloting the Bill through Second Reading and on his clear and cogent explanation this morning of the operation of clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 improves and streamlines existing provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 1988. I strongly agree with my hon. Friend's remarks about the minimum amount in the legislation. He gave a clear exposition of the original reasons for setting a minimum and of why it should now be changed. He is right to stress that courts and prosecutors should be allowed maximum flexibility in applying the legislation, and should not confront an arbitrary hurdle of £10,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agreed with my hon. Friend's remarks about wanting to deal with the larger-scale lifestyle criminals. It occurred to me with regard to measuring the benefit that accrues to criminals from their offences that we should remember that that benefit might represent only a fraction of the value of the victims' loss. Criminals who handle stolen property are often casual about disposing of it for small amounts, but £10,000 might represent extremely valuable property to the victims of crime. They might be very pleased that £9,000 of benefit was rightly confiscated from the criminal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what my hon. Friend said about compensation orders. In many cases, it will not be possible to identify victims and to award them compensation. It will be clear, however, that the proceeds are the result of criminal conduct and it is, therefore, right that they should be taken away from the criminals, even though a victim cannot be identified, and the proceeds thus returned to the owner by way of a compensation order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is for the prosecution to pull the trigger by giving written notice to the court that it is appropriate to proceed under this section. To what extent does my hon. Friend feel that the prosecutor should take account of the costs of the process of confiscation in taking that decision? Should that be taken into account in deciding whether it is appropriate to proceed, or should the prosecutor simply work on the basis of whether the criminal qualifies and has a track record of a particular kind of lifestyle crime?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has pre-empted my second point about the enhanced role of the prosecution in clause 1. It was dealt with fully by my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter. I agree with the sentiment behind my hon. Friend's intervention that prosecutors should bear in mind the natural and great desire of victims and the public in general to ensure that criminals do not benefit from the proceeds of these offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0348">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
Clause 1 changes the position of the prosecutor; under the Criminal Justice Act 1988—the old section 71—it was for the courts to decide whether a confiscation order should be made. The role of the prosecution was confined under section 72 of that Act to giving written notice to satisfy the court that if an order were to be made, the offender would be able to pay the minimum amount. Clause 1 changes that in that the prosecutor is given the opportunity to trigger the process. Subsection (1B) allows the court to do that, but it places the power to take the initiative in the hands of the prosecution. That is a highly desirable development and I hope that it will be seen, in the context of the Bill, as an attack upon lifestyle criminals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the heart of the Bill is the realisation that lifestyle criminals contribute a great deal to the crime statistics; they cause much suffering and loss to our constituents. A small number of criminals generate an enormous proportion of crime. Research carried out by the Home Office into the number of offences committed by a sample of men aged 35 found, disturbingly, that 35 per cent. of males will have a conviction by that age. Of that 35 per cent., however, most get into trouble only once or twice. The research found that relatively few offenders accounted for a large proportion of convictions. Only 7 per cent. of males who had been convicted of six or more offences accounted for 65 per cent. of convictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It occurs to me that there are some people who choose crime as a life style. It is not as if they have strayed into trouble, fallen on hard times, been led astray or had a lapse in judgment once or twice. Instead, they have set out on a life of crime. Those who calculate the losses and gains that they will make as a result of a life of crime should know that they will not be allowed to get away with living on the proceeds of their crimes and that action will be taken against them to confiscate those proceeds. I believe that clause 1 sends that message to criminals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief in an effort to ensure that the Committee gives the Bill a swift passage. I declare an interest as a parliamentary adviser to the Police Federation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Bill and congratulate the hon. Member for Exeter on giving us the opportunity to put on the statute book a measure which will go a long way towards deterring criminals from continuing with their life style. It will receive tremendous public support because for far too long, the public have felt that Parliament has not responded effectively to their concern about crime and the way that criminals appear to be getting away with it. The Bill will, to some extent, enable us to remedy the public concern about the way that Parliament deals with crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will receive support from the Opposition. Our policy is to be tough on crime and the causes of crime, and this measure will certainly be tough on
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
those who make a career of crime. It is right to be tough on them—that is what the public want. Therefore, I hope that the Bill will complete its Committee stage quickly, and that there will be no long unnecessary speeches. Perhaps Conservative Members will take their lead from this short speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Shersby 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Uxbridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North, I declare my interest as a parliamentary adviser to the Police Federation. In congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter on introducing this valuable Bill. He has given me the opportunity, unusually, to sit on the Conservative Benches and say a few words in support of the commendable initiative that he has taken following his success in the ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change in clause 1 to impose a duty on the court is extremely welcome. It will do a great deal to reassure the public, who have become increasingly concerned about the huge sums of money stashed away by the criminal fraternity who engage in criminal activities such as drug trafficking. It is good to see that Parliament is alive to that concern and is taking the necessary action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the abolition of the £10,000 minimum, which is currently applicable to confiscation orders. In that way, a realistic amount can be confiscated. I also support the provision which imposes a duty on the courts to make a confiscation order and does not leave that to the courts' volition. Public opinion demands that the courts are placed under such a duty so that people who benefit from the serious criminal activities in which they are engaged can no longer have access to their funds after they have served their sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly interested in the way in which the Bill would benefit the victims of crime. I think that all of us who take an interest in the terrible plight of victims of such crimes will feel that way. As president of the Uxbridge victim support scheme, I know that the contents of the Bill will be most carefully noted and studied by the members of its committee, who I am sure will give the Bill their full support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Exeter is joining the ranks of those of us who have been lucky enough to win places in the ballot and to introduce extremely complicated and complex legislation. I wish my hon. Friend every possible success. I fully support the clause and I hope that the Bill will make good progress through its Committee stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Exeter has set out very clearly the intentions behind clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The origin of the clause lies in the Home Office working group report, to which my hon. Friend made reference. The report recommended that it should be mandatory for the court, rather than discretionary as at present, to make a confiscation order in respect of an offence to which part VI of the 1988 Act applies where written notice was tendered by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0349">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
the prosecution—save in particular specified circumstances. A similar provision was introduced in respect of drug trafficking in section 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 and is now included in section 2 of the Drug Trafficking Act 1994, which came into force on 3 February 1995. It is obviously desirable that drug trafficking legislation and all crime legislation should be as closely aligned as possible in that respect. Consequently, the Government fully support the change proposed by my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend also points out, new section 71(1C), inserted by clause 1(2), recognises the special position of victims. That is not, of course, directly relevant to the drug trafficking legislation, although there are many indirect victims of that crime. For the generality of crime, a victim's position must be preserved so that where any loss, injury or damage was caused as a result of the offence or offences, and compensation is being sought through the civil court simultaneously, the compensation is not swallowed up in the confiscation order. The court will, in those circumstances, have discretion whether to make an order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is one of the points of detail which are most important and I am glad that the Minister has referred to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain the mechanism? Is the intention to protect the sum that a victim might gain—in other words, that the sum that the victim would receive would not be swallowed up—but still to be able to confiscate other assets? I ask because it might be possible for the sum that would be awarded to the victim to be smaller than the amount that would be confiscated. In those circumstances, would it be open to the court to make an order which would be net of any award to the victim?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the intention. It is highly likely that the amount of compensation to any one victim would be less than the net assets. Of course, a lot of the assets may have been spent, but a life style criminal is bound to have accumulated, at one time, more than any one victim has lost. It would be the intention to preserve the fund so that the victim could get his or her fair share of compensation and then the courts could get access to the remainder.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause makes allowance for the possibility that the victim has already sought compensation or might intend to seek compensation. In the latter case, would the court make an order for confiscation which said that a sum be indicated, less any compensation that is awarded to the victim? I want to be precise about that particular mechanism. It is clear from the Minister's first response that his intentions are as I hoped. I should be grateful if he would clarify that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that five-second filibuster to allow him to read the other side of his notes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
The court can make both a confiscation and a compensation order and if there are insufficient funds to meet both, the compensation order takes precedence. The victim will receive the appropriate share and the rest is forfeited to the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to comment finally and briefly on the decision to abolish the £10,000 threshold, which was mentioned by a few hon. Members. As hon. Members will know, no such threshold applies in either the drug trafficking or the terrorism legislation. It was introduced in the 1988 Act because the potential for making confiscation orders in respect of crimes generally, beyond drug trafficking, was obviously much greater and there was concern that the power might be used in respect of very minor cases, which would have unjustifiable cost implications for the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have considered the proposal of my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter very carefully and have consulted colleagues in other Departments that have an interest. I am pleased to be able to confirm that, as a result of that consultation, the Government can now fully support the abolition of the threshold which was previously imposed, and which we vigorously defended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prosecuting authorities are considering whether it would be helpful to issue guidelines to their prosecutors to ensure that confiscation is pursued only in viable or in straightforward cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends will agree that, while it would be nice in all circumstances if criminals did not keep their ill-gotten gains, it would be pointless for the taxpayer to spend £8,000 in confiscation proceedings to recover £500 or £1,000. That would be cutting off our nose to spite our face. However, we are considering guidelines; they would be helpful to prosecutors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to be able to confirm that clause 1 has the Government's full support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>CONFISCATION RELATING TO A COURSE OF CRIMINAL CONDUCT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 3, line 24, leave out "four" and insert "two".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals with the provision that four be the number of qualifying offences set out in new section 72AA(1)(c)(i). For ease, I shall refer to the helpful notes on clauses, which have been provided for us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 provides for the insertion of new section 72AA into the Criminal Justice Act 1988. The notes on clauses state that it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0350">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"provides for the confiscation of the defendant's benefit from a course of criminal conduct. It enables the court to make a rebuttable assumption that property which has been received or spent by the defendant in the six years before the institution of proceedings came from crime. The court can then order the defendant (subject to the amount of realisable property available for confiscation) to pay an amount equivalent to the total benefit from the assumed offences. The Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986, as consolidated in the Drug Trafficking Act 1994, already contains similar provisions in respect of the proceeds of drug trafficking. They are considerably more rigorous than the provisions in the Bill. Part VI of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, however, which is amended by the Bill, applies to the generality of criminal conduct and is necessarily more flexible than the drug trafficking provisions.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The main differences between the two assumptions systems are that, under the Drug Trafficking Act, the court must apply the assumptions whereas under the 1988 Act as amended by the Bill, it has a discretion as to whether it does so. Under the Drug Trafficking Act the assumptions must be made in all cases, even following a first conviction for a single drug trafficking offence. Under the provisions in the Bill they can only be applied where there is either a previous relevant conviction, or a person is convicted of four or more relevant offences in the present proceedings. Third, the assumptions may only be made under the 1988 Act, as amended by the Bill, where the prosecutor gives the court a declaration that the case is appropriate for them to be made.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>At present, under Part VI of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, the court is only able to confiscate the proceeds of the offences convicted and taken into consideration in the current proceedings. The existing provisions do not operate effectively to confiscate the proceeds of the sorts of acquisitive crimes which are committed repeatedly.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Subsection (1) sets out the circumstances where new section 72AA applies. The defendant must have been convicted of a qualifying offence which is an offence of a relevant description. There are three other preconditions. First, the prosecutor must have given written notice for the purposes of section 71(1)(a). The section cannot apply where the court is proceeding under section 71 of its own volition.) Second, the prosecutor's notice must contain a declaration that, in the prosecutor's opinion, the case is one where it is appropriate for the provisions of section 72AA to be applied. Third, the offender must have been convicted in the present proceedings of at least four qualifying offences (including the offence in question) or have been convicted of a qualifying offence on at least one previous occasion during the relevant period, that is to say in the six years prior to the institution of the present proceedings."</p></blockquote>

Why do my hon. Friend and those who drafted the Bill with him think that four is a magic number? In other legislation to which I drew attention, there is no qualifying number. I may, of course, need to be corrected if I have misread the 1986, 1988 or 1994 Acts, but, as I understand it, there is no number of qualifying offences—no hurdle—to be overcome for relevant assumptions to be made. Perhaps my hon. Friend, or anyone else who cares to advise me, can say why the figure of four was chosen. Why are not three, or two, better numbers for these purposes? I go further, as might other members of the Committee. The sound of the words "one" or "no" brings music to my constituents' ears. There is perhaps room for further deliberation and discussion of paragraph (c).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may briefly tell the Committee of some of the serious offences and confiscation orders that have been dealt with under the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986. Under that Act, and the 1984 Act, no qualifying number applies, although huge sums are confiscated from criminals who have committed thoroughly anti-social crimes. Two cases illustrate my
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
point, to persuade my hon. Friend perhaps to reconsider whether four is the right number.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first case is that of the Crown 	<i>v.</i> Simons which came before the Court of Appeal on 25 May 1993. The appellant had died before the appeal could be heard, but the case was referred to the court on the ground that the appellant's widow had a material outcome in the outcome. The appellant had been convicted of being concerned in the importation of a class B controlled substance, phenobarbitone. Between 1987 and 1988, five consignments of phenobarbitone, which had been manufactured illegally in Hong Kong, were shipped to the United Kingdom for onward transmission to Africa. The appellant had received payments from one party, out of which he made payments to another. The Crown court made a confiscation order under the 1986 Act in the amount of £199,139. Mr. Justice Henry, giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said that for the purposes of the 1986 Act the whole amount of the payments received by the appellant was from the proceeds of drug trafficking, not merely the amount that he retained after paying the third party. The fact that a series of defendants might be ordered to pay in total an amount greater than the profits from criminal activities was no objection. Parliament clearly intended the Act to be draconian. If there was a chain of contracts, each purchase price was a payment, and this consequence could not be avoided by a middle man acting as a postman handing on a payment from the consignee to the consignor and treating what would usually have been his profit as his handling fee. This is just one example of an offence that created a confiscation order for almost £200,000. It was made against the widow of the original defendant. If there is to be any cross-fertilisation from the 1988 Act—and, indeed, from the drug trafficking legislation of 1986 and 1994—to the Bill, we should reconsider whether four is the right number. Huge sums may be earned by a defendant on one offence during the relevant qualifying period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening with great care to my hon. Friend's argument, and especially to his consideration of whether four is the correct figure. Would he care to speculate on the fact that someone could have two convictions at different times—a previous offence and the current offence? Why should a person who happens to have been convicted of two offences on separate occasions be dealt with more harshly than one who is convicted of four offences, with the conviction taking place on a single occasion although the offences might have taken place over a considerable length of time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a helpful illustration of the concern that I am trying to express. My hon. Friend has considerable experience in the criminal courts and it may be that he has come across cases in which the problem to which he referred manifested itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An earlier case than Regina 	<i>v.</i> Simons, Regina 	<i>v.</i> Redbourne, was also dealt with by the Court of Appeal. The defendant had been stopped by the police while driving and 26.1 kg of cannabis had been found
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0351">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
in the boot of his car. He pleaded guilty to possessing a class B drug with intent to supply but claimed that he was merely acting as a courier who had agreed only on that single occasion to transport the cannabis on behalf of another for a payment of £2,000. He said that he was in financial difficulties because he had received some stolen goods that had in turn been stolen from him and was being pressed for payment by the supplier of those goods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Police enquiries revealed that the defendant—who had been unemployed and claiming income support for 12 years—and his wife had 11 bank or building society accounts into which £233,154 had been paid in the six years preceding the institution of the proceedings—as in the Bill, six years was the relevant period. He had other property and had made expenditures and the prosecution alleged that the total value of his proceeds of drag trafficking was £249,547. The defendant claimed that he had earned £40,000 from dealing in counterfeit clothing and perfume and from other dishonest dealing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After an inquiry that lasted eight days—a long time, as we were saying earlier—the judge made the assumptions permitted by section 2(3) of the 1986 Act, accepted that no more than £10,000 of the money paid into the accounts was the proceeds of dishonest dealing not involving drugs, and made a confiscation order in the amount of £61,886. There again is an instance of a huge sum of money identified in the inquiry into a single offence and the generation of a huge confiscation order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is not just a matter of a substantial amount of money being involved in one instance? It is not unknown for counts to be laid charging a general deficiency when the detailed circumstances of every act that may have gone into a theft are not fully known. That is acceptable to the courts. Equally, there could be a case of conspiracy involving a course of conduct that is in itself only one offence. In such circumstances, why should a distinction be made between a case in which sample counts are laid and another in which a conspiracy or general deficiency count may be put together?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely right. In some cases, clever criminals will not admit to other offences so that they cannot be taken into consideration. If they were available to be taken into consideration, they could be taken into consideration when the court decided on the confiscation amount. I and my hon. Friends were surprised that the figure four was chosen. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter will discuss the matter with the Minister to see whether the figure in new section 72AA(1)(c) should be reconsidered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman assure me that the Bill is not being frustrated deliberately? The Bill is aimed at dealing effectively with criminals, and the public want it to get on the statute book

quickly. The hon. Gentleman's speeches are very lengthy and he is frustrating the passage of the Bill. The public will not appreciate that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not comment on that rather intemperate intervention. The hon. Gentleman should not judge others by his own base standards. [Hon. Members: "Oh!"] What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to cast aspersions on my conduct, he should be prepared to take it on the chin when I get cross and answer back. It is not acceptable for the hon. Gentleman to come in and out of the Room as he has done all morning. He pops in to make a soundbite intervention then pops out to sign some more correspondence before popping back in to intervene in the debate. I am making a serious point. If the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. Is it in order for the hon. Gentleman to insult my hon. Friend the Member for Warwickshire, North? The hon. Gentleman has cast an aspersion on my hon. Friend's role as an adviser to the Police Federation. That role is a fact, not a claim. The hon.

My hon. Friend the Member for Exeter contributed an article to the 	<i>House Magazine</i> on 25 January 1995. That article can be found on page 3 of the House of Commons research paper, which also contains a reference to the parliamentary question tabled by the hon. Member for Wallsend (Mr. Byers) to my hon. Friend the Minister of State, whose reply sets out in tabular form the figures for the amounts of money realised following confiscation orders under the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986 and the Criminal Justice Act 1988. Those figures are remarkably low. Would not those figures be improved if the high hurdle of four qualifying offences were reduced to two, as in the amendment, or even fewer? My aim is to produce effective legislation. I am not filibustering, as the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A stranger in our midst—Mr. Greenway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Greenway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I apologise for my late arrival, Mr. Hill. I had arranged another meeting in the City some months ago which I had to attend, as my hon. Friend the Member for Harborough knew. Despite my late arrival and contrary to what was said a few moments ago, I resisted the temptation to make a Second Reading speech on clause one stand part. I thought that everything that needed to be said about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0352">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
the Bill had already been said. However, I believe the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend for Harborough is valid and raises an important question about the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some members of the Committee bear the scars of previous Criminal Justice Bill Standing Committees. Having heard lengthy speeches in those Committees from both Government and Opposition, I think that we ought to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Harborough for brevity rather than filibustering in his last contribution. In the light of such scars, it is easy to consider draft legislation and decide that it looks sensible. Six months or a year down the line, we find that magistrates and judges say to us, "We think you've got this wrong." Section 2 of the Criminal Justices Act 1991 is a case in point, and the arguments that we had in this room—or perhaps it was in Committee Room 12—about unit fines are another example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was Committee Room 12. We warned the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Greenway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was indeed Committee Room 12.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of unit fines is relevant. The argument then was about whether the value of the smallest unit should be £2 or £4. Incidentally, the numbers two and four have cropped up again, though in a different context. We took our eye off the main ball—the fact that whereas the experiment in unit fines had used a maximum unit of £40, in the legislation we upped it willy-nilly to £100. Any members of the Committee who have practised in court will confirm that that was the cause of difficulty. We must therefore take care. The fact that there is unanimous support for the Bill from all hon. Members in the Committee and in the House and from those in another place does not mean that we should not scrutinise carefully the implications of the law that we are passing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that clause 2, proposed new section 72AA(1)(c) appears to give the court two options. If it is the only time that the offender has been convicted of an offence, there must be four offences to establish a pattern of offending. If, on the other hand, the person has previously appeared in court, he need be convicted of only one offence. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere made that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my hon. Friend the Minister explain the thinking behind the provision that there must be four offences? He will know how difficult it can be for the police and the Crown Prosecution Service to get one offence to stick, even though the police may know that there has been a pattern of offending and that significant amounts of money and property have been acquired by criminal activity. The amendment is valid, but it may be that after further deliberation the Committee will want to postpone a final decision on it until Report. In my almost eight years in the House I have sat on many Committees, usually for
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
Government Bills. My experience is that we make legislation in haste but we repent at leisure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, if the proposed confiscation order had been available when those crooks were convicted of the great train robbery, it would have been irrelevant because there was only one robbery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have the opportunity to make two short points. First, I am worried that the number of qualifying offences in subsection (1)(c) does not necessarily reflect the seriousness of the course of conduct. I tried to outline the problem earlier in an intervention. A defendant before a court might have committed one offence but it might involve numerous acts of criminality over a long period. I am thinking of a conspiracy, for example, where the crime is technically the agreement, but which can amount to very serious criminality over many months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these circumstances, there is an opportunity for the prosecutor to say that he prefers to charge the indictment with sample counts and to set down four counts of theft. Alternatively, the prosecutor could say that the agreement was the substance of the crime so he will charge a conspiracy. A prosecutor should not be put in the invidious position of being unable to opt for conspiracy because it would mean that confiscation provisions would not be available. So the qualification in subsection (1)(c)(i) amounts to a real difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Someone may have committed two offences—the instant case and the previous conviction—which together are less serious than the conspiracy charged in the instant case. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to consider further whether the qualification should be worded as it is?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it necessary to have subsection (1)(c) at all? Section 72AA deals with the conviction for a qualifying offence of a relevant description and specifies that the prosecutor has to given written notice, which must contain a declaration that the prosecutor believes that the case was appropriate to the provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now subsection (3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When proceedings under section 71 above in pursuance of the notice … the court may, if it thinks fit, determine that … the assumptions … are to be made for the purpose—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) of determining whether the defendant has benefited from relevant criminal conduct".</p></blockquote>
So the court has discretion whether to apply those assumptions for that purpose. "Relevant criminal conduct" is defined in subsection (1D) in clause 1 as being an offence of which the criminal is convicted at the time,
	<br><blockquote><p>"together with any other offences of a relevant description which are either—
	<ol>
	<li>(a) offences of which he is convicted in the same proceedings, or</li>
	<li>(b) offences which the court will be taking into consideration in determining his sentence for the offence in question."</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
So the judge will have had notice given; a declaration will have been given by the prosecutor that the case
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0353">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
was appropriate for confiscation in that it related to a course of criminal conduct. The judge will be aware of the nature of the offence before the court and of any previous convictions. He will thus be able to decide whether there is a case for seeking to determine whether a defendant had benefited from relevant criminal conduct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these circumstances, is it necessary to have extra qualifications—the need for four qualifying offences or a previous conviction? The extra qualificaions may be necessary, but I cannot really see why.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the chance to make a brief contribution following the speeches of my hon. Friends the Members for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) and for Hertfordshire, North, with whom I strongly agree. I also agree with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Harborough that we should not be in such haste to put this important Bill on the statute book. We should not leave anomalous—perhaps difficult—situations outstanding and thus cause frustration later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Harborough raised an important point of substance. He was right to ask about the trigger mechanism. The provision in clause 2 is draconian; it allows assumptions to be made about a defendant's lifestyle, his property and expenditure. It is justifiably draconian because it is aimed at the mischief of the lifestyle offender and it is right that courts should be able to make such assumptions. Subsection (1)(c) confines that procedure to certain categories of offenders who have shown themselves to be engaged in lifestyle crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Harborough asked why the clause limits the provision to offenders with four offences or one previous conviction. It is important to give the courts the maximum amount of discretion on such matters. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North made some significant points about the situations facing courts when dealing with conspiracy charges and rolled-up offences. It would be extremely undesirable if courts identified the mischief that the clause is aimed at but were unable to deal with it because of artificial restrictions that we had placed on their discretion. I am a great believer in leaving matters to the discretion of the courts. We train judges and magistrates, we appoint experienced people to be judges and we appoint responsible people to be magistrates, so we should trust them to operate the law and should give them the flexibility that will enable them to do justice in such situations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to consider the fact of offending and not the time of conviction. I do not want to rehearse the arguments that I made in my intervention, but I should say that a similar point has been raised by other provisions that set up trigger mechanisms. In the dim and distant past, when I considered road traffic law, the same problem cropped up. Those who framed the totting-up provisions placed emphasis on the fact and the commission of offences rather than on the time
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
they came before the court and resulted in a conviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take the argument a little further by drawing the Committee's attention to an example of a case in which the courts might find their hands tied and might lack the discretion necessary to do justice to it—I hope that the Committee will forgive me for developing the point in this way. I invite the Committee to consider this scenario: two criminals, X and Y, decide to embark on a criminal enterprise. Criminal X is the more sophisticated criminal, criminal Y is less sophisticated. Between them they commit a serious offence, such as the offence dealt with by the Bill. Criminal X makes off with the property, he arranges to share it out with criminal Y but before he is able to do so both of them are arrested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When carrying out the offence criminal X has been careful to leave no forensic evidence behind nor anything to tie him in with the offence. When he is arrested by the police he does not co-operate and makes no admissions. Criminal Y leaves evidence behind by making a slip. When that is put to him in interview he makes admissions. He eventually stands trial before the Crown court and pleads guilty to carrying out the offence on his own, while criminal X goes free and has the benefit of the property that they have jointly stolen. Criminal Y serves a sentence of several years' imprisonment and on his release he joins forces again with criminal X and they decide to commit another offence. This time, both of them are caught red-handed and arrested at the scene of the crime and they are both convicted. Criminal X decides that he will get rid of the earlier offence by pleading guilty to it; he admits to the earlier offence so he is convicted of two offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A court could well find itself faced with criminals such as those and, under the provisions that we are placing on the statute book, the more sophisticated criminal—criminal X—could not have the proceedings used against him; although he has admitted to two offences, he has pleaded guilty to both on the same occasion. There is no way in which the provisions could be brought to bear against him. They could not even be brought to bear against him if he pleaded guilty to another, quite separate, offence on the same occasion. The three convictions take place as part of the same proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Criminal Y could have the provisions brought to bear against him because he committed the earlier offence, was convicted of it and has committed a further offence. Criminal Y has committed two offences and can have the proceedings brought against him, but criminal X, who might have committed three offences for all we know, cannot have the proceedings brought against him. Of course, criminal X has benefitted from the stolen property and the proceedings should really be brought against him because he is the person who made off with the property from the first offence. He escapes scot free and cannot have the provisions brought against him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will recall the remarks of Mr. Justice McCullough in the case of Bragason. He made the point that there is a difference between an offender whose part in the commission of the offence was major and an offender who played a minor role, and that it is important to recognise those differences and sentence more severely the man at the heart of the offence. Proper account should be taken of that. The court might sentence the man who was at the heart of the offence more seriously in terms of the length of sentence or the size of the fine, but the minnow would have all his assets for the past six years stripped from him. So, the court would be making a sentencing homily along the lines of "You're the man at the centre of things, you did it, you led others astray and you'll go to prison but we won't take any of your assets away." But the chap who has been led astray gets clobbered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He has made an important intervention which goes a long way to supporting my argument. His comments about major and minor criminals are absolutely right. Courts are often faced with such cases. It is often the major criminal who is the more sophisticated. He takes care and does not make admissions when he is interviewed by the police. Under the scenario that I envisaged, that criminal would get away with his crime. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North is right that, by erecting the hurdles, we could create a net—if I can adopt my hon. Friend's description—which will catch the minnows but let the big fish get away. I invite hon. Members to consider that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have not made the problem appear too far-fetched. Such cases come before the courts and I would rather that the Committee discussed the issue now and considered examples and scenarios such as that which, as Opposition Members might know, often come before the courts. Before the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North gets cross, he should draw from his long experience of appearing before the lower and the higher courts. If he casts his mind back he will realise that it is very important—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Everybody agrees that something needs to be done to prevent criminals from benefiting from persistent offending. The difficulty is in deciding the best means to achieve that agreed end.

As my hon. Friend the Member for Harborough pointed out, part VI of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 applies to crime generally. In effect, it bites on all offences, other than drug trafficking offences and offences under part III of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989. In the Bill, we are in the difficult position of wanting to create effective provisions to amend part VI of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, while ensuring that adequate safeguards exist in respect of trivial cases. It is a matter of judgment as to whether the correct balance has been struck.

Major criminals may well have become major criminals by avoiding conviction, so that when they finally appear before the courts, they do so as first-time offenders or as people without a recent criminal record. The previous offence trigger for the assumptions will not apply to such an offender. For the other trigger, which is under discussion here, to apply, it will be necessary for the defendant to have been convicted of four or more offences. Some of my hon. Friends have suggested two, one or even no triggering offences. That is a matter of judgment.

The situation is, however, not as dire as some of my hon. Friends might think. In the case of a pornographer who is brought before a court and who probably has a lifetime of offending behind him or who has, according to police evidence, sold a few hundred pornographic tapes that year, the CPS would not list every tape and the day on which it was sold. It would list a few specimen charges. It is possible, therefore, that, although that person comes to court only on that one occasion and is charged with distributing pornographic tapes, the indictment would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0355">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
contain four sample charges and state that the accused sold pornographic tapes on four separate occasions. If he is convicted, there will be four convictions. One court appearance, four offences, four convictions—the assumptions apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not my hon. Friend looking down the telescope from the wrong end? We should not grant indictments on the basis of trying to get around the difficulty I spoke of, but should create laws that are properly applied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not suggest that the CPS will have to change its practice to get around the Bill if it is enacted. It is, however, CPS practice to pick sample charges and not to put every charge on the charge sheet. Knowing that CPS practice, it was felt that the trigger mechanism would be adequate. However, I—and my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter—have heard the arguments that the level might not be right. I am sure that my hon. Friend will want to take those into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither I nor the Government have a right view of what the figure should be. We have supported my hon. Friend's proposal of four. Clearly, if there is a consensus or a different view, my hon. Friend may make changes at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the point of a conspiracy, I remember prosecuting a case involving something like 70 burglaries where the proper charge was conspiracy to burgle. Is my hon. Friend saying that for the confiscation procedure to be available, I would have had to elect to choose samples?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is interesting. If the charge were conspiracy to burgle and, say, 60, different offences were involved, I would imagine—I stand to be corrected—that to prove the case, the CPS would have said that there was a conspiracy because on three, four, five or six occasions—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Plus the evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, that would come through on the evidence or there would be no conviction, but if there were only one charge relating to one incident, that would not trigger the assumptions. It would be possible in such a case to have four sample charges. It can be done and I understand that it is done at the moment without any great difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter has listened carefully to the points that have
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
been made. I merely wish to put the Government's view on record that while we support my hon. Friend in the Bill and in the figures, they are not necessarily set in concrete if wiser counsels prevail. We wish to reflect on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Hannam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Contrary to expectations, the debate has been very valuable. As my hon. Friend the Minister said, the matter needs to be looked at further. The argument about what number of offences would trigger the assumptions is a difficult one. My hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale made a point about the great train robbery, but that would not apply here. The single large offence committed would be covered by section 71 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, as amended in clause 1, and a confiscation order could therefore be applied by the court at that stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 2, we move on to having to make assumptions in the court about a continuing process of crime and a decision therefore has to be made about what constitutes the trigger. The points that have been raised are important, particularly that made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere about someone pleading guilty to more than one offence on the same occasion. The result of that would of course be that the defendant would find that all proceeds of offences would be liable for confiscation. That suggests that the defendant would not necessarily plead guilty to those offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Enough points have been made and enough evidence has been put forward by my hon. Friends to cause me to think again about the magic number—whether it should be two, three or four. I would like to take the matter away, reflect on the points that have been raised and come back on Report with some conclusions which may—or may not—offer a change in the figure. On that basis, I ask my hon. Friend to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garnier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter for his helpful intervention. I, and am sure other hon. Members who have participated in the debate, am grateful for his assurance that he will reconsider the issue. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
