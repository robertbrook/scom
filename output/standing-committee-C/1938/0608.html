—(The Rayon Committee.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p>Amendment proposed [6th June] in page 18, line 30, to leave out from "The," to "Board" in line 42.—[<i>Mr. Levy.</i>]</p>
<p>Question again proposed, "That the words proposed to be left out stand part of the Clause."</p>
<p>11.6 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rhys Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think I shall be voicing the unanimous feelings of hon. Members of all parties when I say that we congratulate the hon. Member for South Croydon (Sir Herbert Williams) on the honour that has been bestowed upon him. We dislike his politics, but we have a sneaking regard for his personality, and I sincerely hope that the honour that has been bestowed upon him is a recognition more of his industry than of his political antics.<br><br>
I think the Committee will agree that we have now reached one of the most important stages in the consideration of this Bill. Frankly, the conflict between cotton and rayon has rather surprised some of us who are not in intimate contact with the conflicting parties, and we had hoped that the compromise which the Minister has inserted in the Clause might have got over the difficulties in this conflict, but apparently that is not so. I ask hon. Members of all parties to try to rise above the conflict and not to fan the flames that are burning. If the hon. and gallant Member for Accrington (Major Procter) had been here, I should have said to him that his speech was not helpful. I do not know sufficient about this conflict to speak with authority, but I have been in the House for many years, and I have come across conflicts of this kind before. With very
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 638</span>
great respect to the two contending parties, I would say to them that they must understand that when they fail to come to an agreement among themselves and embody it in an Act of Parliament, the House of Commons can on occasion provide a powerful instrument itself to settle the problem. I, and I think the Minister, would prefer that the two contending parties should come to an agreement between themselves, without any further intervention by the Minister or by Members of the Committee. In spite of all that has been said I am not without hope that between now and the Report Stage the two contending parties may come to some agreement, so that the Bill may have a chance of operating smoothly.<br><br>
It is pretty clear to the Committee that the Minister met the parties andlaile3 to secure agreement between them, and unless I make a mistake, the right hon. Gentleman is determined not to give way, but to stand by the Clause as it is, because he believes—and there is a great deal of force in what he says—that the provisions of the Clause already contain a compromise of a kind. I want to tell the rayon people that they are a little bit too nervous of their future when this Clause becomes the law. What does the Clause do for them? It does not establish by mandate a committee for them. What they want, of course, is to be satisfied that a committee will be set up. We want the two industries to work together, and it is pathetic, when the cotton industry is in such a terrible plight, that there should be this conflict between the two sections of the industry which ought to help us to recapture the export trade we have lost. That is the most pathetic feature of the whole business.<br><br>
I would say to the rayon people that if I put a question on the Order Paper to the right hon. Gentleman, after the Bill has become law, asking how the Act is working, he will, I suppose, be able to reply that it is an Enabling Act, and that he has nothing to do with it once it has become law; but I think I can tell the cotton and rayon people that in the annual Debate on the Board of Trade Vote, we shall be entitled to ask the Minister to give us a review of the operation of the Act in order to see how the rayon and cotton trade is going on. That will be an opportunity
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0318">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 639</span>
of seeing how the Act works. If, when the Clause is part of an Act of Parliament, the rayon people have a genuine complaint and do not think they are being properly treated, they will be perfectly entitled to come to Members of Parliament and try to get them to induce the Board of Trade to give the rayon section what may be called a fair crack of the whip.<br><br>
When we pass the Clause to-day, it is not the end of the matter. I would plead for a little more toleration for the rayon people in this Clause were it not for this fact, that I think the Committee is determined and that there is a majority who will vote for the Clause as it stands and not for the Amendment; and, of course, what happens in the Committee is likely to happen in the House of Commons. Consequently, I think the rayon people have to understand here and now that their proposal, as put forward by the hon. Member, is already lost. They have put up a very good and a very honourable fight, but we have to face that fact this morning. The rayon people charge the cotton people with being a little stubborn. I do not know sufficient about trade and commerce to believe or disbelieve that. The cotton people, on the other hand, say that they are fearful of the monopolistic power of the rayon industry.<br><br>
The trouble with which the Committee is confronted this morning is that both sides have some sort of case. We are not asked to decide between right and wrong. The trouble in politics is that we are very seldom asked to decide between right and wrong; nearly always we are asked to decide between two rights, or between better and worse. That being the case, let me say that this is the King's birthday. It has a great psychological effect upon people. I ask those who are championing the rayon side of the case, and certainly those who are standing for the cotton industry, whether it is not possible for both sides to give way a little so that we can get rid of this Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth (Mr. Tomlinson) shakes his head.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Clause as it stands is giving way.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 640</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend and I have been in industrial disputes on many occasions—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Commander Agnew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the same side?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and gallant Member must not ask awkward questions. As a trade union official, I know that when we start out on battle we think that we have right on our side every time. My hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth has found himself in that position on more than one occasion. The "bosses" also are certain that they have right on their side, but when trade—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The President of the Board of Trade (Mr. Stanley)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not give the Committee a false impression that the Clause we are now discussing is the Joint Committee's Clause, with the rayon claims turned down. The cotton and rayon sections disagreed. The cotton section wanted no possibility of a committee of this kind in any circumstances, and the rayon section wanted a mandatory one. The Clause is my compromise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought I had made that clear. Why the right hon. Gentleman should intervene when I was having a nice little quarrel with my hon. Friend I do not know.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always ready to protect the weaker side.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Cyril Entwistle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member must also remember that every possible concession has been made by the Joint Committee on other Clauses. There has been the question of the veto and all those concessions on Clause 9 with regard to prices.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Member for Bolton (Sir C. Entwistle) must not misunderstand me. I have been trying to pour oil on troubled capitalist waters—which is a strange role for a Labour Member. I represent in the House one of the most depressed areas in these islands. I have seen cotton mills disappearing there, and the situation is appalling. It makes me very sad to think that when we are trying to capture trade that we have lost, two sections of private enterprise are quarrelling among themselves. I am as certain as I stand here, without knowing as much about this business as some hon. Members, that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0319">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 641</span>
unless those two sections can come together we shall not regain any of that export trade. Whatever these contending parties may say here, whatever they may say to each other, and whatever they may not be able to say to each other, I am satisfied that when the Bill is in operation a great deal of their fears will disappear. If any appeal of mine is of any use, I would urge the hon. Members supporting these Amendments to let the Clause stand as it is; and I am not without hope that much of their fears will disappear before the Bill returns to the Floor of the House. These are two complementary sections of an industry, and I cannot see how they can proceed unless they assist each other. I would welcome some arrangement between the two parties, so that we can get on with the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Strickland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish that the possibilities of settling the unfortunate contention about this Clause were as great as has been suggested by my hon. Friend opposite, but we have wandered very far in the dispute from the question of protecting the cotton lamb from the rayon wolf. My right hon. Friend's remarks about rayon producers and this Bill, which I see were discreetly withdrawn from the OFFICIAL REPORT—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. This really is rather serious. I wish the hon. and gallant Member would explain himself on that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Strickland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be very glad if any hon. Member would show me where in the Official Report it states that in the rayon industry the producers keep one-eighth of an eye on their business and the other seven-eighths on this Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is in the OFFICIAL REPORT.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. and gallant Member accusing me of withdrawing from the Official Report what I have said? Will he tell me what passage from my speech has been removed, either discreetly or otherwise?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Strickland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I regret very much if I have overlooked it. I looked very carefully through the speech to see that particular reference to the allocation of business time. If I have overlooked it, I offer my apology. I was not suggesting that it was done by the President of the Board of Trade.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 642</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must treat this matter seriously. To say of anyone, and particularly of a Minister, that after he has made a statement—and made it with a sense of responsibility—he has had it discreetly removed from the Official Report, is an imputation of bad faith. It should never have been made without notifying the person against whom it was made. It often happens, by some slip of reporting, that something does get left out; but in this case it is indefensible. This is a matter on which I am entitled to the fullest apology and withdrawal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Strickland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I ask the President of the Board of Trade and the Committee to accept such an apology. I looked through the Report and I did not see it at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The mere fact that the hon. and gallant Member did not see the item is not enough to justify him in making such an imputation against a Minister. The least that one may expect from a Parliamentary colleague is that if he thinks somebody has removed something from the Official Report he should go to him in the usual way and speak to him about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Strickland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think I can go further than to say that I did not accuse the right hon. Gentleman of removing it. It is not the first time that Members have had to face gibes in this Committee. I did not see the statement in the Official Report, though I looked for it; and I cannot do more than utter my apologies.<br><br>
To return to Clause 15, it is unfortunate that at present it has been found impossible to combine in the rayon industry the whole of the sections. The President of the Board of Trade at our last meeting made certain remarks with which I think every Member of this Committee will most cordially agree. The first was that it was important to see that in helping cotton we did not damage rayon and other textiles. The second was that he would like to see a rayon committee set up. He explained that one reason why he could not accept these Amendments, to make this committee a compulsory one under the Act, instead of a permissive one, was that certain sections of the industry had a great fear of the producers. We have frequently heard the case argued here of the rayon weavers' minority, and that,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0320">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 643</span>
because this minority fear what would happen if the committee were set up, we should be ill advised to set up a committee. I shall try to prove that these fears are entirely groundless. We recognise the enormous difficulty that the President of the Board of Trade has had in framing this Bill and steering clear of both Scylla and Charybdis. He has had to exercise the utmost of his known ingenuity in framing this Bill.<br><br>
We have no desire whatever, on the rayon side, to force everybody to come into this committee. If the committee is set up, not as a permissive committee but as a compulsory committee, there is no reason why any section should be compelled to join. It may be said, if you do that, would not the weavers, who are dissident, have no power of voice? But they have. They have very great power of expression in their own particular committee; but that does not alter the principle of the thing. Clause 15, as it stands, is most unsatisfactory to the rayon side. It is so unsatisfactory that the rayon people feel that they cannot, on any account, accept this Clause except under the direst compulsion. They cannot, as the position stands, accept any compromise under Clause 15, unless it is such a compromise as was so ably suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for South Croydon (Sir H. Williams). We feel that arrangements ought to be made under the Bill to set up a central committee for the rayon industry as an integral part of this Bill. The whole question seems to turn on the use of that permissive "if" in the second line of the Clause. The point remains that this committee may never be set up throughout the existence of this scheme, and may be kept from being set up by a very small section.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Commander Agnew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand the effect of the Amendment, even if it were carried it would be permissive, and not mandatory, on the Board of Trade to set up the committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Strickland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, we want this committee compulsorily set up under the Act. All this dependence on being able to get a completely united voice throughout all the sections of the industry is a new thing. The President of the Board of Trade, I think, will agree with me that in the original Blue Book issued to the trade the suggestion was that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 644</span>
majority of the rayon industry, if they voted in favour of it, would be able to have this committee set up—I speak subject to correction. In the Bill itself there is a complete change. One section—or, in the case of the weavers, a minority of a section—can, by holding a pistol to the head of the industry, endeavour to obtain any terms whatever as their price for coming in. It cannot be regarded as a square deal for the whole of the industry. Rayon is a separate industry. It is brought into the cotton industry in so far as you get mixtures of cotton and rayon, but if cotton were to disappear rayon would go on. It is no more a component part of cotton than coal, in the production of iron, is a component part of the iron and steel industry. We know that coal has its bearing on the iron and steel industry, but coal has other purposes as well—and so has rayon.<br><br>
I referred the other day to a case of what I consider utter injustice. Machines which are taken out of the cotton trade, thus removing a burden from the cotton trade, are to be levied upon. To put it into bold figures, if 75 per cent. of the rayon industry is in favour of setting up this committee, 25 per cent. can prevent it for all time from coming into existence under this particular Clause. The Committee will notice that the Clause does not lay down even that any section expressing an opinion must be composed of those wholly engaged in the rayon industry. You can have people whose main interest is cotton, but who happen to be in the weaving association and they can use their natural cotton bias against the rayon industry. We will suppose, to take a case in point, that we are dealing with the contents of a material under the price scheme. Say it is a material that has 50 per cent. rayon and 50 per cent. cotton in its production. Suppose that from the cotton industry point of view it was decided to reduce the rayon content to 30 per cent. and increase the cotton content to 70 per cent. That would be a distinct blow at the rayon production of this country. It would do what this Bill seeks to do. It would help cotton. It would help to increase the production of cotton but it would damage the rayon industry by reducing its output.<br><br>
We do feel very strongly indeed that some committee should be set up under this Bill which might view this thing from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0321">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 645</span>
the rayon point of view and, be it noted, without any executive power whatever. There is nothing in the acceptance of these Amendments that interferes in the very slightest with any part of the purpose of this Bill. It cannot damage cotton. It cannot have any effects on the levies or the price schemes. It is merely consideration of the rayon point of view as the recognised authority of the rayon industry. It can make its recommendations as a recognised body. But under this Bill rayon could have no voice except through the mixed committees and boards on which cotton predominates in every single instance. The committee of the Cotton Trade Organisation are frankly opposed to the setting up of this rayon committee from the very start. When my hon. Friend spoke just now with regard to perpetual concessions, what else could happen? This is a cotton Bill and any change must be in the nature of a concession to meet the rayon point of view. There is nothing very magnanimous about that. If you have an injustice being created under the Bill, as we believe it is, surely you do not call removing the injustice a concession. This I think is a proved injustice. Without such a committee the cotton side must always have the preponderating influence on any decisions arrived at. Why does cotton oppose the setting up of this committee?<br><br>
Let any cotton representative here this morning get up and tell this Committee why he opposes the setting up of a committee which will interfere with no cotton scheme, prices or redundancy and which is merely a consultative body. Why should not rayon itself be permitted to express its views as cotton is? The Cotton Industry Board would be left as the principal body under the Bill, and its recommendations must carry tremendous weight as the schemes go forward to the Advisory Council and then to the Board of Trade. The Cotton Industry Board has powers far in excess of the actual schemes of price and redundancy. Clause 18, Subsection (<i>c</i>) says that one of the duties of the Board is to promote increased consumption of products of the industry. What industry? The cotton industry. This Board is to have power to promote increased consumption of cotton in the trade. That does not mean necessarily cotton and rayon or though it must mean that in cases of manufactures made from
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 646</span>
cotton and rayon. When you go to the purely rayon side an entirely fresh aspect seems to open up. If it means that the Cotton Board is to consider equally the encouragement and the production of rayon in this country surely the existence of this committee, set up right from the start, must be of the greatest advantage to the Cotton Industry Board itself as a body to which they can refer.<br><br>
Clause 18, Sub-section (<i>c</i>) mentions negotiations in respect of matters likely to affect both industries. You are going to have a Cotton Industry Board predominately cotton in its interest to negotiate in respect of matters likely to affect both industries. It can be fairly anticipated that the whole influence of the Board must be predominantly cotton. Rayon has been and will be increasingly competitive with cotton. It is very likely to replace cotton altogether, possibly with great advantage to Lancashire. Do not let us stop the wheels of progress. If rayon is making the progress which it is, and which we have seen it making for example in Japan, why try to stop the legitimate growth and encouragement of this industry? So far as rayon is concerned its voice is dispersed in all these bodes. There is no means of getting the rayon view put forward as a rayon view. There are certain representatives on the Cotton Board but there is nothing in the Bill that recognises rayon as the separate industry which it is. As the hon. Member for Croydon South (Sir H. Williams) said, if you do not have these amendments the rayon interests will never have an opportunity of representing officially their views to the Board of Trade.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir C. Entwistle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the Amendment passed at the last meeting of the Committee it was provided that a report on the scheme containing any modifications therein which the Cotton Industry Board think it desirable to make has to be sent to the Board of Trade. The particular objections or representations are by a body represented in the manufacturers of rayon so that they have official recognition in that Amendment to give particulars of their representations and objections, which have to go both to the Cotton Industry Committee and the Board of Trade.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Strickland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It only shows the confusion there is in the mind of the hon. and learned Member with regard to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0322">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 647</span>
this matter. The hon. and learned Member says the producers can go to the Board of Trade. I am not speaking for producers. I am speaking for an industry which is vital to my constituency and which has as many sections as cotton and is going to be as important to the country as cotton itself. I want to see those recommendations made on the rayon side.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major Procter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and gallant Member says he is not speaking for the producers. Let that be granted. He says he is speaking for the industry. There are only three other sections of industry, and the weavers and finishers are not with the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Strickland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I gave way because I thought the hon. and gallant Member wished to ask a question. I propose to deal with the matter of the Rayon Weavers' Association a little later. The Bill as it stands must leave rayon subservient to cotton all the time. The hon. and gallant Member for Accrington (Major Procter), who tried to save me last week from disaster, has asked a question about the Rayon Weavers' Association. We want to be quite clear what this Rayon Weavers' Association really means in the trade. Emphasis must be given to the fact that this association represents a minority of 65 out of 429 firms in the rayon weaving industry. That is the body which is opposing, for reasons that may be quite wise in its own judgment, this Clause, but it is a minority. It has the power of preventing this committee from coming into existence. The negotiations which were opened with the hopeful idea of coming to agreement between the producers and the weavers were broken by the Weavers' Association and not by the producers. The producers desire to carry on the negotiations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major Procter</span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Strickland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to argue a case which must be recognised as difficult for one not engaged in the trade itself. There were some points of difference between the producers and the weavers. One was the basis of the efficient cost of production and another was re-sale conditions. It might be believed that the rayon weavers were very badly handled, and this weaving associa-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 648</span>
tion has its view of its importance to the trade itself. There is a case within the knowledge of the Board of Trade, I believe. It is a case where a weaver, who was a member of their own executive had put into his works most up-to-date rayon machinery. He was asked to agree to raise his prices of sale, and because he refused to do that he was asked by the Rayon Weavers' Association to resign his position on the executive. It meant materially increasing his selling price and he was not willing to do it.<br><br>
The President of the Board of Trade stated at the last session that it was possible for rayon producers to put a weaver out of business by refusing supplies. The hon. and gallant Member for Accrington said the rayon producers are not above stopping the whole supplies of the weavers and putting hundreds of people out of work, and those were the people to be brought into the committee under the guise of consultation. I do suggest to the Committee that that is a gross travesty of the true facts. I challenged the hon. and gallant Member at the time to produce any case where any weaver has refused supplies on any other ground than that of credit, and that challenge still stands. I have since then investigated this matter very closely, and there is not a single case where such an action can be produced except on those grounds. Let me quote from the suggestions made by this Rayon Weavers' Association:
<br><blockquote><p>"It would greatly strengthen a price-fixing scheme if the committee could arrange with the artificial silk producers that the latter should not supply any yarn to non-members of the association."</p></blockquote>
This is the body which is afraid that the producers are going to cut off their supplies, and in their suggestions made to their own association they propose to go to the producers and ask them to cut off all supplies to other rayon users who are not in their particular association. That is the body which, according to the hon. and gallant Member for Accrington (Major Procter), is going to be victimised by these producers. Let us remember that 90 per cent. of the total yarn production by the rayon users goes to their own customers, the weavers, and only 10 per cent. to others. When we hear of price-cutting schemes that will under-cut the weavers because these wicked producers are making their own stuff let us get down to the rock-bottom facts. Is it

probable that a weaving firm will endanger 90 per cent. of its trade for the sake of 10 per cent.? That puts the matter in the right proportion, and it opens our eyes to the type of opposition which the rayon industry are meeting in this committee, supported by their outside organisations. It gives an indication of the justifiable fear that the rayon people have unless this committee is a compulsory committee. I am not tied down to the actual words of the Amendment—as to whether, for example, the whole of the section shall or shall not be included—but let us have in this Bill the form in which the committee will be set up, subject, if you like, to a majority of the whole of the industry, as a whole, but do not let it be held up to ransom by this particular small section which does not even represent the weavers themselves.<br><br>
Since this Bill was introduced attempts have been made to canvass those weavers who are, or appear to have been, indifferent to the Bill—and it is very doubtful whether many of them understand exactly what the contents of the Bill are. But at any rate 63 weaving firms have indicated their desire that this compulsory committee should be permitted under the Bill. There are only 65 firms in the disdained association, which is composed not only of rayon people, but of cotton weavers themselves; and the fact that there is such a narrow margin—and mind, that is only just the people who have replied to this particular canvass—indicates that there is a great possibility of coming to an understanding. But so long as one section of the rayon industry stands out you cannot have this committee set up. That is the point of view of the rayon industry. They want this committee to be able to speak with a united voice as representing the whole of the interests of rayon, from the producers to the merchants. They claim no executive power, they do not want to take anything away from cotton, they do not want to oppose anything that would benefit or help cotton, but they do want to have that committee set up in order to be able to meet together. I should greatly wish that the President of the Board of Trade would even now consent to consider the matter between now and the Report stage with a sympathetic view of the facts which I have tried to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 650</span>
present to the Committee, because this is the central point on which rayon is going to take a stand. In conclusion, I should like to say how greatly I regret having introduced the matter that I did at the start. I was entirely under a misapprehension, and I apologise again to the right hon. Gentleman and the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether I might appeal to the Committee to come to a decision? We have discussed this matter for a very long time, and I think the issues are plain to everyone, and it must be clear that the continuance of this Debate will not help what we would all like to see, and that is some relaxation of the feeling that is shown to exist between the cotton and the rayon industries. I have no doubt that the challenging speech of the hon. Gentleman on behalf of rayon could be met by a challenging speech by somebody on behalf of cotton, but the only effect of that would be to accentuate the feeling which all of us now deplore.<br><br>
Any Member of this Committee who has not been engaged in these negotiations beforehand, or who is not in close touch with one section or the other, must have felt during this Debate like Alice in Wonderland. They must have wondered what it was all about, because when you look at the Clause and see that its purpose is to set up, not a committee with any executive powers, but merely a consultative committee to which schemes have to be referred; when you realise that already under the Bill each separate section which might come under this committee will have to be taken into consultation, and their views will have to be made known to the advisory committee, to the Board of Trade and to Parliament, and that the Clause makes provision for setting up this committee provided all the sections want it to be set up; and then they hear it said that this Clause and this Amendment are the test case as to whether rayon is to be properly treated or not, and that the crack of the whip which the hon. Gentleman always wants to give to his <i>protégé</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Strickland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So do you.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Personally I do not like cracking whips to my friends—I would rather call it a square deal. To me it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0324">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 651</span>
astounding, and I think it must be to anybody who looks at it impartially. This dispute has now kept the Committee for three hours discussing the question whether you are going to set up a committee, which admittedly at the moment certain people do not want to join, or whether you are going to provide machinery so that that consultative committee can be set up when it is clear that everybody does want to join. How that can be represented as the great turning point whether the great and growing industry of rayon is going to be strangled by its competitor cotton or not I am absolutely unable to see. It is an important point. I do not want to minimise it, but let us keep to the point of this Clause. Every scheme which comes up has got to be submitted to the rayon producers for their opinion. On every scheme as it comes up those who are interested in weaving or in finishing rayon will have an opportunity of saying something about it. On every scheme that comes up the merchants, including those who are merchants of rayon, will have an opportunity of saying something about it. Therefore as the Bill stands if this committee is never set up there is no question of any of these sections being deprived of the opportunity of giving their opinion on any particular scheme.<br><br>
I see the advantage of a body on which all these sections, sitting together, can discuss things between themselves from a broad point of view, and on which they can give a united opinion. If it can be done it seems to me a more expeditious and more advantageous method, and it is because of that that I have inserted this Clause in the Bill. It is all very well to give the impression that rayon never has its case heard or met, that it is bullied and trampled on by cotton, ignored always by me who am so cotton-minded that I am unable to listen to any argument. This Clause was a genuine attempt—for which, needless to say, I never received any gratitude—to try to meet the case put up by the rayon producers, because, of course, the only people who came and asked for this committee were not these four sections, they were the rayon producers. The hon. and gallant Member said that everything is to be held up by the Rayon Weavers' Association, and that that is a minority—only 60 out of 425. Of course he is giving quite a false
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 652</span>
impression. The Rayon Weavers' Association cannot hold the thing up. The setting up of the committee does not depend upon whether a body agrees or not, it depends on whether a majority of weavers and a majority of finishers want the committee to be set up. If the hon. and gallant Gentleman is right and if the Rayon Weavers' Association is a small minority, what on earth is all the fuss about? As soon as this machinery is set up they will be able to go to this committee and convince them that they have got a majority in every section, and the committee will start functioning at once. Really the only thing that the people have got to decide to do is this. All of us, I think, would like to see a committee of this kind functioning, if it was functioning with good will among all the sections. Every provision is made for a committee so constituted to function. All we have to decide to-day is whether we are going to force into that committee various sections dealing with rayon if they do not want to go in.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Strickland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and gallant Gentleman says "No," but let him read his own Amendment. Under that, this committee has to be set up at once.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Strickland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the right hon. Gentleman will remember that I said we were not tied to this, if it were found impossible. We do not want to force anybody into this committee. When he speaks of the rayon weavers who might not want to go into the scheme, they have their power of representation through their section on the Cotton Industry Board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman explain what objection there can be to the compromise suggested?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment involves the setting up of this committee, including the representatives of weavers and finishers, whether they wish to be in it or not. Do I understand from the hon. and gallant Member's remark that he wishes to depart from that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Strickland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. That is the Amendment we are moving, but if the hon. Gentleman would promise that he would consider the matter from the point of view I have indicated this morning, then we would be willing to forgo this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0325">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 653</span>
Amendment in order to meet him. But otherwise we want the committee set up as outlined in the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members must be thinking it is more and more a question of "Alice in Wonderland." The hon. and gallant Member says that he does not want to force into a committee anybody who does not want to come into it, but this Amendment does that. Therefore, does the hon. Member withdraw the Amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Herbert Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the position as stated by the hon. Member for Westhoughton (Mr. Rhys Davies). Obviously, the Committee will reject the Amendment, and therefore, I suggested an alternative which might ultimately solve the problem and be a fair one. I should like to know whether, if the Amendment were withdrawn, my right hon. Friend would be willing to consider that alternative.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not going to bargain for the withdrawal of the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not seeking to bargain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wanted to know whether it is intended to withdraw the Amendment or to press it, seeing that the hon. Member said that it represents a principle with which he does not agree. The hon. Member, who on this matter has dealt with the subject in a much more moderate way than has been done in some other quarters, made a suggestion. He said that in order to provide machinery to set up a committee when everybody agrees, let a committee be set up now and let the people who do not agree stand out. Frankly, that seems to be rather a farce. The only point of having a new committee of this kind, when people already have power to make representations, is that it should be representative, and to set up a committee, knowing that it would not be representative, that it would only be the rayon producers under another name, would seem to me to be a farce; it would seem to serve no useful purpose at the beginning, and probably it would make it more difficult in the end ever to get the representative committee which many of us who are independent of rayon and cotton would like to see. I do not think that is a compromise I could propose to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 654</span>
Committee. The issue before the Committee is plain, and I hope that, after the long discussion we have had, it will now be possible to come to a decision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Henry Fildes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to bring the discussion back to the cotton point of view. At the meeting on Tuesday, 6th June, my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I am, in this Clause, providing, on one condition, everything the hon. Gentleman wants. That condition is that all the people concerned shall want it. That does not seem to me to be a very extraordinary or a very unreasonable condition."</p></blockquote>
I ask my right hon. Friend to apply the same condition to these proposals from the cotton trade organisation. Will he insist that before these things are carried out, everybody in the industry shall want them? Again, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I have no objections to this Committee; I should rather like to see a Committee of this kind; it would be evidence of an easing of suspicion, a relaxing of tension and a growth of good will which would be a benefit to rayon and cotton; but I am not prepared to force unwilling people to come into it."</p></blockquote>
Let us have a measure of consistency. That is a definite declaration with regard to the rayon people. My right hon. Friend went on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"I think it is unfair to them and of no good to the Committee if you know that the representatives of an important section are there against their will, are frightened to express their opinions, and are not prepared to co-operate."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, Standing Committee "C," 6th June, 1939; columns 454–6.]</p></blockquote>
My right hon. Friend indicated that there was a deadly fear in the minds of certain manufacturers that the producers of rayon would be in a position of having monopolistic control with regard to the supply of rayon to the industry. Under this Bill, the spinning industry will have the equally monopolistic powers with which Courtaulds and other people are alleged already to threaten the industry. In view of that emphatic declaration that he would be no party to forcing people unwillingly into the Committee, I ask him to bear in mind that at least one-third of the industry is prosperous and does not want to come into this Bill. Why should they be forced in?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask you, Sir Hugh, whether it is in order for the hon. Member on this Clause to speak about the Bill as a whole?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. Certainly it is not.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0326">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 655</span>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Fildes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was quoting from the speech of the President of the Board of Trade at the last meeting of the Committee. I think I am in order in drawing attention to the fact that the right hon. Gentleman has made an emphatic declaration that he will not be a party to forcing unwilling people into this Bill. I ask him to make good that declaration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to make one observation in order that the Committee's time may not be wasted any longer. Of course, every hon. Member knows that, when discussing this Amendment, we are discussing questions of a majority and a minority. I have never said that the committee cannot be set up unless every person in every section wants to come into it. All that has to be done is to convince people that a majority does. Exactly the same principle runs through the Bill as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tomiinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are several things that were said by the hon. and gallant Member for Coventry (Captain Strickland) that ought to be answered. The hon. and gallant Member's attempt to make an argument to separate the cotton industry and the rayon industry into two distinct industries, cannot be done. The hon. and gallant Member may have spoken with some knowledge of rayon in his own district, but he did not speak of rayon and its uses in the bigger sense. The two industries cannot be separated. When he spoke about the weavers and about 63 being in one category and 65 in another, the figures may have seemed convincing to individuals not familiar with the firms about which he was speaking, but those who know something about not only the Rayon Weavers' Association, but the Manufacturers' Association in the cotton industry, which also deal with rayon, and how many of them are opposed to the principle of separate industries and the giving of this power, know that the point which the hon. and gallant Member made was altogether misleading.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Strickland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To what power is the hon. Member referring?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not to the executive power, but to the power that is agitating the minds of the rayon people in seeking to set up the committee; that is, the influence which a committee of this kind must have upon the Board of Trade in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 656</span>
regard to any schemes that are put forward. I contend that the rayon producers are no more entitled to that official power than are the producers of cotton in India. Therein lies our opposition to this Amendment. Indeed, I am opposed to the Clause. I think the right hon. Gentleman has gone too far in granting this Clause to the rayon interests when the Cotton Industry (Reorganisation) Bill is coming into being. If the powers in Clause 9 had been applicable to rayon producers, there might have been some case for this Clause and this Amendment. I ask the hon. and gallant Member whether he would agree to allow the prices for spun artificial silk to come under Clause 9, and I ask those who are interested in rayon, as they claim to be interested in cotton through cotton manufacture, whether they would give them the opportunity of having some determination of the prices at which the raw material of the manufacturer has to be used. The rayon producer is outside the Bill until it gets to the stage at which we are speaking about the fixing of the prices for the manufactured article.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Fildes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is that not equally true with regard to cotton yarn?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Member knows sufficient about the Bill to know that the position is entirely different. He might suggest that the cotton trade people in Scotland are outside the Bill. I would point out to the hon. Member who spoke about 10 per cent. of the rayon industry being on machines other than those that could be used for cotton, that they are also outside the scope of the Bill. It does not affect those industries outside the manufacturing industry. The hosiery trade in Nottingham, which is now using rayon, does not come within the scope of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Strickland</span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and gallant Member sought to mislead the Committee, or at least to instruct the Committee by comparing rayon—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Strickland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order, I understood the hon. Member to say that I sought to mislead the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was a slip of the tongue, and I apologise to the hon. and gallant Member. He did not mislead the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0327">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 657</span>
Committee, but wrongly instructed it. He used the analogy of iron and coal, and suggested that just as coal is used in a variety of ways other than in connection with iron, so rayon and artificial silk are used in a variety of ways other than manufacture. Where rayon is used other than in manufacture, it does not come within the scope of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Strickland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the article is produced purely of rayon, without there being any cotton in it, is it brought under the Bill for a price-fixing scheme?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It can be, but only if it is a manufactured article which comes within the range. Silk stockings, for instance, which are manufactured articles, will not come within the range of a price-fixing scheme. If there is any objection to the price-fixing scheme, I would point out that the people for whom the hon. and gallant Gentleman is speaking are the very people who have been able to have the power to see that prices were to some extent fixed. The people who are most vitally concerned in these redundancy and price-fixing schemes are not the rayon producers, but the people who are manufacturing rayon and cloth after it has been produced. Why the people who fix the price at which the raw material shall be supplied to the manufacturer should come in afterwards and determine the price at which the manufacturers shall</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammersley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 18, line 44, to leave out "eight" and insert "ten."<br><br>
This Amendment, in conjunction with the next, would have the effect of making the rayon committee consist of ten members instead of eight, and two members would be
<br><blockquote><p>"such persons as appear to the Board of Trade to be representative of the interests of persons carrying on in the United King-</p></blockquote></span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 658</span>
<p>sell their products, beats me. These people already have a great power because of the monopoly they have developed and used. I do not complain about that; it happens in business generally. What I complain about it is that the hon. and gallant Member wants Parliament to give them another power in addition to that power.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Strickland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What power?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The power to influence the Board of Trade by giving them official recognition in the framework of this Bill. I hope not only that this Amendment will be turned down, but that, if continued suggestions are made that we should continue to compromise on what I consider to be a compromise already, the President of the Board of Trade will consider withdrawing Clause 15 altogether, and leaving the Bill, as I think, a stronger and better measure without it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose in his place, and claimed to move,</i> "That the Question be now put."</span></p>
<p>Question, "That the Question be now put," put, and agreed to.</p>
<p>Question put accordingly, "That the words proposed to be left out stand part of the Clause."</p>
<p>The Committee divided: Ayes, 24; Noes, 7.</p>
<p><br><blockquote><p>dom the business of spinning yarn from staple rayon fibre."</p></blockquote>
We have, in the course of a rather long discussion, had several references to the fact that in the rayon industry there are four sections: the producers, the manufacturers, the finishers and the merchants; but that statement is true only in respect of the rayon goods produced from continuous rayon filament yarn. If, in fact, the rayon goods are produced from rayon staple fibre, in addition to the producers
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0328">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 659</span>
of the raw material there are the spinners, as well as the manufacturers, finishers and merchants. It is really interesting to see the complete change which will now come over the picture, as compared with that on the last Amendment. Then, the producers were endeavouring to show that the manufacturers of their materials were rather inclined to old-fashioned and archaic methods, and that they were anxious to see the material sold in the markets of the world at a lower price. That was the real gravamen of the case. Now, these producers of raw material have to sell to spinners and the spinners have to convert the raw material into yarn. The producers fix the price at which they sell to the spinners and the price at which the spun staple fibre should be sold.</p>
<p>If it is true that the rayon industry wants to see the maximum development and the maximum efficiency in the rayon industry as a whole surely it should be willing to see that the spinner of staple fibre who can produce the most efficiently and is selling at the lowest price should be allowed to sell at whatever price he considers fit, or certainly that he should have some say in the matter. In point of fact, the producers of rayon, in their efforts to promote the production and sale of staple fibre, have purchased a cotton spinning factory as a model. That factory, although many people in the trade would not like to say so, is not the most efficient spinner of staple fibre; at all events, there are spinners of staple fibre who have a better name and who, in a restricted market, would find that their products were taken in advance of fibre spun by the producers. Therefore, we have the extraordinary position that in the previous discussion the producers of yarn were anxious to see a reduction of the price of the finished product, in the shape of cloth, but they prevent the manufacturers of the staple yarn from selling their yarn at the lowest possible price in the market.</p>
<p>It may be desirable to fix prices, but I think that the Committee will agree that if we are to have this committee set up, certainly the voice of those who spin staple fibre should be heard. I speak as one anxious to do nothing to exacerbate any feelings of suspicion between the two sections, I appreciate that the producers
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 660</span>
of raw material are inclined to think the manufacturers old-fashioned, but they cannot say that of the spinners of staple fibre. I represent one who is anxious to sell staple fibre at a lower price than he is allowed to do it. It is a strange commentary that in this small and not so very important section of the industry the producers should impose this rigidity, whereas in the manufacturing section they are all for securing a reduction of price.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Levy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think there is any objection to this Amendment so far as we are concerned; but, as I am informed, the prices were arranged with the spinners themselves. That is all I want to say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think we can leave out all questions of prices, which have nothing to do with the Amendment. I can see no objection to the inclusion of these people, the rayon interests see no objection, the interest concerned wants to be included, and I think the Committee can congratulate itself on a quite unusual degree of unanimity.</span></p>
<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p>Further Amendment made: In page 19, line 7, at the end, insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"(<i>b</i>) in respect of two members, with such bodies, if any, as appear to the Board of Trade to be representative of the interest of persons carrying on in the United Kingdom the business of spinning yarn from staple rayon fibre."—[<i>Mr. Hammersley.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>12.28 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 19, line 23, to leave out "rayon yarn or."<br><br>
I am not clear whether it is intended that these merchants referred to in this part of the Clause are the merchants who sell yarn or the merchants who are sellers of fabrics.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Both.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that the only class of merchant you are concerned with at this stage is the merchant handling the sale of fabrics. It does not seem to me that you want to bring in those dealing with the sale of yarn. Whether they exist to any large extent I do not know, but they may be quite different bodies of people. It seems rather strange to associate the merchant who handles yarn with the merchant who handles fabrics, because I imagine that they are not the same group. The Clause,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0329">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 661</span>
as drafted, seems unsatisfactory, but perhaps the President of the Board of Trade may give some other interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These words have been put in because we understood that the rayon people, if they had a committee at all, wanted it to cover all phases of activity dealing with rayon. I understand that there are merchants who deal in rayon yarns and it seems to me therefore that if there are such merchants surely they form part of this great industry and it would be very wrong to exclude them, or anybody that represents them from consultation as to the formation of this committee. If I am wrong, and there are no merchants who deal with yarns of this kind, and if it is entirely done either by the rayon producers or people who spin the fibre, then there would be no point in leaving the words in.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will ask leave to withdraw the Amendment, in order that the President of the Board of Trade may look into the point.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Levy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The only point was that this Amendment was put down on the instructions of the Silk Association.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not talk about Amendments being put down on the instructions of anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Levy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not quite mean that. We, of course, put this Amendment down. I am not posing as an expert at this business, and the Silk Association, who speak with one voice for all these people, are dealing with these matters in the interests of the association which controls this industry. They were of opinion, rightly or wrongly, that these words rayon yarn were redundant in this particular Clause. I am giving them credit for knowing more about the Association's business than I can ever hope to know, and it occurs to me that if my right hon. Friend would be good enough, through his permanent officials, to see whether there is any substance in this, we could withdraw the Amendment and then it could be inserted, if necessary, on the Report stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Might I ask that this Amendment should be withdrawn? In
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 662</span>
spite of the fact that the hon. Member for Elland (Mr. Levy) pleaded very little knowledge of it, I think that anyone with any knowledge of the industry knows, as is fairly obvious, that all the yarn available to the manufacturer at the present time is sold direct. There are no yarn merchants for the simple reason that there are no firms outside the control.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Fildes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are large quantities of rayon yarn imported into this country every year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If there are large quantities, then there is reason and need for this to be in; but behind the minds of the people responsible for suggesting the Amendments is the idea that it should be monopolistically controlled. I was pointing out that, apart from that which is imported into this country, there may be somebody some day with sufficient enterprise to start a business for the manufacture of rayon, and be able to manufacture a yarn that can be used. In such a case that would require merchants to merchant it. They would be entitled to be members of an association, and surely they would be entitled to be consulted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dodd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think there is a flaw in this matter. Sub-paragraphs (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) refer in each case to spinners and manufacturers of staple fibre as well as rayon yarn, whereas in (d) mention is made only of rayon yarn or persons finishing fabrics woven from rayon. I think that (2) throughout should include those interested in finishing or merchanting fibre yarn as well as the continuous filliment yarn.</span></p>

This is linked with the next Amendment to the same line. I am advised that the interpretation of this Clause as it stands would mean that the only price schemes the Committee will be permitted to consider will be those involving rayon yarn unmixed, or rayon fabrics unmixed. I should think the intention must be to take into account all yarns or fabrics which involve rayon, otherwise the main purpose of the Committee will be defeated. I think the case for the Amendment is obvious, provided I am right in my interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade (Mr. Cross)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that it was the intention that mixtures should be covered and the hon.

This is in a sense consequential on the Amendment which I moved to carry out the pledge I have given that the Cotton Industry Board should not have a veto on a scheme going up to the Advisory Committee and from them to the Board of Trade. We have removed that veto on the scheme as it goes up, but in this Clause there is power to veto a scheme which has been amended by the Board of Trade and which has returned to the Cotton Industry Board. Under the Clause as it now stands the Cotton Industry Board can prevent any further action being taken upon that scheme. If my Amendments are accepted the Cotton Industry Board will not have that power of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 664</span>
veto and any scheme which is modified by the Board of Trade will have to be submitted as is set out in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) to the Section concerned, and if the section concerned approves of a modified scheme it will come back to the Board of Trade and so to Parliament. Having removed the one part of the veto of the Cotton Industry Board it is more or less consequential that we should remove this other part.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the same point in principle that we had when dealing with the question of the majorities necessary for passing a particular price scheme. We then discussed two-thirds or three-quarters as being the proportion necessary to pass it, and here we have the reverse of the same picture. The arguments are the same, that if we had a lesser proportion it might rest in the hands of a single amalgamation to veto a particular scheme approved by the rest of the section. In those circumstances we thought it best to leave it to the discretion of the Board of Trade to be able to reduce from one-third to a lesser proportion if they thought fit.</span></p>

"may," to the end of the Sub-section, and to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"(<i>a</i>) in the case of a price scheme make an order confirming the scheme in the terms in which it has been approved by the board;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(<i>b</i>) in the case of a redundancy scheme lay before Parliament a draft of a sectional scheme in the terms in which it has been approved by the Board of Trade, together with a copy of the report made in relation to the scheme by the Cotton Industry Advisory Committee, a copy of the report of the Cotton Industry Board on the pool taken in relation to the scheme before the transmission thereof to the Board of Trade and, if a poll has been taken under this section in relation to that scheme, a copy of the report of the Cotton Industry Board on that poll."</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the Amendment is clear. A price-fixing scheme naturally would not come into operation until after all the procedure laid down in the Bill has been complied with by an Order of the Board of Trade without such order having to be laid on the Table of the House. With regard to a redundancy scheme not only should it be laid on the Table of the House but it should have an Affirmative Resolution of the House before it can come into operation, rather than a negative resolution, as is provided in the Bill. The important part of my Amendment is to treat the two types of sectional schemes for which the Bill provides—price-fixing schemes and redundancy schemes—on a different footing with regard to Parliamentary sanction provided in Sub-section (6) of this scheme, which says that either scheme, as the Bill now stands, must be laid on the Table of the House for 28 days, and unless during those 28 days a Negative Resolution is passed by either House, the scheme shall come into operation. By my Amendment that procedure will not be necessary with regard to a price-fixing scheme, but it will be necessary with regard to a redundancy scheme. Indeed a redundancy scheme would have an Affirmative Resolution and would not come into operation unless that were passed.<br><br>
May I indicate the reasons for the different procedure suggested for dealing with redundancy schemes and price-fixing schemes? A redundancy scheme involves a levy on all the owners of mills affected by it. Furthermore, money has to be borrowed, and that money has a Treasury guarantee, so that there are obvious reasons why Parliamentary sanction should be required in the case of a redundancy scheme; and I suggest that we
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 666</span>
might have that Parliamentary sanction strengthened by having an Affirmative Resolution rather than a mere negative resolution. A redundancy scheme is not so urgent a matter as a price-fixing scheme. The mere fact that you have the power to have a redundancy scheme is in itself useful to the trade. And, in any event, considerable time is required in the borrowing of the money, and so on, so that the mere question of time is not so urgent in a redundancy scheme.<br><br>
I think the Committee will agree that a price-fixing scheme might be a matter of urgency. The two main provisions of this Bill are price-fixing and redundancy, but the price-fixing provision is what is most urgently required, and everybody admits that the necessity for this Bill, if it is going to do good, is an urgent necessity. We know how long the preparation of this Bill has taken, and how long it is taking to go through the House. Then we know all the various safeguards before a price-fixing scheme comes into operation. The scheme has to be prepared. Before it is voted on, the Cotton Industry Board have to investigate and report on it. Then the scheme has to be sent to the people affected by it and to all other sections of the industry, and of the rayon industry. All have power to make objections and representations. Then the poll has to be taken. When you have gone through all this procedure the scheme has to go to the Advisory Committee, with its three independent members, and they also have to receive objections and representations, not only from all the sections of the industry, and of the rayon industry, but also from the consumers. All those considerations have to be weighed by the Cotton Industry Advisory Committee, and then they have to send their report to the Board of Trade. The Board of Trade then have to consider the scheme, with all the objections and representations, and they may modify the scheme. If the scheme is modified, then you might have to have another poll to see whether the modifications are agreeable to the various sections.<br><br>
In view of that elaborate procedure, one can see that a very considerable time will be taken up before a scheme is propounded and has a chance of coming into operation. But there is one great objection to insisting on a Negative Resolution with regard to a price-fixing scheme, and that is that it has to lie on the Table of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0332">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 667</span>
the House for 28 days, and it cannot lie on the Table unless the House is sitting. There may be further causes of delay, because the House may not be sitting for three months, or even longer, and that would mean with regard to a price-fixing scheme starting any time in the Spring that there would be no chance of getting it through till towards the end of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammersley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is this period of 28 days a real safeguard, or is it merely delay? I think the Committee would like to know that. Is it a fact that if a scheme lies on the Table for 28 days nothing can be done, and it merely delays it; or does that interval provide an opportunity for the House to express its opinion?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is the Prayer. You have to get 40 Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir C. Entwistle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When you come to your price-fixing scheme, not only have you got all these safeguards, but you have the very definite standards arid conditions laid down in Clause 9, which is the Clause dealing with price-fixing schemes on which this Committee has taken so much time. I submit that a price-fixing scheme is most rigidly controlled now by the detailed provisions of Clause 9. In fact, so many safeguards and conditions and standards either are in that Clause now or have been promised to be put in by the President of the Board of Trade, that I really think there will be very little more that the scheme itself will be able to contain; because the scheme will not contain the price list itself, and detained conditions and safeguards are now specified so closely in Clause 9 that I am sure there is nothing left in the way of supervision which would be required by the—I submit unnecessary—procedure of laying a price-fixing scheme for 28 days on the Table of the House, subject to the procedure of a Prayer with a view to a Negative Resolution. The price-fixing scheme will now have all the conditions so laid down, all the standards so precisely specified, that there is no need for further Parliamentary control. And the Committee will remember that one of the provisions that are to be inserted in Clause 9 is that any individual can sell at a price below a minimum price list, provided he can prove that his own costs of production
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 668</span>
are below the costs provided in the price fixed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. and learned Gentleman says is rather important. I am glad to know from him that the opinion of the Joint Committee agrees with mine. What I said on Clause 9 is that anybody who could claim that his cost of production was lower than the price list would be able to go to the Board and get this exemption.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir C. Entwistle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that I am not intending to say anything more than I have said in my previous speech. Of course, cost of production is a question of definition—it is subject to all that I have said about depreciation and return on capital. I only meant to say that whatever provision this Committee agrees to on Clause 9, on the question of an individual being able to sell below the price list, is a very important further safeguard above and beyond those already existing. In these circumstances I hope the Committee will regard this Amendment as reasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have on the Paper an Amendment, in page 21, line 42, to leave out Sub-section (6), and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"(6) A sectional scheme shall not have any effect unless both Houses of Parliament by resolution approve the draft thereof but upon such approval being given the Board of Trade may make an order confirming the scheme in the form in which it has been so approved and upon such order being made the scheme shall lie of full force and effect."</p></blockquote>
I take it we are discussing my Amendment together with this, because it raises the same issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the point made by the hon. and learned Gentleman with regard to delay and to a substantial extent my Amendment would remove that difficulty, because the Board of Trade, who would be responsible for moving the Resolution can take it as quickly as they like. They need not wait for 28 days.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir C. Entwistle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not only the 28 days, it is a question of whether Parliament is sitting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have had experience, and I know that where Orders have to be laid everybody gets busy when they know that a critical date is approaching. They
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0333">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 669</span>
know that if they cannot get the Order in draft before the 25th July they have to wait till November.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman would bear that argument in mind with regard to the discussions of this Committee on the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not spoken at very great length, because I do not believe in wasting time. There is one consideration that the hon. and learned Gentleman put before us which I do not think is quite valid. He said that all the interests of the consumers would be taken into account. If he meant the ultimate consuming public it does not seem to me they are protected at any stage, except that the President of the Board of Trade has the responsibility for the whole community and he may be reluctant to approve a scheme which will involve a substantial increase in the cost of living. But the sole object of price-fixing schemes is to raise the cost of living. That may be justifiable or not, but do not let anybody suppose that the object of the Bill is to prevent a rise in the cost of living.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir C. Entwistle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I point out that under another provision in the Bill a committee has to report on whether a scheme is against the interests of the consumers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad the hon. and learned Member has drawn attention to that, but the ultimate protectors of the consumers are Parliament, and the reason why I think price schemes ought to receive the approval of Parliament is because of their effect on the consuming public, and I think we ought not to withdraw from the consuming public the protection which Parliament may be in a position to give them. For that reason I cannot agree with this proposal. And with regard to the position generally, I hope that we shall have the system of an affirmative resolution rather than the system of prayer. We know how difficult it is to organise a Prayer. The business comes up at n o'clock at night. It is easy if it happens that the opposition is being got up by one of the organised parties, because they have all their mechanism of Whips, they have a status, they can always keep a House, and so on.<br><br>
Let us take the case where the opposition is got up by a group of Members re-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 670</span>
presenting a certain number of constituuencies which may be adversely affected. They have to go to their friends and endeavour to get people to promise to stay after n o'clock in order to keep a quorum, and if there are less than 40 Members in the Chamber anyone can draw attention to that fact. It seems to be very unsatisfactory that in respect to something which involves the freedom of people to decide at what price they will sell things, and also something which decides what is to be the magnitude of the productive capacity of an industry—because that is what we are deciding under a redundancy scheme—it should be subject to such a hazardous procedure. Therefore I think the Affirmative Resolution ought to be the procedure adopted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rhys Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With his great knowledge of these matters, can the hon. Member tell us whether there is any precedent for what he is now suggesting?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Orders under the Import Duties Advisory Committee—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Member asking for a precedent for this kind of thing being done by Affirmative Resolution?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With regard to a price-fixing scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Orders under the Agricultural Marketing Acts are analogous. We had to approve the hops scheme and the milk Orders. All those are, in effect, price-fixing schemes. Offhand, I cannot say whether it was by Prayer or not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was not by agreement, but by Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree. This is an Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an agreement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the Parliamentary sense, it is an Order, however it has been arrived at. Having regard to the quite serious economic and constitutional aspects of this matter, I think there would be advantages in having an Affirmative Resolution. There is the further advantage that it is a quicker procedure. If the Chief Whip were here, he would be against an Affirmative Resolution, because he has to deal with the eternal problem of getting business through. It is not his
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0334">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 671</span>
business to have a conscience. We all know that when he is acting as Chief Whip, he has no conscience, although he has one otherwise. His sole concern is to accomplish the Government's programme, and always the influence of the Whips is against us on the question of an Affirmative Resolution, because each time that is provided for in an Act of Parliament, the Chief Whip sees that another half day is going to be lost the next Session. On the other hand, because of the importance of the issue involved, I think the case for an Affirmative Resolution is a strong one. I will go further and say that it would much increase the confidence of those people who, like myself, do not like this kind of legislation, if we knew that there was to be the ultimate safeguard of an Affirmative Resolution. I hope that my right hon. Friend will give serious consideration to the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the matter is obviously one of considerable importance, on which a number of hon. Members want to speak, and as it has now been put from two angles, I think it might be convenient now to adjourn the Committee.</span></p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended at Three Minutes after One o'Clock until Four o'Clock.</i></p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>:</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not rise immediately before the luncheon adjournment because a number of hon. Members rose and seemed to want to continue the discussion. Although I am all for the proceedings being shortened, this is an important matter for private Members, and I do not want it to be rushed through in a hurry. The point here is quite a simple one, which every Member has to decide for himself. On the one hand, there is a general desire, I think, for speed. Even the people who oppose the Bill and think that the schemes are not likely to do much good to the industry are agreed that, if the Bill is to operate, it should operate without undue delay, and that whatever good there is in it should be tested out at the earliest possible opportunity. From that point of view, the Amendment with regard to price schemes and the relaxation of the obligation to submit them to Parliament might lead—one cannot put it higher than that—to a quickening process. That would not be so if, at the moment when the scheme
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 672</span>
was ready for submission to Parliament, Parliament was not sitting, and would not be sitting for some time.<br><br>
On the other hand, it is quite clear that the Amendment takes away from the private Member an opportunity of discussing something which may be of great importance to a number of people. Although it is quite clear that there will be subsequent occasions—on the Board of Trade Vote or by questions—when the scheme is in operation when they will be able to find out the effect, they will be deprived of an opportunity of expressing an opinion before the scheme is brought into effect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir C. Entwistle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend think that there is any substantial point which will be affected which is not already covered by the Clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would be much easier to answer if Clause 9 in its final form had now been before the Committee? I have been in some communication with the Joint Committee on this question, and the communications I have had so far do not fill me with hope that this Clause is going to be of such a definite and acceptable character that it will make subsequent discussion unnecessary. It may be that we shall get on better than at the moment seems likely; but I certainly could not answer that question when the final form of the Clause is not settled. The fact remains that the House will have to go without this form of discussion.<br><br>
Whether the Committee accepts or rejects the Amendment of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Bolton (Sir C. Entwistle), there is something to be said, from the point of view of speed, for the Amendment of the hon. Member for South Croydon (Sir H. Williams). At any rate, that obviates the necessity for the scheme lying on the Table for 28 days, and it is possible to get an affirmative Resolution through both Houses—although the procedure is somewhat slower sometimes in another place than in the House of Commons—in less than 28 days. So I shall recommend the Committee to accept the Amendment of the hon. Member for South Croydon. I find myself in great difficulty with regard to the Amendment we are now discussing. I am very much impressed with the arguments for speed. I dislike the idea that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0335">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 673</span>
a scheme of very great importance may be held up for three or four months because the House is not sitting. Nevertheless, I do not like the idea of a Minister trying to press private Members to take away from themselves what they feel is a just right, and I must leave it to them whether they are prepared, in the interests of speed, to surrender their undoubted right to have a discussion on this. If we can get a really satisfactory new Clause 9, which lays down, with some precision and to the general satisfaction, the framework in which the general price scheme can be fitted, that might have a very great influence upon hon. Members. Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to get that Clause.<br><br>
I wonder whether this would be a satisfactory solution. It seems to me a matter of so much importance to the private individual that I am not prepared to influence or to try and compel hon. Members to vote one way or the other. As a Minister I do not want myself to come to a decision on what really affects private Members' rights, but the Committee, if they are impressed by this need for speed, might accept the Amendment of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Bolton. They will have an opportunity before the Committee stage ends of seeing the new Clause 9. If they are not satisfied that the Clause really fulfils what we hope for it, this matter can be raised again on another stage, and, if necessary, it can then be reversed. I am hoping that it will still be possible to devise Amendments to Clause 9 which will prove satisfactory, and which will go a long way towards persuading people that it will be unnecessary to have this further discussion in Parliament. If hon. Members accepted the Amendment of the hon. and learned Member for Bolton it could only be on the understanding that it, on consideration of these Amendments, they were found to be unsatisfactory, the matter would be reopened on the Report stage. I am only throwing that out as advice, and if it goes to a Division I do not myself propose to take part in the Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dodd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I put my name to this Amendment. In paragraph (<i>a</i>) the Board referred to, if the phraseology is correct, is the Board of Trade. There are two Boards referred to in Clause 16; the Board of Trade and the Cotton Industry Board.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 674</span>
If the Amendment is accepted by the Committee, the whole of the scheme will have gone through all the processes laid down in the Bill, and it amounts to the Board of Trade being allowed to decide on a price-fixing scheme without reference to Parliament. That is not a principle that Members of Parliament would like as a rule, but there are two or three factors which might be considered. Under the Bill the procedure in respect of any scheme will occupy several months between the introduction of the scheme and the time when it reaches the Board of Trade. Unfortunately, the cotton trade is particularly seasonal. If you had a scheme introduced early in the year, with the Summer Recess coming on, it might not be possible, in view of the 28 days for which it has to lie on the Table, to get the scheme—which might have been introduced in January or February—through until possibly October or November, by which time conditions might have changed considerably. That applies especially in the American section, where prices are governed to a great extent by American crop prices and conditions, which are naturally not known until the late summer or early autumn. A scheme introduced early in the year might not be suitable after all that delay.<br><br>
While it is asking rather a lot to ask Private Members to give away willingly the right of vetoing schemes, let me point out that the scheme will have gone through all the processes laid down in the Bill and have been approved by the Board of Trade. Suppose that it then comes to the House for confirmation. On purely practical grounds, most measures which have been introduced into the House with the backing of a Minister will get the approval of the House, though, of course, the Amendment means that one does lose the chance of expressing one's opinions when the affirmative Resolutions are asked for. On the other hand hon. Members will have the opportunity of raising questions about a scheme through the ordinary Parliamentary procedure. Delays of three or four months might so considerably alter conditions that I think there is much to be said in favour of this Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Petherick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think my hon. Friend who has just sat down is under some misapprehension, because when his scheme was laid before Parliament I imagine it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0336">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 675</span>
would not contain any prices, but they will subsequently be filled in. It will be the bare outline of this scheme without prices. Obviously you cannot possibly put before Parliament the exact prices which it is proposed to enter. It seems to me that apart from the Amendment in the name of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Bolton (Sir C. Entwistle)—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dodd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to assure the Committee that I am not under any misapprehension at all. This scheme as a scheme will not affect prices from one moment to another, but there is considerable variation between Indian cotton, American cotton, Egyptian cotton and other kinds, and with prices fluctuating there is very often a movement, say, from American to Egyptian, and from Egyptian to American or Indian, and a scheme produced at a particular moment which might cover Indian users might not cover people three or four months later who want to come in from American cotton. It is not on the basis of price but conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Petherick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has explained his view quite clearly, but I imagine that the scheme would not be so rigidly drawn up as to give no elasticity whatever when finally brought into practice. We have three courses, one being to adopt the Amendment of the hon. and learned Member for Bolton, but I think that is one which should not be accepted. I think these schemes of sufficient importance for Parliament to take an interest in them. The two other courses are that we should either proceed by means of Affirmative Resolution, the course preferred by my recently ennobled friend the Member for South Croydon (Sir H. Williams) and the other one is to proceed by the method as adopted in the Bill. I prefer the Bill as it stands. I think the House should have some opportunity, if they wish, for discussion. Suppose we proceed with Affirmative Resolution, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Croydon suggests, it is quite true that it may go through more quickly than otherwise. That is to say, if the Whips can find time out of Government time; but on the other hand, it might get held up for a considerable period. If, on the other hand, we proceed by the method put down in the Bill, if
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 676</span>
an hon. Member feels sufficiently strongly that the scheme is a bad one he can move a Prayer to reject it, and that seems to me, on the whole, a better method, if he can keep a House. If he feels strongly about it, it is presumably a very serious point on which other hon. Members feel acutely too. If it is not so serious as all that, and he is not able to keep a House, I think he deserves to fail. On the whole, where a matter is very important, I should prefer to proceed by the method suggested by the hon. Member for South Croydon, but in this particular case it is a highly technical matter. I do not think there is much in the argument for speed one way or another, and I should personally prefer to leave the Clause as it stands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Amendment moved by the hon. and learned Member for Bolton will be accepted. It only refers to a price scheme. So far as redundancy schemes are concerned they stand in the Amendment just as in the Bill, and the redundancy schemes are the only ones where public moneys are concerned. The Committee will be aware that we have already spent a very considerable time getting through these Clauses, and at this speed it does not appear that we shall have an opportunity of getting this Bill before the end of the month. That being so, it is quite obvious that no scheme can be put into operation before Parliament rises, as we expect to do at the end of July. So far as Lancashire is concerned, the position is urgent. There have been sufficient guarantees and safeguards given for the price-fixing scheme under Clause 9 already to justify us in saying that when that scheme, which has all the safeguards in the Bill to begin with, and those further incorporated in the Bill and all the compromises made—when this thing has finally gone through the Committee and the House of Commons it can be imagined that the matter should proceed without a further period of 28 days delay. I therefore hope that the Committee will accept the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having listened to the Debate I see there are defects both in my proposal and in that of the hon. and learned Gentleman. As an alternative I suggest this, which I think will meet with approval, that we should adopt the procedure which operates under the Import Duties Act. Obviously, it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0337">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 677</span>
necessary if you are introducing an Import Duty that it should come into operation quickly, otherwise it may be defeated by anticipatory dumping. Most such Orders operate within three days of date but lapse unless subsequently confirmed within a stated number of days. I think the same procedure might operate here, and a scheme, if approved by the Board of Trade, be brought into operation but within so many days of Parliament sitting it should require confirmation by an Affirmative Resolution. In that way, we safeguard the public interest and get more speed than you get under the Bill or the proposal of my hon. and learned Friend.<br><br>
The one possible defect is, what will happen to any draft made when that scheme is in operation if that scheme is subsequently anulled through the action of Parliament? There are a good number of cases laid down in such Orders that anything done under the scheme is in order even if subsequently anulled. I should not like to commit myself without examining the proposal fully, but it seems an alternative solution. We think the subject vital but we want an effective safeguard. I would suggest to my hon. and learned Friend that he should withdraw his Amendment, that I should not move mine, and that the President of the Board of Trade should examine my present proposal to see if it is a workable scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Levy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support what the hon. Member for South Croydon said, and in view of what my right hon. Friend has said I appreciate to the full that the last thing he desires to do is to take away from any private Member any right of discussion or any of those possibilities on the Floor of the House. He deprecates—he will correct me in this if I am wrong—delegating powers to permanent officials.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The power is left with me and I am not a permanent official.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Levy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was hoping my right hon. Friend would become a permanent official, but there are changes of Ministry more frequently, if I may say so, than changes of permanent officials, and I feel there are a number of interests in the House of Commons represented by private Members, and those Members cannot all serve on a Committe of this kind. Therefore, it is essential that a scheme of any kind
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 678</span>
such as this should have the assent of Parliament to enable the private Member to enjoy the right to which he is entitled, and to discuss. We have all had experience of Prayers. I remember a case not very long ago where a Minister had power dedicated to him in which before he could bring any particular scheme into operation he had to lay a Paper upon the Table for 28 days, and after that it would operate. In this particular case, which is appropriate to this matter, the scheme was put into operation before the Paper was laid. The scheme was already in operation when the Paper was laid, and when we put down a Prayer subsequently to discuss it we were amazed to find that although under the Act of Parliament that scheme could not be put into operation until the Paper had been laid 28 days, we found that the scheme was in operation prior even to the laying of the Paper. In view of that experience, I agree with my right hon. Friend, and I think as we are all here as Members of Parliament, and all very jealous of the rights of private Members, we should do nothing to jeopardise those rights. Whatever method is adopted I do not mind, but confirmation of both Houses of Parliament should be essential before any of these schemes are put into operation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not feel too happy about the suggestion of the hon. Member for South Croydon that we should adopt in relation to schemes under this Bill the procedure followed in the case of Import Duties. After all, the Import Duty scheme has not provided very happy opportunities in the House for Debate, although I agree that, generally speaking, there were fuller opportunities than by the method of the Prayer. Even with Import Duties Orders the invariable practice has been for them to come on unduly late, at a time when it is difficult for them to get the interest of the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Wiiliams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is true now, but I think if the hon. Member will carry his memory back to the earlier Orders when the issue was regarded as much more constitutional, he will find that they were taken at an earlier time of the day. It is only recently, when the trouble has to a large extent ceased, that they are taken late at night.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the practice which has developed recently that I was think-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0338">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 679</span>
ing about, but that was not my main point. My main point is that the procedure with regard to the Import Duties is that the decision of the Import Duties Advisory Committee, and in this case of the President of the Board of Trade, has immediate effect. Then you see in the case of Import Duties you are dealing with goods being imported into this country. It does not affect the relationship of manufacturers, or dealers, or people engaged in commerce or industry in this country. With regard to this Bill and a scheme like a price scheme, as I see it in this case it would affect prices of goods immediately, and it appears to me that if the House of Commons was confronted with the position that, we will say, a price scheme had already been allowed to operate, for the advantage of speed by the Board of Trade, the House would be in a considerable difficulty in rejecting that scheme subsequently, even if it was entitled to do so on the scheme's merits, if the whole trade had adjusted itself to different prices.<br><br>
It appears to me that whilst the hon. Member for Croydon might be aiming to get speed with regard to the putting into operation of the scheme, and safeguarding the right of Parliament to discuss it, it is a different problem here from the circumstances that arose in regard to import duties. I should not like to commit myself on that procedure until I felt that it had been more thoroughly examined by both the Board of Trade and this Committee, or before we let the present provision pass, more or less to commit ourselves to the procedure of the Import Duties Advisory Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammersley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think there is a general unanimity of opinion in the Committee that there should be no delay in a desirable scheme. At the same time there is great anxiety that there should be no weakening of safeguards against an undesirable scheme. In these matters the question of safeguards is one of very great moment to the people actually engaged in the industry. If prices are fixed unjustly some discrimination and great injustice is done. It is true that any Order will have to go through a great process of examination, but I have always considered that the great safeguard lies in the way the question of cost has to be decided, and that is going to consist in details which are to be laid down in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 680</span>
Amendments to Clause 9, which we have not in front of us. That is a matter of great difficulty, because the real safeguard of the individual affected by a price scheme will be (1) that he will know how he has to fix his costs, and (2) he will have an opportunity under the Bill, if he is an exceptionally low-cost producer, of getting an amendment to the price scheme. We have in front of us a proposal by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Bolton (Sir C. Entwistle), and two from the hon. Member for South Croydon (Sir H. Williams), and we have to try to arrive at a decision. Amongst all these varied ideas it seems to me that the last suggestion for a Provisional Order would probably be the one which met the case without doing away with the necessary safeguard which we desire to maintain, and I hope that may be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no desire, as probably the latest comer to the Committee and to Parliament, to restrict the rights of the Private Member, although I must confess that during the 18 months I have been present I have not noticed any particular Prayer of a Private Member being answered, particularly, when you have to guarantee the answer yourself, because you have to have sufficient Members interested to retain a House. That, it seems to me, would be a difficulty. I have no desire to restrict the rights of hon. Members unduly, but it did seem to me when I put my name to this Amendment that, with all the procedure outlined in the Bill—against which complaints have been heaped up from the beginning by opponents and supporters alike, as to the delay that was necessary in order that all the safeguards regarded as essential could be gone through—what there was left for Parliament to aim at, either by Prayer, or sanction, or otherwise, was very small with regard to price schemes.<br><br>
Whatever the suggestion may be with regard to price schemes, my principal reason for supporting this Amendment, in addition to gaining speed, is that it retains the month during which the redundancy scheme shall lie upon the Table. I see there a greater necessity for the rights of the Private Member of Parliament being retained, not only because money that has been subscribed by the Government is involved and loans raised in which they have an interest, but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0339">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 681</span>
because the redundancy schemes will affect more directly Members of Parliament who are responsible for areas and for looking into a number of things with regard to redundancy schemes. Therefore I want that provision to be retained under whatever method we devise. I do not know sufficient about the working of the Imports Duties Orders to be able to say whether or not the scheme outlined briefly by the hon. Member for South Croydon would meet the case, but it seemed to me that in his suggestion there was something which would help us to get speed as well as to retain the overriding interest of Parliament at the same time. I hope, therefore, the President of the Board of Trade will be in a position to accept what I might call the spirit of these two Amendments and look at them with a view to getting the suggestion in concrete form.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is quite clear that the Committee wants to combine, as most people do, the two irreconcilables—speed, and full opportunity for discussion. My hon. Friend the Member for South Croydon, who was referred to as recently ennobled but to whom I prefer to refer as "my be-knighted friend"—has made a very ingenious suggestion in an attempt to combine those two virtues. Like the hon. Member I should certainly not like—and I do not think anybody here would like, here and now, to say that we think that is either practicable or desirable. It will certainly want a good deal more consideration, but I am prepared to give consideration to it. I do not think, as a matter of fact, that the chief difficulties arise from the point of view of administration. It is a suggestion that will have to be very carefully considered by those who will be responsible, when the Bill is passed, for the administration of any scheme that is put up. They must be fully seized of the effects which might be caused by the subsequent rejection of a scheme by Parliament, and they must be quite convinced that the effects are not so grave as to outweigh entirely the advantage of the speed which is gained. It will, therefore, need a considerable amount of consultation with those interests. I am prepared, between now and Report stage, to go into the matter and, if I believe it is practicable and the interests concerned feel that the disadvantages can be overcome, I shall be perfectly
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 682</span>
prepared to put an Amendment of this kind down at a subsequent stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like it to be clear, before the Minister resumes his seat, that what he is thinking of is the price-fixing scheme and not the redundancy scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad the hon. Member has made that point. It is quite clear that a suggestion of this kind would not be applicable to the redundancy scheme. That must be dealt with in the ordinary way, either by negative or positive Resolution. Any idea of this kind would be applicable only to a price scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman said he would be prepared to put down an Amendment. Would it be along the lines of the suggestion made by the hon. Member for South Croydon?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To examine it and, if I am convinced that it is practicable and desirable, to put it down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the right hon. Gentleman to bear in mind the special point I made, that in the case of price schemes you are actually dealing with commodities which, having been produced, are immediately sold in this country, whereas with import duties you are not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think we are all conscious of that, and what the people responsible for the price scheme will have to consider is, that you may bring a price scheme into operation, you may enter into contracts on the basis of that, and then you may have the House rejecting the scheme. The price fixing would come to an end, with a subsequent fall in prices, and some of those contracts might be entered into at a loss. That is what people must have in mind, and I want to be quite certain that they have that kind of thing in mind and still want to go on, before I would adopt the suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not only a question of whether the House might reject the scheme, and the difficulties that would arise, but it is prejudicing the position of hon. Members when they come to discuss the scheme, if it is already in operation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir C. Entwistle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I moved my Amendment I had no desire to remove any Parliamentary control in these
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0340">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 683</span>
schemes which was in any way necessary or important. My whole purpose was to save time because of the urgency of dealing with this problem. I personally am and, as far as I can make out, the Joint Committee are, only too anxious that any reasonable Parliamentary control shall be preserved if this question of time can be dealt with. The hon. Member for South Croydon said that his Amendment saved time, whereas very little time is saved. It is true an Affirmative Resolution might be brought forward before the 28 days have expired, whereas with a Negative Resolution it would be necessary to wait for the whole 28 days to pass. On the other hand, the President of the Board of Trade said that the Amendment on the Order Paper wants an Affirmative Resolution of both Houses, and that is hardly likely earlier than 28 days. So I do not think the Amendment would save any time. The Provisional Order procedure, suggested as a second alternative by the hon. Member for South Croydon, would certainly save time, but the trade itself ought to have time to consider the implications of this. As far as I know they will be willing to accept it. I take it that the President of the Board of Trade means that this Committee seems to be in favour of this procedure and, if he finds it practicable and there are no real objections to it, in the working of it, he will put down an Amendment on Report stage. I hope that has correctly represented his view, and on that I beg leave to withdraw my Amendment.</span></p>

The purpose of this Amendment is fairly clear. As the Bill stands, the operation is for 15 years. Sub-section (6) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Every redundancy scheme shall, unless previously revoked, expire on the fifteenth anniversary of the day on which it came into operation."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 684</span>
I am suggesting that we should limit the period more definitely by making it 15 years from the date on which the Act came into operation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. That is not what the hon. Gentleman is trying to do. He is trying to limit the price schemes expiring in the fifth year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Thank you. As a matter of fact, I was desirous of doing both, and through an inadvertence I only tabled one Amendment instead of both, but I was reading line 19 instead of line 22. As I have not tabled the other Amendment, I can only discuss the one on the Order Paper, namely, that a price scheme shall not run for more than five years beyond the life of the Act. As there may be a considerable lapse between the passage of the Act and the first operation of a price scheme, we may be pledging the future for a much longer period ahead than we think, and therefore we should make it for not more than five years from the date of the Royal Assent to this Act. Then, if it is found desirable that the scheme should be continued, the continuing Act will have to be introduced earlier than otherwise would be the case. I hope the President of the Board of Trade will give consideration to this, and, if he is willing to accept the Amendment, I will make good my omission when we come to the Report stage and move a similar Amendment, which I ought to have done for line 19.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is certainly not an Amendment that I could invite the Committee to accept. Its intention, as far as the price scheme is concerned, is to limit the whole operation of the Act to five years. We feel that in limiting each price scheme to five years we have gone as far as is either reasonable or desirable. That means to say that after five years, when the price scheme comes to an end, the machinery will still be there, and if people in that section still want a price scheme they will have to reconsider the terms of the scheme and they will have to go through the machinery to introduce another. That does give safeguards for periodic revisions of the operation of these schemes, but it seems to me quite fantastic that we should put in the Bill a limitation of the whole life to five years.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0341">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 685</span>
Quite apart from the fact that after five years no scheme could operate at all, it would also mean that in each succeeding year the life of any scheme that people bring in is going to be shorter, that it is less and less worth their while to bring it in, and that in the last year or two of the period, in fact, no one would bring in a price scheme at all, because they would not go all through the laborious process which has been detailed for a scheme which will only have a few months' existence. It is a purely destructive Amendment, which is intended to render the whole of this price scheme inoperative. Therefore, I advise the Committee to reject it. I can only tell my hon. Friend that when at another stage he puts down the Amendment he forgot to put down at this stage, I shall give the same advice about that Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the explanation of the President of the Board of Trade, which convinces me that my Amendment was very much better than I thought it was, I beg leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>

This Amendment is not a destructive one but a very constructive one, and I hope that the President of the Board of Trade, in particular, and the Committee as a whole, will listen to the reasons as to the necessity for this Amendment, and that they will give consideration to those reasons. In the first place, I understand that suggestions of this character were made during the consultations and negotiations that took place between all interests affected by this Bill, but owing to a number of criticisms that were made the representatives, rather than risk the loss of the Bill, agreed to withdraw the proposal. When we first suggested this, we had no knowledge that it had been considered by the Joint Committee.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 686</span>
I want to appeal to the Committee to think of the economic interests of the nation as a whole and not of the economic position of the cotton industry within the limits of the cotton industry itself. This country is a relatively small country; it has a huge population that depends for its livelihood upon the relative prosperity of all industries, and I believe we have arrived at a time when industry will have to consider something of this character. Therefore, rather than limit ourselves to the cotton industry, I hope that we are going to think of the economic needs of the country as a whole. In my view, this proposal will help to increase the output of the cotton industry and will assist in that direction. Therefore the Committee should be determined to improve the Bill, apart from the agreement arrived at. This Committee should, apart from the decision arrived at by the Joint Committee, consider this question from the point of view of increasing the export trade of this country.<br><br>
When this Bill becomes an Act of Parliament the home market will have received a certain amount of protection. I am not objecting to that, because I have never held the orthodox views of certain people, particularly prominent people who have been associated with our party; and I am not speaking critically of it. What I am stating is a fact, that when this Bill becomes an Act of Parliament the home market will be protected. Therefore, as long as the economic position of Britain remains as it is we are getting for the home market a relatively good market, and we say it is only fair that if the manufacturers engaged in producing for the home market are protected they ought to make a contribution to a pool which can be used to maintain our export trade and to recapture our export trade where we have lost it.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I agree with the hon. Member for South Croydon (Sir H. Williams). It is a nasty word, and I would not be a party to doing that in its generally accepted sense, but we are dealing with a new type of people, and seeing that they are challenging us in the

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 687</span>
way they are, we can only meet them in the way some of us are prepared to do. If we are not prepared to do it this afternoon, it is only a matter of time before we are forced to do it. This Committee accepts my point of view or not. It has been my lot in life to agitate for certain reforms. That has been the experience of certain hon. Members who now see a Minister of Supply introduced after four or five years' agitation.<br><br>
The point I wish to make is this: the methods we are suggesting will help us to increase our export trade and at the same time will assist in bringing about larger turnover in the industry which should reduce capital charges, and overhead charges. In this way, providing that the safeguards which the President of the Board of Trade has assured us in this Committee, time after time, are going to be carried out, it ought to assist in reducing the prices in this country, and also the prices of our commodities abroad, at the same time assisting us to increase our export trade. Therefore, we wish that firms making over a certain percentage of profit whether catering for the export trade or the home market—and I am dealing more particularly with the home market—ought to contribute a percentage of that percentage to a pool which can be used in the direction that we are advocating. This Bill would then form the basis for an export pool.<br><br>
Seeing what we are having to face throughout the world, those who are dealing with the Far Eastern situation are bound to be concerned. It is not a political issue. The whole of our interests are involved in this question, and if we are going to maintain the relative standard of living we have reached we shall be forced to consider something of this kind. Certain countries with which we are in competition are prepared to carry out any form of subsidy in order that they may capture our trade in other parts of the world. The standard of living of their people is such that our people would never stand for it. If we are going to maintain our trade in face of that competition, based upon conditions of that character, we shall be forced to do something of the kind suggested in the Amendment.<br><br>
I understand that the only objections raised in the industry are two. First of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 688</span>
all, that the proposal would raise prices. Our reply is that if this is managed scientifically it would reduce prices. Secondly, some people with the orthodox free trade outlook are of opinion that it would lead to retaliation. I have no doubt a certain amount of retaliation would take place, but we are living in a world as it is and not as many of us would like it to be, and seeing that in certain countries they suppress the whole of the people's lives in order that they can be ruthlessly exploited for the purpose of monopoly capitalisation, we shall be bound some day to do something of this character. It may be that the Members of this Committee have not yet made up their minds with regard to this question. Certain people in high places are not yet convinced of the necessity for this, but anyone who has followed developments throughout the world and is in direct touch with industry in the industrial centres and with industrial capital will be aware of the very serious position of many of our big industries. Therefore to be fair to the cotton industry this Committee ought to agree to a proposal of this character.<br><br>
Some hon. Members may think this Amendment would create a precedent and so it is in one sense, but similar proposals are already in being. There is a selling scheme for the mining industry and a selling scheme for the iron industry, where the consumers of steel have not got the same safeguards that the cotton people will have. In addition to that, we say that industry in this country should have more bargaining power. It is not right to send our representatives out to face this subsidised foreign competition; they ought to have more bargaining power in order to meet these foreign competitors on the same basis. I believe that more and more we are entering into a position in industry when a barter system of trade will have to be carried out. Already the Government have embarked on a policy of that kind, within very narrow limits. I believe the worsening of the international situation will force us to embark on a policy of bulk trading and agreements as arrived at with France, as far as coal is concerned, and with America in the commercial agreement negotiated by the Board of Trade. That agreement was to their everlasting credit, considering the opposition they had to contend with in certain quarters. With the Federation of British Industries
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0343">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 689</span>
against them, it was to their credit that they so successfully carried it through. I believe that more and more industry will be forced to carry on negotiations in that way. Therefore, seeing that we are legislating for the cotton industry we ought to agree to such a proposal in order that that industry can be organised on a scientific basis and an instrument can be placed in the hands of the representatives of the Board of Trade and representatives of the cotton industry so that they can meet this foreign competition in a better way than is possible at the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bracken</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member talked about a certain percentage. There is nothing about a percentage in his Amendment. Secondly, he has not told us why the people in Lancashire refused this proposal. I understand the cotton industry is a very poor industry and could not afford levies. It seems to me amazing that such a proposal should come from a person of the hon. Member's political views. If the hon. Member for Bournemouth (Sir Henry Croft) were here I might understand it. I should like to know what the great co-operative societies say to this idea. I should like to hear their views on this question. When the hon. Member talks about the time coming when we shall all go in for barter trade, how would his Amendment be of assistance to that? He has cancelled out the whole case for his Amendment by his own unaided efforts. I do not think very much of this Bill, but I could not support it at all if the proposal made by the hon. Member were accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I invite the Committee to accept the Amendment. I think it is pretty generally known that the original proposals of those in the industry who sponsored this scheme included one very similar to this, and that ultimately it was withdrawn for a reason which I find it very difficult to understand. I think the suggestion was made that such a levy would be too heavy a financial burden upon the industry. I do not think it would be a heavy financial burden, and in any case I suppose the amount of it would be subject to some kind of agreement. Unless the scheme is designed to assist the export trade I do not know what it is for. To say that the cost of assisting the export trade in this industry is too great a burden for it, would seem to be a denial of the whole purpose of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 690</span>
Measure. It would have to be a very heavy burden indeed if it was not worth
while.<br><br>
Suggestions were made that perhaps other people would not like this levy. I do not know that that matters a great deal. Either the export trade in this industry is going to be assisted or the industry is going to die. I cannot for the life of me understand why those who with such great care, patience and diligence evolved this complicated machinery in order to assist themselves—and I hope it will assist them—had not the courage to go on with their original proposals and retain this idea of a central fund contributed to by all who will benefit by this legislation. The object of the fund would be to see that the whole purpose of this legislation, namely, the assistance of the export trade, was advanced. Lancashire is inhabited by a great number of people who have what they call traditions, and those traditions had to be reckoned with, and there had to be all kinds of concessions and allowances, all kinds of checks and counter-checks and balances and counter-balances, and in the general medley of negotiations this very valuable proposal was lost.<br><br>
By this Amendment we are proposing to bring it back. The hon. Member for North Paddington (Mr. Bracken) expressed some surprise at hearing such a proposal from the hon. Member for Stoke (Mr. Ellis Smith), and I suppose his surprise will extend to the rest of us who support the proposal. I do not know why he should be surprised. We have to make a great many things work in a world which we do not like and which we would willingly alter, but we look in vain to the hon. Member for his assistance when we want to alter them. I think there is a kind of Gresham's Law in politics and in economics as well as in currency, and that just as in the old days, when we had metal coinage instead of paper money, it was true that bad coinage tended to drive out good, so in economics and in politics bad ideas, bad systems and bad outlooks tend to drive out better ones.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is what happens in the Labour party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There may reasonably be a difference of opinion in politics and in economics—so different from coinage—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0344">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 691</span>
as to what are good and what are bad ideas, but if I can get the hon. Member's agreement that the bad does tend to drive out the good, then perhaps he will not in the future be so benighted as he has been in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bracken</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I presume the hon. Member is referring to the hon. Member for South Croydon.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am. He was good enough to interrupt me. If it is agreed that this kind of Imperialist economic rivalry which has been so intensified in recent years is a bad thing, I do not think hon. Members need be greatly surprised if all the rest of the world is dragged down, against its will, to a level not, I hope, as low as that of those who do the dragging, but at any rate lower than their own ideals. If that is going on and if the result is to bring disaster to our own people, then we on this side must do what we can to meet the challenge and to keep our heads above water until the storms die down and we can shape the course we should prefer. That is designed to combat any suggestion of dumping, but this Amendment did not of necessity involve any such thing. There is not a word in the Amendment to say that it means dumping.<br><br>
I can quite see how the hon. Member for Stoke was tempted to develop his argument, but there is nothing in the Amendment concerned with bulk purchasing, bulk trading or barter. All that the Amendment suggests is that there should be a fund and that all who will benefit by this legislation should contribute to it, that the fund should be centrally administered, and that it should be used in every legitimate way to assist the export trade of an industry which lives by its export trade almost exclusively. I hope that on this matter the Minister will be able to help the industry and give it a little of the courage which it will need if it is really to shape a more happy future than its past has been. I hope he will give it the courage which it did not have to proceed with this proposal, which it at first thought good, and rightly thought good. I hope the Committee will be able to give it the courage to do what it would have liked to do for itself but was afraid to attempt.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 692</span>
<p><span class='member'>Sir C. Entwistle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is quite true that a provision to this effect was contained in the original proposals of the Joint Committee but that it was withdrawn because objections were raised that it would cast a heavy burden upon the industry. I understand the view of the Joint Committee is that those fears were exaggerated, because the extent to which they would have utilised these powers would have depended on the willingness of the industry to bear the burden. But it is the fact that this proposal was withdrawn, and that it was not contained in the final proposals on which the Joint Committee vote was taken, nor was it contained in the Bill on which the vote of the industry was taken, and as it is a very important matter, which most people would regard as a fundamental one, I think it would be very undesirable to reintroduce it at this stage. I hope that, having regard to these facts, the proposers of the Amendment will see their way not to press it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Fildes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the very last occasions on which the hon. Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. Silverman) appeared in the country was when he was addressing a meeting of 20,000 people in Nelson in favour of holidays with pay in the cotton trade. If there is to be this multiplication of the charges thrust upon this industry we might as well join the suicides' club at once.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because of holidays with pay?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Fildes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In various ways there are attempts to handicap the competitive ability of this industry by imposing additional charges. It is a mistake to suppose that the cotton trade of the world as a whole is not good. In volume it is greater than at any time in its history, but, unfortunately, we cannot get our share, and that is due to the simple fact that we have got the dearest stall in the world market, and I resent very strongly any attempt to reduce our competitive ability in the markets of the world by adding to the burdens bearing upon the cotton trade.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member says that we have the dearest stall in the market. I hope that it is not proposed in this legislation to reduce wages.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Fildes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0345">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 693</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So it will remain the dearest stall in the world, and still we shall have to increase the export trade, unless the industry is to abandon all hope. Somebody in the industry will look round for ways of helping the export trade. Enterprising, go-ahead firms will spend money on trying to do so, and then others in the background will come along and reap the advantage. All that this Amendment suggests is that the money that is spent on assisting the export trade shall be contributed by all those who share in its benefits, that we shall not leave it to the volunteers who are progressive and go-ahead. I ask the hon. Member to tell us what is wrong with that proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Fildes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is wrong with it is that it is a proposal to make the necessities of the people of this country dear in order to provide things cheaply for the rest of the world. The principle is wrong, and it has only to be stated in those terms for it to be apparent. In the West African trade, for a few yards of stuff you get so many gallons of palm oil. You may be able to say: "We will reduce the price of our stuff to such an extent that the Indians who now compete in the market will be ruled out"; in another market you may say that you will do the same thing as regards the Japanese; but in the end the money will come out of the people at home here in the shape of increased prices for whatever they need to buy from the cotton trade.<br><br>
Look at the industry of corset manufacture. There is a big supply of corset material coming from America, and supplies coming also from France and from Belgium. The proposals in this Amendment could have only one result, to make the supply of that material in this country dearer. There is a big export trade in corsets, and it would put us out of the market. I say that the whole idea of making things dear for our people at home in order that we may supply the needs of the world more cheaply is bad. It is wrong to suggest these further increased charges. There are the increased charges falling upon the industry in the shape of increased wages—110 per cent. more in spinning and 80 per cent. more in weaving—then holidays with pay, then this additional levy, then the levy for redundant machinery. It will tax the industry out of existence. I trust that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 694</span>
the President of the Board of Trade will stand firm against the proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major Procter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment proposes to establish a fund to assist the export trade by the imposition of a levy, subject to such conditions as may be deemed proper on persons entered in the general register. I should like to comment on the forthright honesty of the mover. He was quite convinced that this levy would not have the effect of enabling the Board to dump materials in foreign lands. In spite of what his colleague the hon. Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. Silverman) said, there is nothing to be ashamed of in that. It was only an endeavour to excuse the taking up of a Protectionist attitude, so that he can explain the matter before his constituents without then taking umbrage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. and gallant Member does not wish to misrepresent me, and I hope that he will not attribute to me motives which I did not express, and which do not exist in my mind. I protest that I was not lacking either in forthrightness or straightforwardness in what I said, and I assure the hon. Member that the reasons I gave for supporting the Amendment I believe to be sound reasons, and that any such motive as he has attributed to me is not the case at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major Procter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With regard to motives which the hon. Member thinks I attributed to him, I certainly did not attribute any wrong motive. I know him quite well and on personal grounds have a great deal of regard for him, but I think he has done disservice to the cotton trade in trying to introduce this Amendment. He really believes that in certain directions we have a protected market, and from that he reasons that a protected market should help in the export trade. Turning to the Amendment proper, I do not know what is exactly meant by the
<br><blockquote><p>"imposition of a levy subject to such conditions as may be deemed proper."</p></blockquote>
I do not know what standard of proper-ness can be arrived at, or how you are going to get what may be proper. But that is all by the way. It is the principle of this Amendment with which I wish to deal. I know the difficulty of representatives of the Labour party in coming at this stage and putting forward this Amendment. They are precisely in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0346">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 695</span>
difficult position they were in when they brought forward their Amendment on behalf of the workers who were deemed redundant and who had been put out of employment. We know that all the members of the Labour party have great sympathy with these displaced workers, and the political representatives of that party felt that at least it should not go without some reference to the fact.<br><br>
Here, again, the precise situation existed when dealing with this matter as obtained when the redundancy scheme was discussed, that is, that you had a joint committee of the whole of the employers and the representatives of the trade unions. No one who knows the cotton trade would deny that the representatives of the trade unions of the cotton trade—I think there are 32 different unions—are in a capacity to deal with this business. Yet they came to the definite conclusion, and they agreed with the employers, that there was not sufficient money in the industry out of which they could subsidise the export of cotton goods. That is the truth in the case. I do not blame them for coming to that conclusion. It may have been necessary, but on other grounds I condemn both the trade union leaders and the employers, the trade union leaders particularly in the redundancy scheme, and now again in this.<br><br>
They first of all made it a condition of their support that the workers should be taken care of and, secondly, that this export levy should be granted. I blame them for surrendering the pass. That is to say, that in order to get this Bill through, the price of the passage of the Bill was that the redundant workers had to be cast aside with the levy for export business—the only valid reason for the production of this Bill. Both employers and representatives of trade unions did not have the nous to go together to the President of the Board of Trade, who will not mind my saying that he was sympathetic. I know he is vitally interested in cotton and in those who want to help the cotton trade, and he has been appealing year by year for the cotton trade to get together. If these powerful bodies had, I will not say, blackmailed the Government, but exercised their influence, they could have got considerably more than they are getting under the Bill.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 696</span>
It is too late now for the political representatives of the Labour Party to raise this point, but both they and the employers of labour should go to my right hon. Friend and Parliament and ask for assistance. We have a great, strong and powerful Government, and having regard to the contributions that Lancashire has made not only to Great Britain but to the whole of our Empire, they could go to the Government and ask for much more than this insignificant levy. It is trying to blow down Gibraltar with a peashooter if we expect the cotton industry, as it is to-day, to find sufficient money to carry out a strategic policy for the recapture of its overseas markets. I am wholeheartedly in sympathy with a subsidy for this purpose, utilising the home market as a sort of base, but expecting the ammunition to be supplied by the Government. If they can go forward on that line they will have my support, and I am sure that is the only way this can be done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure that I appreciate the hon. and gallant Member's position, but as it applies to the levy, he thinks it should come from the taxpayers as a whole and not from the millowners in his constituency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major Procter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely what I mean, for the reason that the cotton trade for years and years has contributed to the revenue of this country and relieved the taxpayers of a considerable amount both directly and because of the foreign currency it drew from other countries. Now, when the industry is in distress, and they have not the funds to carry out the strategic campaign of which I have spoken, I hope the Government will come in and with the help of the President of the Board of Trade in this matter we shall get a subsidy not of a few thousand pounds only but the great subsidy that is really needed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It appears to me that the longer the Debate goes on the more indiscriminate become the speakers. I hope I do not follow in that direction, but I want to submit to my hon. and gallant Friend that his mind is travelling in that direction, and that he should support us in proposing to transfer to the cotton industry the huge sums of money that have been paid to the beet sugar industry. Then we might support the idea. I would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0347">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 697</span>
have preferred to have reserved my remarks on this Clause to the Amendment in my name, but the trend of the Debate compels me to make my position clear before I cast a vote. I am prepared to support this Amendment on the wording of the Amendment and because it appears to me to emphasise the need of assisting the export side of the cotton industry. When I read Clause 18, except for the reference to promoting the development of the trade in export industry, it did not appear to me that Clause 18 emphasised sufficiently the main problem that has brought the industry to its present pass, and for that reason I was prepared to support this Amendment merely because it emphasised that problem.<br><br>
But I desire to make it clear that that support would have been conditioned by a subsequent Amendment that I have down in my name, that all these costs such as levies and registration fees and contributions of that kind should all be governed by the condition that they should not exceed 1 per cent. of the productive turnover, because one recognises that if this industry is going to get out of its financial difficulties it will not get out of them by adding to costs unduly. Whatever services are to be given by the investigation or help of the Cotton Industry Board must have some balance between the advantages given and the burdens imposed on production for the services rendered, and I felt in the Amendment that I propose to move subsequently that these levies should not exceed 1 per cent. of the productive turnover.<br><br>
When I listened to the speech of the hon. Member for Stoke (Mr. E. Smith) I knew he realised that 1 per cent. would not cover the ambitions he had in this direction, and I began to have a moment of nervousness as to whether my vote was being cast in the right direction. Having made that plain, I feel that the cotton industry on its export side must face certain circumstances that have developed in the world. It is not so much a question of the sum of money that you can bring out of this industry by a levy at this moment; but if you can get the right type of collaboration in the industry there ought to be a sufficient fund realised out of these service schemes to enable that type of collective investigation to be pursued in different markets of the world that may help the trade here and secure
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 698</span>
those necessary adjustments in organisation, methods of production, design, backing and things of that description that may enable it to go out after new markets.<br><br>
As I said on the Second Reading, there is either a mass market in the world or a specialised market for the British cotton industry, and when we look at the rates of pay and the costs of production in a mechanical industry of this kind in various other important centres of the world, I fail to see how we can get our productive costs down to some of the type of competition that prevails in the world. I would also say to my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke, whose opinion I value very much in this direction, that neither could a levy on the industry in its present state bridge those differences in the cost of production. I should like the right hon. Gentleman clearly to understand that I am not prejudicing my subsequent Amendment if I vote for the emphasis on the need for concentrating on the export side of the scheme. It is not that I necessarily accept the language of the mover of the Amendment, nor do I depart from the subsequent Amendment that I propose to move ultimately.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not proposing to call the subsequent Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not the 1 per cent. Amendment in Clause 19?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I only tell the hon. Member that now, because he has largely dealt with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment, although it did not go far enough for my hon. Friend who seems already to have gone still further himself, is nevertheless a very far-reaching Amendment. Hon. Members will realise that it introduces an entirely new conception into the Bill, and that it is a conception which is completely at variance with the whole principle of the structure that we have been building up in the Bill so far. As hon. Members have been speaking I have been wondering whether or not it would not be necessary, if an Amendment of this kind were accepted, to go so far as to take steps under this Bill compulsorily to rationalise the whole of the merchanting end of the business, if you were going to make an administrative success of operating a Bill of this kind.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 699</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That might be a good idea.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I quite appreciate the hon. Member would be glad to see that done, but I only mention it as an illustration of how far-reaching the effects of applying a principle of this kind would be. The hon. Member for Stoke spoke—and I for one agree with him—of the great importance in the national economic interests of the export trade. We all know how vastly beneficial the export trade in cotton goods has been to this country in the past, and we all realise also how extremely important it is that we should maintain and, if possible, increase it. Surely, that is also a thing which has been very much in the mind of the industry, of those, that is, who have brought forward these proposals from the start. It has been perfectly clear that those considerations have been foremost in their consciousness throughout the time when they have been developing these schemes. They propose to meet that in a different manner, not the manner of the hon. Member, which perhaps is a manner not as good as their own, but at any rate there are those proposals here in the Bill, and we have been discussing them, namely, that you should get a sufficiently remunerative price in markets where that is obtainable, to enable you to have a margin to make large enough concessions to be able to hold your own in, maybe even regain, certain overseas markets where competition is most intense.<br><br>
This Amendment suggests that there should be a levy, and as the hon. Member for East Ham, South (Mr. Barnes) pointed out, that levy would constitute an extremely heavy additional burden upon the industry. I think it would certainly mean that price concessions were impossible and, indeed, I take it that it would be intended to take the place of those price concessions. I mention that, again, to show that it would be necessary to recast the whole of the Bill if we were to accept an Amendment of this kind. These proposals are proposals which are, I suppose, to a great extent a compromise. Friends of hon. Members opposite have played some part in formulating them. Many other interests have played their part too, and I suppose none of them have been able to get 100 per cent. of the kind of scheme that they would like. I would suggest, further, that in any case
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 700</span>
a pool of this kind, definitely intended to subsidise exports, would be certain to attract anti-dumping restrictions of one kind or another in many overseas countries.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. E. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is there now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not in an anti-dumping form against the exports of this country. It would invite anti-dumping restrictions of one kind or another and, where you are faced with quotas or with currency exchange, there is no retaliation possible whatever. Again, where you are faced with a high tariff merely because you are subsidising your export, all you do in paying those subsidies is paying the tariff to subsidise foreign Governments and they can again raise the tariff to raise the subsidy and so render nugatory the whole purpose of your subsidy pool. In those circumstances we cannot accept this Amendment and I invite the Committee to reject it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say a word, not exactly in answer to the Parliamentary Secretary. It does not of necessity mean all the things that he has suggested, nor need it be so far-reaching in its implications. If I understand the Amendment—and I was responsible along with my hon. Friend for it being put down—it does give to the Cotton Industry Board power to impose a levy. It does not state what the levy shall be. Obviously, the Board is sufficiently realistic to understand whether or not the imposition of a levy would be economic or would be likely to cripple the industry. These are the people who know the most about the industry and what it would be able to stand. Nor does it seem to me to be of necessity a question of subsidising the export trade in the sense of cheapening its production in order to capture another market.<br><br>
I contend that there are many ways in which you can help the export trade other than by simply dumping your goods there at a very much cheaper rate than others. I want to suggest that there are more ways than one of winning a market, and that the best way of winning a market is probably not to flood it with a cheaper material than the one people are buying. I think my father had something to do with bringing me up on the line that the cheaper you could get a thing the better it was for you. I think we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0349">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 701</span>
are beginning to understand now that that is not the be-all and end-all either of business or of living to-day, and it is certainly not the be-all and end-all of a levy that is imposed for the purpose of assisting the export trade. I want this power in the hands of the Cotton Industry Board so that they may be able to impose a levy. It might be that it would only be a small levy. It might be that it could be increased as the industry recovered, if it does recover. It might be that it would call for more from the people who are doing well as the result of the passage of this Act of Parliament, and as a consequence will be in a position to give it. I want the Board to have the power to impose that.<br><br>
There is more than one duty on the part of business people to-day, and that is to see to it that not only they themselves are going ahead but that other people may be going ahead too. I know that it is not usual in Committee to quote Scripture, but I would like to suggest to the people who are objecting all the</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have received a manuscript Amendment from the hon. Member for South Croydon which I do not propose to call.</span></p>
<p>Motion made, and Question proposed, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill."</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to invite the Minister to make a statement on the Clause with regard to—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As it is only two minutes to six, and I think there are some other hon. Members who wish to make speeches on the Question "That the Clause stand part," would it not be more convenient to have the whole of the Debate at the next meeting?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not see any sign of any other hon. Member wishing to speak.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 702</span>
<p>time to paying that there is a Scriptural injunction which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves."</p></blockquote>
In the question of a levy it is not so much a question of seeking to impose a burden as rather seeking to give power to the Board—I was going to say, to ask for a levy in order that they may assist that portion of the trade.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Commander Agnew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman forgotten the injunction:
<br><blockquote><p>"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth?"</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, and I should like to assure the hon. and gallant Gentleman that I am quite familiar with that portion of the Scriptures too, but I believe it is the insistence upon laying up treasure on earth which has brought the cotton trade into the state it is in now.</span></p>
<p>Question put, "That those words be there inserted."</p>
<p>The Committee divided: Ayes, 4; Noes, 17.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Levy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to deal with the manuscript Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have made very little progress to-day, and though I certainly do not want to keep hon. Members later than necessary, it only means that we shall have to sit more in the future. If, however, it is for the convenience of the Committee to adjourn now, I am agreeable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let us get the Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought it quite possible to get the Clause this evening. Hon. Members would be prepared to stay, however long the hon. Gentleman speaks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. Fildes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we consent to stay now, will the President of the Board of Trade support a proposal that the Committee adjourn during Ascot week?</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 703</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I only raise this point for the purpose of inviting the Minister to make some statement of what are likely to be the obligations of all the service schemes on the industry. We have to recognise that because of the structure of the trade large organisations or combines will be in the position to obtain seats on the Cotton Industry Board and the Advisory Council and bodies of that character—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, I assume that the voting with regard to election—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not being voted on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is in the discretion of the Board of Trade?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I formed an impression that in the industry there was a pretty good idea as to what sections of the trade and what organisations were likely to secure representation, but whether my deductions or assumptions with regard to the composition of the Board are correct or not it does not materially affect the point I desire to raise, and that is, whether there will be any financial limit imposed as a result of these service schemes, or will the Cotton Industry Board have more or less unrestricted powers to incur expenses in connection with these various schemes with regard to the export side and home industry? Will the expenses be levied on these sections of the trade and not on the general register of everybody engaged in the industry? Will the total expenses in connection with these service schemes be limited to the sums shown in the Fifth Schedule? May we have an assurance that in no circumstances can other expenses be incurred? If that is the case, what is the reason for the ascending scale of expenses or costs? In these columns you will notice that in the first column it starts at £40,000 but in 1943 it rises to £50,000 or, with the consent of the Advisory Committee, to £60,000 and in the second column it will go up to as much as £75,000. I do not want to labour the point, I only wish the Minister to make some authoritative statement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Levy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I only rise to ask one of two questions. If we accept the fact that pure rayon can be and is being woven and comes within this scheme, since no
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 704</span>
Amendment or Committee is dealing with this, I want to know whether when we are dealing with paragraph (<i>a</i>), taking research regarding the manufacture of products of the industry, is pure rayon said to be a product of the industry? If so, do the Cotton Board consider themselves, with no expert knowledge at all, to be the right and proper body to deal with research of this kind? Or do they mean that they are going to have technical research regarding the manufacture of products? Does that mean only so far as mixtures are concerned? Can you get research into rayon as such? With regard to Subsection (<i>e</i>), I should like to know what this means:
<br><blockquote><p>"to negotiate with any person in respect to any matter appearing to the Cotton Industry Board to affect, or be likely to affect, the industry."</p></blockquote>
What does that mean? I should be glad if the right hon. Gentleman would be good enough to answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for East Ham, South (Mr. Barnes) raised one or two questions concerning the amount of money that might be raised. I have one or two figures here which will, I think, go the whole way to reassure him. In Schedule 5 the total figure for contributions, which rises to £60,000 in 1940 and a possible total of £150,000 in 1943, represents in 1940 .1 per cent. of the total net output of the industry as estimated from figures in the 1935 census of production, and .3 per cent. in 1943 and subsequent years. I think that meets the whole of his fears. He made further reference to the Fifth Schedule, and asked why these figures were going up. He realises that, of course, these are only permissive maxima in advance of the work that will be done by the Board and other bodies, and we anticipate that that work will be developing. They will not attain anything like the full volume of work in the first 12 months, and it has been necessary to put provision in this Bill for a series of stages in which that work may be developed. These are only permissive maxima. The hon. Member will remember that in an earlier stage of the Bill the representatives of the Advisory Council, a widely representative body, will have the opportunity of going through these estimates and making representations in regard to them.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 705</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Elland (Mr. Levy) claimed that there would be no expert knowledge of rayon fabrics on the Cotton Industry Board, but I think it is extremely likely—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Levy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that my hon. Friend has misunderstood me. What I asked was this: You are dealing with the products of the industry and you are going to set up a research department, and since you have now included pure rayon in the industry, because it can be woven on looms, I want to know if that is included in that research?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The research work here is, of course, concerned only with the industry in so far as it is commonly called the cotton industry, and in so far as that is concerned with rayon it is covered by the provisions of this Clause. It does not, of course, affect the work of the rayon producer. As to the knowledge of the Cotton Industry Board of these matters, my hon. Friend does realise that the spinners of rayon staple fibre, the rayon manufacturers and finishers are all paying contributions to these schemes and that it rests with them—we have already discussed this—to see that they are satisfied and are getting proper value. It would be as well to add also that in all this work it will obviously be necessary for the Cotton Industry Board to work in close co-operation with the Export Development Committee. My right hon. Friend stated that he was willing to consider strengthening that Committee from the rayon point of view, so that we should have the benefit of additional advice with regard to foreign markets, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Levy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to delay the proceedings, but that statement is not very helpful. Here you are imposing a levy upon the rayon industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On part of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Levy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Part of that money goes into this particular scheme, and it is only fair that we should get our money's worth. Up to now, my hon. Friend has not said anything to assure me that we are going to get our money's worth. My hon. Friend said that what was going to happen here did not in any sense prevent rayon producers carrying on their own research department with their own money. We all know that, but since you are going to impose a compulsory levy upon them—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 706</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not on the rayon producers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Levy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the industry. On the weavers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You do not speak for them and you must not pretend to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Levy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I speak for the industry as such, and that interruption was quite unnecessary. The rayon industry, including the weavers, are called upon to pay a levy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of my interruption was to make clear beyond the possibility of any further misunderstanding, what the position is. The hon. Member has, I understand, spoken here repeatedly for the rayon producers. They are not going to pay. When that fact is pointed out to him, he says that he is speaking for the industry as a whole, that that includes the weavers and that the weavers are to pay. May I remind him, however, that the weavers are perfectly satisfied?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Levy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I speak in this Committee for my constituency, which represents not only the producers but all the other sections of the industry, and it is not fair to say that I, as representing that industry, am neglecting the rights of a section of the industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say you were.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Levy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was the innuendo, and I resent it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has no right to say that he resents something which I did not say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think the matter is one of great difficulty. On the one hand, as has been made abundantly clear, the rayon producers are wholly unaffected by this Clause. They make another contribution for research done on their behalf. We then come to the rest of the rayon people, that is, the spinners of fibre, the manufacturers and the finishers. They have precisely the same opportunities and the same advantages in this respect as the cotton industry, and as the Committee know from previous Debates, they are fully satisfied with that position.<br><br>
My hon. Friend asked me to refer to one other point. He wishes to know what
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0352">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 707</span>
paragraph (<i>e</i>) means. I think that is merely a statement of an obvious fact. If there is a purely voluntary organisation of the trade, without any statutory powers at all, that head committee, or whatever it may be, which is put in a leading position in the industry, normally represents that industry in any negotiations, whether they are with my right hon. Friend's Department or otherwise. Clearly, that would be the position of the Cotton Industry Board whether we have these words in the Clause or not, but it is a reasonable matter of form that we should simply
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 708</span>
state the fact in the Clause, and that, it seems to me, is all that these words do.</span></p>
<p>Question, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill," put, and agreed to.</p>
<p>Ordered, "That further consideration of the Bill be now adjourned."—[<i>Mr. Stanley.</i>]</p>
<p>Bill to be further considered on Tuesday next.</p>
<p>Committee adjourned at Fifteen minutes after Six o'Clock until Tuesday, 13th June, at Eleven o'Clock.</p>
