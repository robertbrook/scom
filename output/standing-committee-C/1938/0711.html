CLAUSE 1.</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
—(Removal of limitation, and repeals.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p>Motion made, and Question proposed, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill."</p>
<p>11.6 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Bill, as can be seen by hon. Members, is non-controversial which is an unusual thing as far as the mining industry is concerned, but in view of the fact that we had but a very short Debate on the Second Reading, although no Amendments are being moved at this stage we feel that an opportunity should be given to the Secretary for Mines to make a statement upon the intentions of the Mines Department concerning the matters which are affected by this proposal. The purpose of the Bill is to remove the limit of £250,000 per annum at present imposed on the expenditure of the Mines Department. My colleagues on this side of the Committee and I feel that this is a very wise move. As a matter of fact, when the original Act was passed in 1920, the wisdom of limiting the expenditure of the Mines Department was questioned. The Financial Memorandum explains the purpose of the Bill, namely the removal of the limitation imposed in Section 5 of the Mining Industry Act, 1920, and we would like to ask the Secretary for Mines to state here, what are the intentions of his Department, not only in connection with the main recommendations of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 826</span>
Royal Commission, as far as increases in the inspectorate and personnel are concerned, but also in regard to certain other matters.<br><br>
We know that the hon. Gentleman has already announced certain changes in the technical inspectorate which we welcome. The Financial Memorandum suggests that these recommendations are likely to cost something like £70,000 per annum if and when the full recommendations are brought into operation. We would like to know from the hon. Gentleman whether it is intended to expedite the carrying out of these recommendations as much as possible. It may take a year or it may take two years to do so, but we are very anxious that these recommendations should be brought into operation at the earliest possible moment, irrespective of the cost. Everyone will agree that the accident rate in the mining industry is still much too high, and in addition to the accident rate there is a progressive increase in the incidence of industrial diseases and particularly of silicosis. We are not satisfied that all the research which is necessary to bring about the prevention or reduction of this disease is being carried out at present. We, therefore, urge that the research part of the recommendations of the Royal Commission should also come into operation as speedily as possible.<br><br>
One or two points were raised on the Second Reading in connection with the statistical side of the Department's work. Those of us who have to seek information from time to time concerning not only the organisation but other matters connected with the mining industry of this country and the mining industries of other countries as well, are not satisfied that the statistical side of the Mines Department's work is all that it might be. I myself mentioned in the course of the Second Reading Debate the fact that, for certain information we have to go to the statistical departments of other countries. That is a point which ought to be considered in relation to the expenditure which according to the Financial Memorandum is bound to be incurred in connection with these questions.<br><br>
In regard to statistics and research particularly, we would like to know the intention of the Department in its relation to the Safety in Mines Research Board.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0412">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 827</span>
At present the whole or the major part of the money is being found by the Miners' Welfare Fund. Is it the intention of the Mines Department to supplement the income of the Safety in Mines Research Board, or is it the intention of the Department itself to undertake a certain amount of research in addition to that which is carried out by the Safety in Mines Research Board. The question of wastage and overlapping can be gone into at some other time, but this is a question of the position of the Department itself.<br><br>
Some of us have urged for some time that there should be an extension of the activities of the Department itself. This may be a controversial point as far as some hon. Members are concerned, but we feel that the time has arrived when the Mines Department ought to be something more than a Department dealing only with coalmines. We cannot understand why gas and electricity for instance should be left under the control of the Ministry of Transport. It may be that additional powers will have to be sought by the Mines Department. That, certainly, is a question of very high policy but it is very necessary to bring that matter before the Committee on this occasion, and to bring it before the House from time to time. We, on this side, for our part, would say at once that the Department should be not only a Department of Mines but a Department of Fuel and Power. We would extend its name and extend its activities accordingly. With the purpose of this Bill we are in complete agreement. What we do want to press on the Department is this. As a result of the passing of the Bill, they will have more money at their disposal, than they have had hitherto. Now is the time to give consideration to the various matters which I have mentioned. We will see that from time to time pressure will be brought to bear upon them to spend as much possible of the money which will now be available in the directions which I have indicated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to emphasise the points which my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdare (Mr. G. Hall) has just made and the questions which he has addressed to the Secretary for Mines. I think the hon. Gentleman ought to tell us quite clearly and plainly, if he
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 828</span>
knows sufficient about it, what are to be the activities of the Mines Department which justify this Bill? I believe that this is an unusual type of Bill. I have no knowledge of any other Government Department which is limited in this way in regard to its expenditure. The Secretary for Mines will doubtless tell us whether there are any other Departments which are like the Mines Department in this respect, but I do not know of any. I can remember a day when the Department was even threatened with the Geddes axe and when it was suggested that it should be abolished but it has continued to exist since then and I think the general demand to-day is that its activities should be extended to the full extent indicated by my hon. Friend this morning. Further, I do not think that the Miners' Welfare Fund should be called upon to find the money necessary to pay the cost of the work of the Safety in Mines Research Board. I think the Department ought to be responsible for that and that the money which is provided for miners' welfare should be used for miners' welfare generally, in the mining districts and not diverted to other purposes.<br><br>
Again I would like to know whether what is proposed in this Bill is the complete repeal of this statutory limit of £250,000" on an expenditure of Mines Department; whether the expenditure of the Department hereafter can be extended to any amount as rapidly as may be required, and whether the Department will now be able to do what we all desire them to do in every direction. Moreover, it would be interesting to know how many times has this limit of £250,000 been exceeded in the period during which it has been the law of the land. Many of us know that often when we are dealing with Supplementary Estimates, the money has actually been spent before we have voted it in the House of Commons, and I wonder whether the same kind of thing has happened in connection with this Bill. Personally I support my hon. Friend in his view that more work should be done by the Department. I agree with him that it ought to widen its activities very considerably. I think that the mining industry of this country should have a Cabinet Minister of its own; that it should be separated altogether from the Board of Trade, that it should be a Department by itself having control,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0413">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 829</span>
not only over the mines of this country, but also over the other matters suggested by my hon. Friend—that it should be, in short, a Coal and Power Department. However, I suppose we cannot deal with this wider issue this morning, or decide upon the particular points which have been mentioned, but I think that on this occasion we ought to make it clear that we wish for an extension of the work of the Department and that we hope before long to see a Department which will deal with all the factors connected with the important subject of coal and power in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is one point on which I would like to obtain an expression of the views of the Secretary for Mines in connection with this Bill, but before dealing with that I would like to make this comment. In discussing this short Bill which will allow more money for salaries and remuneration in the Mines Department, I could wish that we had a similar short Bill which would provide more money for the remuneration of the mine-workers. That is, I recognise, outside the purview of our discussion this morning, and I content myself with making that passing comment. The hon. Member for Aberdare (Mr. G. Hall) drew attention to the statement that was made by the Secretary for Mines in the House the other day, in answer to a question, about the increased inspectorate. I would like to ask him in view of the extended activities and the additional operations of the Department that are foreshadowed in this Clause, what his attitude is towards workmen's inspectors. Workmen's inspectors play a very important part in connection with the safety arrangements in mines. In certain districts there are regular workmen's inspections. In other districts, I believe, they are not carried out regularly. I know that in my own district there are regular monthly inspections by workmen's inspectors of the principal pits, and the Government inspector in Edinburgh has himself testified to the value of those inspections. I would like to know whether the Department have in mind any effective development of this system of workmen's inspections.<br><br>
I would like the hon. Gentleman to understand that these workmen's inspectors are democratically elected and it is very important that this democratic method of election should remain and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 830</span>
that the workmen inspectors should always be at the disposal of and under the control of the men in the pit. At the same time, I would like to know from him whether the Department has given any consideration to the possibility of providing some of the finance to meet the cost of these workmen's inspections without in any way interfering with the present democratic method of election and control of the inspectors. As most people who know anything about the mining districts realise, these monthly workmen's inspections are of the greatest value from the point of view of safety. They help to make certain that any flaw which occurs about a pit can be immediately tackled and remedied, but it is not enough to leave it to the trade union movement itself to finance these inspections or, as is the case in some places, to leave it to the miners themselves by means of collections to finance these inspections.<br><br>
These inspections should be carried out regularly and the inspectors should be elected by and controlled by the miners in the pit, but the Department should take up consideration of the question of whether it would not be possible for the State, through the Department, to advance some of the necessary finance to maintain this system. I believe that if this question of workmen's inspections, along with the proposal about additional Government inspection and the various other points raised by the hon. Member for Aberdare, and the hon. Member for Rothwell (Mr. Lumn) are taken up as a result of the extension of the work of the Department which will now be possible, that this small Bill may prove to be of considerable value.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I join with the previous speakers in welcoming this Bill which is undoubtedly a step in the right direction. Though it does not go very far, it does remove the limit of £250,000 which has hitherto been placed on the expenditure of the Department. The figure mentioned of anticipated increased expenditure, in connection with what is now being done in regard to the extension of the system of inspections, is, approximately, £70,000 per annum. The words of the Financial Memorandum are: —
<br><blockquote><p>"a considerable increase in the duties and personnel of the Department and in particular of the mines Inspectorate."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0414">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 831</span>
Then the Financial Memorandum, having indicated the figure of £70,000 per annum, goes on to say: —
<br><blockquote><p>"This figure which is not likely to be reached in the next year or two does not include anything in respect of the recommendations of the Commission with respect to the organisation and control of mining research and the expansion of testing services."</p></blockquote>
Apparently, then, this figure of £70,000 per annum which is expected to be reached in a couple of years time will be expended entirely on the increase of the staff in the Department here in London, and the increase in the number of inspectors throughout the country. I would like to know whether the Secretary for Mines can tell us what will be the increased expenditure on staff in London and what will be the increased expenditure on the inspectorate throughout the country. It would be interesting to know how the sum is divided between those two heads. I agree with the last speaker in reference to the importance of the workmen's inspections under Section 16 of the 1911 Act. What he said is perfectly true. There are some collieries where it is possible to carry out these workmen's inspections with regularity. They are, in the main, collieries where large numbers of men are employed, and the men are able by means of collections among themselves to pay for the cost of making these inspections regularly. But in the case of the great majority of the small collieries in the country advantage cannot be taken of the provisions of Section 16 of the 1911 Act, because the finance is not available, and this means that they lose the very valuable benefit of miners' inspections because of the fact that they are not able to pay for them.<br><br>
I think everybody who knows anything about the mines will agree that the present incidence of accidents is far too high. We are now to have an increase in the number of inspectors. I hope that when the full recommendations of the Commission are put into operation, very important changes will be made in the duties of these inspectors. I have always taken the view, and I do not think I have got much support from the Department in it, that it would be to the advantage of all concerned if His Majesty's Inspectors reported fully on every inspection which they make, in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 832</span>
the case of every mine. I would like to see the report published at the pithead. Under Section 16 of the Act of 1911 the miners can appoint a couple of their number to make an examination. Their report is written out fully before they leave the colliery; a copy of it is posted at the pithead, a copy is sent to the Divisional Inspector, and I take it that another copy finds its way to the Department here in London. But nothing of the kind happens as far as the reports of the Government inspectors are concerned. The Government inspectors can and do go into the collieries and they may come to conclusions about certain parts of certain collieries which they believe to be unsafe, but those conclusions may never be mentioned to the workmen themselves—the people who are most important in this connection.<br><br>
I remember an experience of my own when I was a miners' agent in Monmouthshire. An inspection took place on a certain day of a certain colliery and the mines inspector afterwards made recommendations to the mine manager, but he made no recommendation to the mine workers. Two years after those recommendations had been made an explosion occurred in that colliery, and about 20 lives were lost. It was then discovered that these recommendations had been made by the mines inspector two years before and that no notice had been taken of them by the mine manager, and as a result of the neglect of the recommendations the explosion occurred. That is one example to show how advantageous it would be if the mines inspectors were to report fully upon every inspection which they make. I think it would be a great advantage from the point of view of safety if more publicity could be given to what the inspectors think about the conditions in particular mines. The mine-workers are the most important people concerned and they certainly ought to know what the mines inspector, who is, after all, considered to be an expert, thinks about the conditions in the mine. That has not been provided for up to the present and I take it that we cannot do anything about it in this Bill, but I hope that the Secretary for Mines when he is considering more fully the recommendations of the Royal Commission will bear it in mind. The hon. Gentleman in answer to a Supplementary Question in the House the other day said that a Bill
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0415">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 833</span>
was now in the course of preparation to deal with these questions. I hope that in connection with the drafting of the Bill a note will be taken of the point I have just raised. I welcome the Bill. I think it is, as I have said, a step in the right direction, and I hope that it will be put into operation at once and that the increased inspection will come into force at the earliest possible date.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bracken</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to break up the happy harmony of this Committee, but I am rather disappointed at the Financial Memorandum which has been presented to us in connection with this little Bill. It has not, I think, been written by the Secretary for Mines. Indeed, it seems to have been written by one of the bleakest minds in the Treasury. Referring to the very important question of research this statement is made.
<br><blockquote><p>"It has not yet been found possible to give sufficient consideration to these recommendations to allow of even a rough estimate of the possible cost."</p></blockquote>
Mining research is perhaps one of the most important duties that could be conferred upon a Ministry, and if the suggestions made by hon. Gentlemen opposite are taken into account, and if the Ministry is given more money and if its powers are broadened, then I should have thought that the first duty of the Minister in charge of the Department would be to extend mining research. After all in the past coal has been the basis of this country's wealth. We have risen to greatness on coal and I believe that coal will again be one of the greatest industries in this country when it ceases to be used waste-fully for consumption purposes and is treated as a great capital asset. Therefore I appeal to my hon. Friend the Secretary for Mines to give attention to research. I know that he is one of the busiest of the new brooms in the Government. We know his record in another Department, and we are satisfied that he should be given sufficient money to enable the Mines Department to set up a proper research branch.<br><br>
It is really incredible that at a time like the present when we want to develop every asset we have in this country that this great question of mining research should be completely neglected. Some of the bigger companies like Imperial Chemicals and the mining companies themselves are spending a certain amount
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 834</span>
of money in research. But that expenditure is not co-ordinated. The Minister of Mines should set up a proper research department, thoroughly manned, and proceed to consider the best methods of exploiting the mineral wealth of this country. As no opportunity ever occurs to raise this matter in the House, I am glad to be able to do it in Committee. I hope that hon. Members opposite will encourage the Minister in regard to research, and that he will be backed up by us all in his applications to the Treasury. When the Treasury hear the word "research," they want to kill it straight away. They will give money to Poles, Rumanians and Turks; they will give it for every sort of agricultural activity; but the very mention of research makes Sir Horace Wilson's blood run cold. I hope that the Minister will get plenty of money, and use it for research.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. E. J. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members on this side welcome the splendid speech that we have just heard from the hon. Member for North Paddington (Mr. Bracken). He has phrased it very nicely. We shall never be able to make great headway in the mining industry until we have an adequate sum available for research. The Minister will know that there are tremendous developments taking place in Germany, where they are concerned not only to use science for the benefit of specific private purposes, but to get from the scientists the best ideas that can be applied to a given problem. I had occasion three weeks ago to speak to one of our famous scientists in South Wales about hydro-genation and other synthetic treatments of coal; and he said he was amazed at the headway made in Germany and other countries, where the scientists are concerned to develop national assets, and not the specific interests of private firms. In the mining industry, if we are to keep pace with the times, scientific men must have the opportunity of applying those ideas to whatever problems arise in the industry. It cannot be done with the amount of money available. The safety of the miner and the progressive development of the industry depend substantially on the work of scientists—not forgetting, of course, the enormous service rendered by manual labour in the industry. I trust that quite a new approach will be made to the problem. The Minister himself is very energetic. We read and hear of his descending certain
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0416">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 835</span>
shafts and going through seams which are 1 ft. 9 in. or 2 ft. deep.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary for Mines (Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Two feet three inches.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He does this, I presume, in order that he may understand, when the Commission's report is presented to the House, what the practical miner has to contend with. Some of us have worked for years in seams of that thickness. We realise that the first essential in the mines is fresh air. We believe that explosions in the mines could be abolished if there were fresh circuits of ventilation. If the gobs were properly stowed, there would be no accumulations of gas, and, therefore, no explosions. We should like to see the Minister's Department concentrate on problems of that kind. I am particularly concerned about the question of greater facilities for workmen's inspections, especially in small mines. As a miner's agent for some years, I have been in the fortunate position of having under my purview two permanent examiners. The fact that they were known to be available to visit a mine at any time, day or night, has, I am quite sure, improved the standard of safety enormously. The manager was aware that they could always come back at any time, and make sure that a job had been done. I could give figures to show how accidents have decreased as a result.<br><br>
In the small mines, where the men themselves apply Section 16 of the Act and inspect the mines once monthly, they have to contribute weekly to a levy, and the fund available would not be sufficient to maintain permanent inspectors. For men to carry out the inspections when they have their own jobs to do in the mines leads to all sorts of difficulties. It is not uncommon for men to face victimisation— and victimisation which could hardly be substantiated in the sense that they had suffered a definite reduction in their wages, but which could be shown by examination of their wage sheets over a long period and the sort of places where they were put to work. They have been sent to what we call abnormal places, where, under the piece-work system, they were unable to earn a reasonable wage. So a greater inspectorate is essential. At the same time, the Department should
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 836</span>
encourage workmen's inspectors, by endeavouring to provide the greatest possible facilities, particularly in the small mines referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypool (Mr. A. Jenkins).<br><br>
The great difficulty in mining to-day is the application of machine mining, and the new conveyor system. There can be no doubt that they are creating difficulties such as the mining industry was never confronted with before. The necessity arises for inspectors who are properly acquainted with the new mechanisation. I know that the Minister cannot reply to all these points which have been raised, but I hope he will consider them. I am dissatisfied with what is being done under the Bill. In fact, I doubt if we on this side shall ever be satisfied until mining is placed in the same position as agriculture, so that we have a Cabinet Minister to look after the lives of the men in the industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. R. J. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I endorse everything that has been said from this side. I welcome the Bill, because it makes financial provision for an extension of the Department's work. I am pleased that more is to be spent on research, and that there are to be more inspectors. I know that our local inspectors do invaluable work, but I would rather that they were kept more for the day-to-day working of the mines, rather than having to find out technical faults. A large number of cases against one colliery company have recently been brought before the courts, and fines totalling about £95 were imposed. In those cases, the local inspector made the report, and some time afterwards the Government took action. Surely it should not be necessary to have so many cases concerning one colliery coming up together. I know the magistrates personally, and I am sure they would do their duty, but it is an embarrassing position for them to have so many cases against one company. There are so many considerations that might come into their minds—the manager may not be very well off, or the company may be mulcted in such fines that they may not be able to carry on. The cases should be dealt with as each one arises.<br><br>
In the northern districts the number of accidents to boys has been alarming. The majority of them occur on the roadways. Some time ago we had a case—not an uncommon one—which was due to a boy's head being caught between a wagon
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0417">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 837</span>
and a girder. It ought to be impossible for that to happen. Recently, however, a fatal accident occurred to a boy in charge of a pony. It is thought that the pony stopped because there was a stone on the roadway, and that the boy reached over to remove the stone, with the result that his head was caught between a prop and the tub. That prop must have been there for some time, because it was on the wagon way. I want more inspectors, so that they will have these roof supports which are near to the moving tubs removed. I want more inspectors, and more authority given to them, so that they will be able to have these things remedied, and the number of accidents reduced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Alan Graham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Minister one question in regard to research. How far is there constant co-ordination between the Ministry and the Fuel Research Department? When I was at the Privy Council Department there seemed to be very little co-ordination between those two bodies. It seems to me, however, that any hope of progress in research is unlikely unless there is constant co-ordination between these two bodies, which are engaged in finding out the same things.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sexton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not a miner. I sometimes envy my colleagues their experiences, but to-day, hearing of the sad results of mining, I do not. It is appalling that at this stage of civilisation boys of 14 and 15 should lose their lives because of conditions in the mines. Research, to me, seems to fall mainly into two parts— the first, that which affects the safety of the individual from physical troubles like nystagmus and silicosis, while the second is concerned with the scientific development of coal. This country is in a very primitive condition in regard to the working of coal. The industry seems to be a sort of cannibal society. It is concerned only with raw coal, and it thinks that the devouring of raw coal is all that is required. There should be research so that the men who deal with raw coal should have the advantage of further development. We have in the north of England and in South Wales areas which were once mining areas and are now Special Areas. I am of the opinion that they are Special Areas because we have remained in that cannibal system of society, and have dealt with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 838</span>
raw coal rather than going on with the development of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for North Paddington (Mr. Bracken) has given evidence of the interest which London Members take in this subject. There are one or two points arising out of questions asked by hon. Members opposite that I should like to raise, but the Committee is waiting to hear the Minister, and I shall ask only one question. If we help the Minister this morning to get the purse strings of the Treasury unloosed, will he do all he can to accelerate the production of the annual reports of his Department? In the last few years the annual report has appeared between August and October. Here we are, on nth July, discussing the mining industry and the latest comprehensive statistics we have about that industry carry us only up to 31st December, 1937. I am one of those —and there are many others—who have no personal interest in the mining industry, but are intensely interested in the welfare of those engaged in it. We should do all in our power to help the Minister to better the state of the industry, and the happiness of all concerned in it. I know that the whole Committee agrees that the Minister has made a wonderful start. All of us who are not directly or locally concerned with the industry would be greatly helped in keeping ourselves apprised of trends if we could have the report rather earlier. Although I should be the last to suggest that the hard-worked officials of the Department should be taken this year from their urgent duty of preparing the new safety Bill, I hope that when that Bill and the consequential work arising out of it are out of the way, the Minister will do all in his power to let us have this report regularly earlier in the year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Roth-well (Mr. Lunn) said that this is an unusual Bill. It is an unusual Bill, the reason being that it is designed to remove a limitation which is not only unusual, but unique. No other Department has ever had a statutory limitation on expenditure placed on it by Parliament. The expenditure of the Department has been for some years approximating to the statutory limitation. I can assure hon-Members that we have not exceeded it. We should not like to be guilty of an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0418">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 839</span>
impropriety—if not an illegality—of that character, which would land us in trouble not only with the Treasury, but with the House of Commons. It was obvious that the first step towards a big effort to implement the report of the Royal Commission was to get a Bill to remove this statutory limitation. This is, of course, a Bill to remove the limitation, and not an, Estimate. We shall have to get Parliamentary approval, in the ordinary way, for the details of expenditure as they arise.<br><br>
I might say a word about the question of statistics. In general, I will admit, I have some sympathy with the point of view that has been expressed, having studied from time to time the system of Government statistics in America, and in Canada, where the system approximates to the same standard of efficiency, and I have been very much impressed with its value. On the other hand, one has to remember it is based on a pretty lavish expenditure upon staff, and I think probably the right policy is to try to achieve a just compromise—reaching as high a standard as you can, without too lavish an expenditure upon the clerical side. I will promise to consider the question of whether we cannot advance the date of the annual report. I remember having certain difficulties in this matter in connection with the Factories Report in the Home Office which is a rather similar problem. There are great difficulties involved. I will do what I can but in view of the difficulties I do not want to give too binding an undertaking, in the absence of complete investigation. I have made a beginning, which I think is a step in the right direction, by instituting weekly statements of accidents in mines. I did so for the purpose of providing the industry with up-to-date figures of accidents, in the belief that while the figures are fresh and relate to a recent period, they will be of much greater interest both to the workers and to the technicians of the industry.<br><br>
Now I come to the question of research which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Aberdare (Mr. G. Hall) and also in a most helpful constructive speech by my hon. Friend the Member for North Paddington (Mr. Bracken). I particularly welcomed his speech because I know that he is never afraid to do battle with the Treasury. Indeed he can be seen in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 840</span>
action on the Floor of the House of Commons from time to time and therefore he is a most valuable ally in this matter. I would like to say first that, of course, the question of research in the mining industry is divided broadly into two aspects. There is what may be called broadly, safety research, and there is what may be called industrial, economic and technical research. There is no doubt about the fact that these have certain connections. On the other hand, they are distinct as well. With regard to technical research a great deal of work is at present being done by the Fuel Research Board. I will give my hon. Friend this undertaking—that I will take a very special interest in that matter also, in connection with the interest which I already take in safety research and in relation to the whole problem of research in the industry.<br><br>
I come next to the actual position of safety research as it has been left by the Royal Commission's Report. They recommended that the control of research which is at present in the hands of the Safety in Mines Research Board and also th? Miners' Welfare Committee, should at some date in the future come under the direct control of the Secretary for Mines. They laid stress upon a point which interests me a great deal and which I think important. They laid stress on the importance of testing out the .results of research under practical working conditions. As a matter of fact, they did not appear to attach very great urgency to the problem of dealing with the organisation of research—not I think because they under-estimated its importance but merely because they thought that things such as the reorganisation of the inspectorate and various other provisions which they recommended, were even more urgent.<br><br>
What they actually recommended was that this reorganisation should be undertaken "when a suitable opportunity presents itself." Of course, it would be important to discuss this matter with the Miners' Welfare Committee and with the Safety in Mines Research Board; I intend to do this, but I think the Committee will realise that it is not easy for me to give even a rough estimate of the cost of the new arrangements, until I have discussed it with those two bodies.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0419">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 841</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is this limitation of £250,000 on the expenditure of the Mines Department the reason why the Miners' Welfare Fund has had to provide for safety research?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No I think one could say that the reasons were broader than that, even though that may have had, in the past, some connection with it. What I would say in regard to this question is that I will endeavour to arrange that "a suitable opportunity" shall "present itself"—in the words of the Royal Commission—sooner rather than later, although I think the Committee will realise that the pressure of other work upon the staff of the Department is very great indeed. On the general question of the organisation of the health and safety departments and of the inspectorate, I should like to say that we are really engaged in a genuine endeavour to make a fresh start and if possible big progress in connection with the safety problem in mines, following the report of the Royal Commission. The Royal Commission themselves said that their report involved giving the industry an opportunity of making a new start. They said that their plan was a constructive inter-dependent plan, requiring the wholehearted co-operation of all sections of the industry.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Aberdare asked whether we would expedite the work as much as possible. I would like to make the point that my announcement in the House last week on the re-organisation of the health and safety division of the Mines Department, and the re-organisation of the inspectorate was a strategic measure for quickening progress under the Royal Commission's Report because it is designed to get the executive organisation of the Department all ready for carrying out such provisions as may be decided upon by Parliament in the new Safety in Mines Bill, when the House comes to deal with it. The Committee will appreciate the fact that if you pass a Bill and you have not the executive machinery ready to administer it, you are bound to have a certain measure of delay. It is definitely a factor of speed to get the executive organisation ready before you have the actual Bill and that is the object of bringing forward re-organisation at this stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do I gather that there is to be any delay at all in the appointment
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 842</span>
of these additional inspectors? Their main duty, I judge from what the hon. Gentleman has just said, will be to act as a kind of executive to carry out the recommendations which will be embodied in the new Bill—the recommendations of the Commission. I gathered from the hon. Gentleman's statement last week, that these additional inspectors would be appointed as early as possible and would at once start to carry out the highly important work of inspection in the mines.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to the very point which the hon. Member has raised in regard to that, both at headquarters and in the mines. I would tell him that about £10,000 is the figure which deals with headquarters re-organisation. He asked for that figure. With regard to these appointments our desire is to make them as quickly as possible. Some of the head quarters appointments have already been made, and we are proceeding with the others as quickly as we can, although hon. Members here who are interested in and have knowledge of the mining industry know that it is not altogether easy to get the high type of men required for some of these appointments. The hon. Member for Ogmore (Mr. E. J. Williams) when he spoke about the immense new technical problems of the industry, arising from machine-mining, electrification and so on, and the necessity for new mines, was underlining that difficulty. We want to make these appointments as quickly as possible but we want to get the right men for them.<br><br>
That brings me to the very important question of workmen's inspectors raised by the hon. Member for West Fife (Mr. Gallacher) and also mentioned by the hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Jenkins) and the hon. Member for Ogmore. The Royal Commission attached the greatest importance to the development of the system of workmen's inspections, and I venture to add from my own limited experience and from some general knowledge of the problem, that I also attach the highest importance to the development of this system. I was particularly interested when I was in Northumberland with the hon. Member for Morpeth (Mr. R. J. Taylor) to see a district where workmen's inspections have been developed to a high point and where they have had whole-time inspectors, on an established basis, for some years
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0420">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 843</span>
with valuable results. We have followed up this recommendation of the Royal Commission, I think I can say, with speed, and I think I can also say satisfactorily. We referred it to the Joint Consultative Committee and I am glad to say that after they had conferred upon it they reached agreement in principle upon a scheme to establish workmen's inspections and upon the provision of compulsory regular quarterly inspections in addition to the monthly voluntary inspections mentioned by the hon. Member for West Fife. Of course a part of that scheme is that there should be permanent whole-time workmen's inspectors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman get any reports from the workmen's inspectors in Fife.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not myself so far had reports from the workmen's inspectors in Fife but I could arrange to get them and I will look into that matter if the hon. Member would like me to do so. I would also mention that the employers have agreed, as the Royal Commission recommended, to pay one-half of the cost of these workmen's inspections. The Committee will agree that that is not unsatisfactory—in fact, satisfactory—progress, and I think we ought to give the employers' organisations our approval and our appreciation of the fact that they have been able, so completely, to reach agreement with the workmen's representatives on this very important recommendation of the Royal Commission. I would say to the hon. Member for Morpeth that one of the important features of the development of workmen's inspections is the increased co-operation which we hope to get between the workmen's inspectors and His Majesty's inspectors in carrying out the safety inspection of mines. I do not think the Committee would wish me to go into a long discussion of the question of the publication of all the reports of His Majesty's inspectors—a question which was raised by the hon. Member for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 844</span>
Pontypool. There is a good deal to be said on both sides, and I wonder whether a great deal of practical progress could not be made by making it a regular practice for His Majesty's inspectors to be accompanied by workmen's inspectors particularly when there will be many more of them once these proposals come to fruition. A great deal could be done by informal practical discussion between them, instead of merely posting stereotyped reports at the pitheads. I have tried to answer as many points as I could without unduly wearying the Committee and I hope we may now get the Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. R. J. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that attention will be given to the point which I have made in regard to roadways—that there should be sufficient clearance, both in height and width. I appreciate the fact that the Minister is entering into his job in the right spirit. I had the opportunity of being with him on one of his tours. I know his desire to see the worst of it, and as far as I,could, I endeavoured to give him full satisfaction in that respect. Unless something is done and unless more power is given to deal with circumstances such as those I have spoken of, we must continue to have a high accident rate among our boys.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That point certainly will not be overlooked and I would remind the hon. Member that the Royal Commission recommended that there should be legislation to give inspectors more power to require greater height and width in roadways.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. E. J. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The best way is to keep the boys on the surface.</span></p>
<p>Question "That the Clause stand part of the Bill," put, and agreed to.</p>
