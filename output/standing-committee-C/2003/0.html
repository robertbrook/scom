	<ol>
	<li>the carer, or</li>
	<li>a person with parental responsibility for a disabled child ("the responsible person").</li></ol>
	<li>The local authority must inform the carer or, as appropriate, the responsible person that he may be entitled to a carer's assessment (but this is subject to subsections (3) and (4)).</li>
	<li>Subsection (2) does not apply in relation to the carer if the local authority has previously—</li>
