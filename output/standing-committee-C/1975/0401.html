	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>AGRICULTURE (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILL</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Fred Peart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That during the further proceedings on the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock."</p></blockquote>
We are not suggesting that any individual Members or groups of Members have sought to filibuster in anyway. I have carefully read all the Committee Reports. I have read them even when I have not attended the proceedings. I think that the arguments on succession have been reasonable and constructive. I pay tribute to the Committee for the reasonable attitude that it has adopted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, this is the 22nd sitting and many more clauses and amendments remain to be considered. We debated the principle of succession on the Floor of the House. If the Opposition think that detailed discussion is still necessary, we shall have to have longer sittings. That will enable hon. Members to deploy their case fully, as they have previously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to the Minister for coming to the Committee to move the motion himself. I was glad to hear him acknowledge that throughout our deliberations there has been no filibustering. I am sure that that is true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A feature of the Bill is that the earlier clauses tended to deal one clause at a time with different and important factors—for example, the Sugar Board and the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation. We had to deal with the fundamentals of each individual topic. The debates were wider than they would have been if, for instance, the first eight clauses had dealt with only one matter. I am disappointed that the Government are moving this motion. However, I am glad to hear that they are not trying to curtail the amount of time that we shall spend debating the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1030</span>
important original seven clauses dealing with the succession of tenancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister understands that those fundamental clauses have spawned a number of other new clauses on associated matters. A new clause has been tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon), and others have been tabled by the hon. Members for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) and Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan). New Clause 18 stands in my name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we took 15 Sittings to deal with the first batch of clauses, I think I am right in saying that so far as we have taken only seven Sittings to deal with the seven new clauses. They relate to much more important and fundamental matters than those arising in the earlier part of the Bill. It is not unnatural that we should want to have rather more than seven Sittings to deal with such fundamentals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge that the Government are not trying to cut our time, but they are trying to hurry us a little. They are trying to bring forward as far as they can the terminal date of our proceedings in Committee. It is a pity that they should do so, because, as I think the right hon. Gentleman will know, I explained through the usual channels that in my view we should finish our deliberations at the end of the first week after the Easter Recess. We are therefore, talking only in terms of one Sitting week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a pity that the Government are seeking to hurry us, as we are still receiving new ideas. In the Minister's Press handout, I observed that his hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary had made a speech somewhere in the Midlands on the matters that we are debating in the seven new clauses. Last night, the Minister and I attended a pleasant and agreeable function. I can tell him that I was approached there by a journalist who had read his hon. Friend's speech with a great deal of interest and was under the impression that he was speaking of a fairly new matter. Let me assure the right hon. Gentleman that I was able to tell the journalist that it was not new. I shall identify the journalist to the Parliamentary Secretary in private later because I think that I probably saved that journalist from some embarrassment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that the message of what is contained in the new clauses has not yet
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0567">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1031</span>
totally filtered through to those who are interested in and associated with agriculture. The journalist who thought that the hon. Gentleman had raised a fairly new matter is a prominent agriculture journalist. I think that the hon. Gentleman will agree that there is not very much that is new in his Department's Press handout.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the fundamental implications that follow from the new clauses are discussed at sufficient length so that all those who might be affected have ample opportunity to think about them. Surely it would not be unreasonable to give the Committee another two weeks, one week being the Easter Recess and the second week being the first week back after the recess. I ask the right hon. Gentleman to consider that. There are many sections throughout the industry which are not yet fully appraised of what is implied by the seven new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the motion is accepted I suppose that the 4.30 p.m. sittings will begin next Tuesday. That is totally unacceptable. I shall be surprised if we do not hear from the right hon. Gentleman's hon. Friends that it is unreasonable to ask us to leave the Chamber in the middle of the Chancellor's Budget Statement to resume our deliberations in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But who knows what will happen between now and then? We shall certainly have a new Prime Minister. I know that over the past few weeks the right hon. Gentleman has been working very hard in putting forward the clause of the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. I recognise the Minister's well-known powers of persuasion and his charm. It appears from the newspapers that his work will be crowned with success. There were some who thought that with a change of Prime Minister there would be a new face in Whitehall Place. Bearing in mind what the right hon. Gentleman is doing and has done to support the claim of the Foreign Secretary, it is probably doubtful that we shall see a new face in Whitehall Place for the time being.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) will recall that in one of the speeches last night at the very agreeable dinner which we attended a number of remarks were made about the Minister going to another place. I feel that that is doubtful in view of the likely outcome of the Labour Party's elections for a new Prime Minister.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1032</span>
I should be surprised if the Minister wanted to be in Committee when he could be in the Chamber to attend the first Budget day for the new Prime Minister, who looks as though he will be the man to whom the Minister has devoted so much time and support over the past few weeks. I hope that Members on both sides of the Committee will agree that it is totallyunacceptable for us to be asked to meet next Tuesday afternoon. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will give us an undertaking straight away that that will not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have asked as many questions as I feel inclined to ask, but I must return to what I said a few moments ago. I hope that the Minister will reconsider. There are many people who are still not sure about the implications of the new clauses. We should have a little more time so that outside interests can make their observations. I have tabled a new clause as a result of what was proposed by the County Landowner's Association. I tabled it only last Tuesday. That shows the extent to which people are still taking up their positions and trying to grapple with the implications of what the Minister has proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the right hon. Gentleman to consider whether it would not be better if we were to meet in thc first week after Easter and to withdraw the motion at this stage. I think that I can give an undertaking that by continuing morning sittings only we shall be able to complete all the discussions that we require by the end of the first week after the Easter Recess.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling). It was well known to us all that discussions were taking place through the usual channels with the objective contained in the motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has said that the Committee has been dealing in effect with two separate Bills. First, there was the Bill which was presented to the House before Christmas and which we despatched in 15 sittings. The Committee was then rightly adjourned at the Government's request.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have spent only five mornings dealing with what is perhaps the greatest single change in the agricultural landlord and tenant holding law for some 30 years. It must be almost unprecedented to put a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0568">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1033</span>
timetable motion on an Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. I am sure that it is unprecedented to do so when a Committee has taken only five sittings to deal with a matter of such major importance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are precedents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I bow to the Minister's superior knowledge of Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bills. This is only the third such Bill that I have had the opportunity of considering in Committee. I know that the Minister has sat on many more than that. In fact, I was looking up earlier 	<i>Hansards</i> only last week. I found that in 1968 the Minister was saying the same things about being absent from Committee because of Cabinet commitments that he said last Tuesday. His comments were almost word for word the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has before it a proposition that it sits at 4.30 in the afternoon on Tuesdays and Thursdays, that arrangement to start on next Tuesday. If we do so, we shall miss a great deal of the Chancellor's statement. I cannot believe that that was the Government's intention. There must have been an oversight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we sit next Tuesday afternoon, those hon. Members who have made detailed plans for the next 10 days or the next fortnight will be grossly inconvenienced. It has long been established that Budget week is taken up with speeches on the Finance Bill. Those who do not have those interests often plan trips and expeditions during Budget week to deal with Parliamentary matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have planned to go to Ulster on behalf of the Conservative Party. The visit has been arranged by the Secretary of State for Defence. If we are to sit in the afternoons, there will be endless difficulties with my Whip. I shall probably have to cancel my visit to Ulster. However, that is not important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should have time to deal with the Bill properly. We have already made a fair offer. I remind Labour Members that the title of the Bill allows us to amend it in any way we like. Tabling amendments dealing with agriculture leaves a wide opportunity open to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland could not give a more substantial commitment. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will recon-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1034</span>
sider his motion. After all, we were talking about sitting for only two mornings after Easter. I understand that there was the further proposal that we should not sit on the Thursday before Easter. We could easily deal with the extremely important matters that we are discussing within a normal timetable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has said that he cannot point a finger to overlong speeches from the Opposition in the debates on the new clauses. There was a long debate on the education qualifications, but I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will acknowledge that we have been discussing a substantial change in Government policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was right that there should have been proper debate on this change, for it will affect the lives of many hundreds of people. We are being forced at gunpoint to sit all night to force this Bill through in order to suit Government business managers who have got into an appalling muddle. That is why the right hon. Gentleman is being pressurised by the Chief Whip, because we know full well that there is legislation stacking up, mostly of an objectionable kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been told to get this Bill out of Committee. The right hon. Gentleman also knows full well that he diddled the Government Chief Whip when asking for time by saying that it was not a controversial matter and then in the middle of the progress on the Bill altering its nature completely and making it highly controversial. I am sure that you will agree, Mr. Costain, that this has been the case and this is why you accepted the motion to adjourn and why we have had only five morning Sittings on what is substantially a new Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support what my hon. Friends have said on this motion. Bearing in mind the Minister's affable speech last night in another place, which has already been mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling), when he gave no indication—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keth Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What was this?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will talk about it later. He gave no indication that he was to move in this unacceptable way. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0569">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1035</span>
Government themselves have created the problems with this Bill. We ourselves would have concluded the Bill as it was presented to the House on Second Reading many Sittings ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To be fair, perhaps my hon. Friend is not aware that the Government side had made us aware before he and I and the Minister attended the function last night that it was their intention to move this motion. It would be wrong for my hon. Friend to feel that it has been jumped on us this morning. I was aware of it last night.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In those circumstances I will withdraw my remarks, but I would say to the Minister that I am surprised that he was then able to be so affable and generous towards my hon. Friend. I enjoyed the right hon. Gentleman's company, but I might not have enjoyed it as much had I known of what we would debate this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Government to think seriously of the predicament in which some hon. Members will find themselves. I refer particularly to those hon. Members who sit on Select Committees. I am a member of the Select Committee on Public Expenditure. We meet regularly during the week to discuss very important matters. If my attendance at those meetings will be restricted by my attendance here, I shall not think that I am undertaking my duties correctly. Bearing in mind the assurance that my hon. Friend has given to the Government, I am sure that they may well reconsider the motion. If they proceed with it, perhaps unofficially we on this side of the Committee can make it uncomfortable for them. Why should we not if we think that they are doing something which we consider to be quite unnecessary following the most reasonable assurance by my hon. Friend?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may well be that some hon. Members opposite—certainly the terrible twins—will relish the tussle of the conflict which would occur late at night in this Committee if we sat in the afternoons and evenings. I am sure that other Government suoporters would not enjoy sitting late at night. We want to sit for about two sittings only after the Easter break. Is that unreasonable? Should the workings of this House be put in difficulties and many hon. Members inconvenienced, per-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1036</span>
haps beyond the activities of this House, by making it difficult for them to attend to their constituency problems? Will not the Government see sense at this stage and withdraw this motion and allow us to sit in the mornings and twice after Easter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) must feel as distraught as I do—all these references to this wonderful function last night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two aspects to this Sittings Motion which the right hon. Gentleman has moved in courteous and reasonable terms. One is domestic affecting the House and hon. Members, and the other affects the public and those who will be caught up in this legislation. Much has been made of the presentation of the Budget. That is a good point which the Minister cannot put on one side. My hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) has referred to his own obligation to a Select Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have this obligation. I am also sitting on a Government Committee. Quite what a Government Committee is eludes definition but the fact is that we are due to meet to consider the deficit on the catering activities in this House. Because the Catering Committee's overdraft is of the order of £1/2million and nobody knows how to solve this problem, we are having a meeting. We have outside members on that Committee—hon. Members are in a minority—and we are due to meet next Tuesday at 5.30 p.m. We are reaching the point of drafting our report and I would find it sad not to be able to participate in that function. I can only feel that if we do sit there, my duties here must override such other duties as I have, including constituency obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wholeheartedly support what my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland said about the outside world. These new clauses have hardly yet begun to seek into the consciousness, let alone the comprehension, of numerous of my constituents. I can vouchsafe that by the correspondence I am having with my county council. In various suggestions they make in relation to smallholders they have not caught up yet with some of the new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a serious point. A little more time to give the recipients of this legislation a chance to consider its purport would have much to be said for it. If at the end of this short exchange the Minister
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0570">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1037</span>
feels unable to make any concession in the Sittings Motion, perhaps he will go so far as to assure the Committee that he will use his best endeavours to secure that the Report stage is pushed on reasonably well. That might allow time for the general public to comprehend the Bill. We need two days for the Report stage of this now complicated and lengthy piece of legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In some ways I have mixed feelings about this motion. In one way I rather welcome this opportunity for the much more detailed and prolonged discussion of these new Clauses which will be possible if we sit through the night. I for one have felt inhibited up to now from speaking at any length or in detail about some of the matters which are extremely important. More than once I have been subjected to some rather disagreeable glances from my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) who says "Oh, he is going on again!" I am under pressure sometimes to make short speeches. My hon. Friends have felt that if I were to prolong the discussions, we should have a Sittings Motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The result has been that most of the things I wished to say have not been said and I feel rather sore about it. If we have a Sittings Motion and we can sit from 4.30 onwards, my inhibitions will go and I shall feel at liberty, or even under an obligation, to say what needs to be said. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells), if I may call him that, will share my sentiments. He has felt rather shut out from so many of our discussions and he has not always been able to attend as a result. He represents a distinctive kind of farmer and very many people who will be much affected by these new clauses. If we are to have full discussions going through the night, he will be able to be here and play his full part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But other parts of England are well represented and we have on this side of the Committee every kind of agricultural representative. Maybe from now on, if the Sittings Motion is passed, every form of agricultural case will be well and truly probed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will appreciate, Mr. Costain, that most of the Amendments had been probing Amendments. It is right that we should probe and probe in detail, because
	<span class='label label-info column'>1038</span>
we are concerned now with a fundamental and radical change in agricultural law. One of my hon. Friends has said that we are discussing two Bills and not one. That is right. These new clauses are very new.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) made the point that some of the features of the new clauses had not sunk in yet. Of course the leaders of the NFU, those who give legal advice to the NFU, the CLA and the RICS, for example, have had an opportunity of discussing these subjects, but they have not been discussed at ground level in the farming industry, and that is extremely serious. We shall have a bit of a backlash in the summer if we do not discuss these matters fully and carefully now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tragedy is that if we do sit through the night that will not facilitate our being able to consult our constituents in the detail necessary. I have sought to do so, but I have failed to get in touch adequately with all those I represent. t may be that I have a large number of farmers—4,800 members in the Holland county branch. Even the NFU has not been able to consult all the affected interests. If we are to be hustled into reaching decisions without the rank and file of industry being allowed to express its point of view, some of these clauses, unpopular as they are, will be even more unpopular.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend acknowledge that it is not just the ordinary people? I have here a letter from the Chairman of the Agricultural Law Asociation.—I have mentioned it many times—lawyers who make their living out of agricultural law but who were able to have their first meeting on the new clauses only last night. The point he is making is very important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only last night? I am grateful for that intervention. It illustrates how the experts themselves, who are primarily concerned, have had woefully little opportuneity of probing the extent of the new clauses and how they will change ourindustry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If they were able to debate it among themselves only as late as last night, they obviously have had little oportunity to discuss it with their clients and other people likely to be affected. I do not propose to say any more now. I shall save my wind for later.

	<span class='label label-info column'>1039</span>
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Committee stages of agriculture Bills over the years, our discussions have always been marked by good humour and a lack of unpleasantness. The Minister himself has contributed to this. We have probed the Bills in a relaxed, thoughtful way, without wasting time, and they have been the better for it. If we are now to depart from that tradition, it is a matter for great regret, especially as we are about to deal with controversial new clauses. The more controversial the subject, the more important it is to deal with it in good humour.

Although I feel freed from the inhibitions which have restrained me up to now, I regret very much that this motion has been thought necesary. I hope the Minister can tell us when we shall be sitting on Tuesday and also when the Report stage will take place so that concerns which will not be able to be expressed in discussions on the new clauses will be able to be raised then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Loyal as ever, I rise to support my Front Bench. I would be more impressed by some of the arguments of the Opposition if, in the face of all-night sittings, they did not suggest that these matters could be dealt with by an extra five hours of discussion in this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, five sittings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition have said they need two sittings after Easter. Two times two and and a half makes five. Yet they claim this has to be replaced by evening and night sittings after evening and night sittings. What a lot of nonsense. Their mathematics are as bad as their logic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will be some sittings before Easter as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) expressed some regret that I was not at last night's dinner. I was invited two or three months' ago and accepted in principle, but when the invitation card arrived, it said that dinner jackets had to be worn. I do not wear a dinner jacket and I gathered from the organisation that I would cause some embarrassment to mem-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1040</span>
bers of the Conservative Party if I went without a dinner jacket, so I stayed here to get on with my Parliamentary business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are going against their best interests. It has been an interesting phenomenon of this Committee that, as soon as we got to a controversial matter involving acceptance or rejection of a principle, the Opposition stayed silent. As soon as it was a question of their saying whether they supported tenant farmers or landlords, they did not rise to speak. We are doing them a favour if we have longer sittings. It is possible that it will give them the opportunity to say something on the principle, so that it can be picked up by the two sides—tenant farmers and landlords—they do not wish to offend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) has made this speech on so many occasions that it is hardly worth bothering to comment on it. If he is so keen on hon. Members going into the Lobby, may we take it that he will be going into the Lobby with his hon. Friends to vote against the Government on the Left-wing amendment in tonight's defence debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought you might have ruled on that point, Mr. Costain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) sat down before I got the chance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, if I may express your implicit ruling for you, it would be completely improper for me to comment on the matter raised by the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are saying that five hours would be enough to cope with this problem. They are honourable men, why do we not take their word for it and say that the 4.30 p.m. sittings will end at 7 p.m.?—[Hon. Members: "No."]—I thought not. We are faced with a set of agricultural anarchists on the other side. The Minister has made errors during the passage of this Bill which I have mildly pointed out, but I support him on this motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to delay proceedings for long. My hon. Friends have said most of what needs to be said, but it is a pity the Minister
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0572">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1041</span>
has been pushed into putting down this motion by the Leader of the House and the Government Chief Whip. I am sure he did not wish it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have other interests to attend to. I am on the Services Committee, which is considering the broadcasting of the House and many other important matters. It is very difficult suddenly to re-arrange one's whole programme to fit in with this motion, which was presented to us without notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This measure affects a major piece of legislation passed many years ago. I know the Minister appreciates this point. The Bill will affect the Agricultural Holdings Act, and that is why it is essential that the new clauses should be discussed thoroughly and that we should have time to consult the people who will have to work them, such as lawyers who deal with agricultural matters and the professional bodies concerned. We must have adequate opportunity to consider the Bill's relationship with the major agriculture holdings Acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure the Minister's advisers have done their best to co-ordinate all the legislation, but I am not convinced that, in a few years' time, we shall not find we have made many rods for the backs of both tenants and landlords. I urge the Minister to reconsider the motion because of the major effect this Bill will have on legislation which has been the bible to landlords and tenants, and which may be affected in many ways which cannot be comprehended as we go through a Bill of this kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is the wish of the Minister to have a few all-night sittings to complete the work of this Committee before Easter, I am quite willing to do just that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the support of the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Cardigan may have to attend to his constituency, but I do not wish to get involved in a provocative argument with the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton). I know he has his difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not trying to curtail discussion. The hon. Member for Westmorland admitted that in his opening remarks. We are actually providing more time for discussion. I am always anxious that the Bill should be discussed freely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept the argument that we have only given short notice. I gave notice of my intentions in this Committee on 3rd February, and details of the scheme were given on 26th February. Any lawyer worth his salt will have gone through the Bill by now. If the hon. Member for Macclesfield has a lawyer who has not done so, it is no wonder he is getting such dilatory advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a question of the time lawyers have had to consider the Bill, it is the time they have had to re-organise their lives. We live in an ivory tower in this House if we imagine that a busy lawyer with court appearances booked months ahead can simply drop everything to consider the proposals of which the Government gave no notice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not true. Even on Second Reading the matter was discussed in principle. I have kept the Opposition informed throughout through the usual channels. Any lawyer worth his salt would be able to read this Bill in a week and give advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Minister has misunderstood the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Westonsuper-Marc (Mr. Wiggin). I know that any lawyer worth his salt will have read the Bill, but my hon. Friend has referred to the Association of Agricultural Lawyers, and while individuals will have read and considered the Bill, the difficulty has been for the Association to find the time to consider these proposals as a body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be true, but I have had adequate discussions. I discussed the measure with the CLA and with the legal advisers to the NFU. I understand the Opposition's point of view, but I feel they are exaggerating.

	<span class='label label-info column'>1043</span>
I want more discussion on the Bill. The hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) indicated that he has been told not to speak for too long. Apparently there was an attempt by the Opposition to curtail discussion. I hope that is not true. I was rather amused by what he said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had some very dirty looks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some people have referred to a speech in another place. It was not in the House of Lords, but at Claridges on a very enjoyable night. My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West did not go, for reasons he knows best, but I enjoyed it and I am glad my speech was broadly accepted by the assembled audience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the motion is agreed by the Committee, I am prepared to discuss, through the usual channels, how to get the Bill through, if possible, by Easter. The Opposition have made a valid point about Budget Day, and I shall consult the Government Whips about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister completes his remarks, would he direct his attention to the other duties and responsibilities of Members to this House, particularly to Select Committees? Would he bear in mind the Government's defeat on a matter of public expenditure' and the fact that certain members of this Committee are engaged in very important inquiries under the umbrella of the Select Committee on Public Expenditure? How can Members be torn between this Committee and a Select Committee and fulfil their responsibilities and duties to the full? I do not believe it is physically possible. I hope the Minister will not merely consult the usual channels—he describes them as the whips. He is the Minister and in a matter such as this he has to take a slightly more responsible attitude than he has.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman talks about the case put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body), who said he had had pressure brought upon him to keep his remarks relatively short. I have had pressure brought on me, not only from my own colleagues but also from the antagonistic
	<span class='label label-info column'>1044</span>
looks of the hon. Gentleman on the other side of the Committee who does whatever it is he does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why cannot we continue along the path we are now treading? This is a very important Bill. Why cannot we continue to meet in the morning on. Tuesdays and Thursdays? Why do we need to meet in the afternoon? Is there some more pernicious legislation waiting that the Government want to force through Committee?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is a reasonable man. If he had been here more often, some of the unfortunate amendments which have slipped through would not have been accepted by the Government. Let us deal with this Bill constructively and reasonably. I beg of him to reconsider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister also consider the specific points I put to him about the Report stage? This is important. If blemishes are to emerge from the new clauses, there ought to be ample opportunity to consider them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the importance of the argument that the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) has used about the Report stage. That is not entirely a matter for me, although, as Minister, I have responsibility. I will discuss it with the Leader of the House and my Chief Whip and the whip on this Committee. I would like to get the motion because I am anxious that we should have a decision by Easter. I take note of what the hon. Member has said. Originally, I expected to have the main discussion on Report. Representations were made to me by the Opposition, quite rightly. I conceded that it was better to argue out the details in this Committee rather than when matters are discussed later on the Floor of the House on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) may be faced with a difficulty. This has happened to many of us in our long political life. He is a young Member. I believe he has a safe seat. He will sit on many committees, and he will have to make this choice occasionally. He should not worry. I do not think he should be intimidated by the angry looks of members of the Government. Who knows, they may be sympathising with his dilemma.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad I have the support of my hon. Friends and the hon. Member for

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little disappointed</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Ellis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Member wants to make some remarks. I will give way to him if he wants to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that if we have to sit in the evenings, Mr. Costain, you will make it clear that we will not have to come in our dinner jackets. I would hate to think that the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr Buchan) was precluded from attending sessions of this Committee because he was worried about being improperly dressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find the Minister's reply disappointing. I was not pleased to hear that he wanted to have the motion first and then discuss how it might he implemented. That is putting the cart before the horse. I hope he can give us some assurances before we accept the motion. That is the right and proper way of dealing with</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>these things.</p>
	<p>After the Minister moved the motion, I referred to the fact that various bodies are still in the process of giving us their views. It was a matter totally unknown to me that the Association of Agricultural Lawyers had only been able to meet for the first time last night. Here is a new factor that I was not aware of and which greatly alarms me. We on this side have given a firm undertaking that, with a continuation of morning sittings, we will get through everything we want to say by the end of the Thursday in the week after the Recess. That should be adequate for the Government, and it will be considered helpful outside. If the Government are not prepared to accept that offer, we shall register our disapproval of the motion by voting against it. It is a small thjng that we ask and it is not unreasonable to ask it.</p>

	<li>the time within which the tenant could have required any question arising in connection wilh the notice to be determined by arbitration under that Act expired before that date without such a requirement having been made by the tenant, and the month allowed for serving any counter-notice in respect of that notice expired before that date without any such counter-notice having been served; or</li>

	<p>	<i>Amendment (q) proposed to the proposed new clause</i>[	<i>30th March</i>] in line 79, leave our paragraph (g)—[Mr. 	<i>Body.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a resumption of the remarks I was addressing in support of the amendment, which is effectively to expunge sub-paragraph (g) and to make this legislation applicable to smallholdings of various types.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have expressed my own difficulty in that, whilst I had great sympathy with the logic of the arguments advanced by the authorities, be they county councils or whatever, in the light of their objections and the statutory duties imposed upon them. I nevertheless found myself torn—Torn because what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. If the Government see it as proper to impose this legislation and these duties upon the private sector of the Agricultural industry, we should also visit them upon what I would loosely describe as the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) made an entirely valid point in a completely apolitical vein, although it does have important political reverberations. How could he, he said, encounter in one hour the tenant of some private holding who had a charter of succession and, an hour later, look in the eye the tenant of some statutory smallholding who had nothing to point to. apart from the particular rules as laid down by smallholding regulations made under order by the Minister, adopted and enlarged upon and duly enforced by the particular county council which decided that case? He went on to cite a particular instance of outrageous hardship brought about under present legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in two minds on this matter. I refer to the National Farmers Union brief dated 3rd March. Initially, my heart fell because amendments tend to be put and suggestions made in logical, numerical sequence, and I saw nothing on the first three pages. By that time, we had moved on through the Bill to new Clause 9. On page 4 of that brief, which bears the signature of Mr. M. R. Darke, Parliamentary Secretary to the National Farmers Union, we have reference to statutory smallholdings and new Clause 8 (5) (g).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be grounds here for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1050</span>
Minister indicating some kind of compromise. I am not clear as to the full implications in terms of the county council or the Land Settlement Association. I would like clarification as to whether the Land Settlement Association comes under (g) or (h). I am not clear about the full implication of what the NFU says. Perhaps the answer may lie along the lines indicated here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It suggests that the Minister may under take to invoke his power under Section 44 (6) of the Agriculture Act 1970 to make regulations replacing the smallholding section of the Tenants Regulations 1970. Statutory Instrument 1970, No. 1049, to ensure that preference will be given by smallholdings authorities to an application to the tenancy by a near relative of a deceased smallholder who otherwise would be a suitable smallholding tenant. Perhaps that is the answer. I am anxious to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary about this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not fully comprehend the meaning of these regulations. If subsection (g) is expunged, bringing smallholdings within the compass of these new clauses, there are responsible parties on the Suffolk County Council who believe they would have to consider, as a county, abandoning smallholdings entirely. I hope I have explained this clearly. I do not think it is emotional: it is quite objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be able to demonstrate to all members of the agricultural community that we have made endeavours—and perhaps we cannot go further—to treat them all reasonably and on all fours. Although my references have been almost exclusively to the county councils, the Land Settlement Association, of course, comprehends the Minister's own hopes, referred to directly and indirectly by my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will show his appreciation of the disquiet that is in hon. Member's minds, and I am sure that the hon. Member for Renfrew-shire, West (Mr. Buchan), is making his case, would express a concern similar to that he had with regard to the charter that will be available to the private

tenant, whereas the public sector tenant will have nothing comparable at which to point, thought often he, in terms of social strata—though that is not now a very acceptable expression—and certainly financial resources is frequently in a much less strong position. On all those grounds. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to give us an illuminating and sympathetic reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Initially, I felt that there was no real reason why county council smallholdings should be excluded, but I take the hon. Gentleman's point that it is as appropriate for justice to be seen to be done as it is for there to be justice. I have been impressed by the arguments on the National Farmers Union:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the main reason for exclusion of statutory smallholdings from the scheme altogether is because of the possible conflict that could arise between decisions of the smallholdings authority in pursuance of its governing legislation in the selection of a new tenant on the death of a sitting tenant and a decision of the agricultural lands tribunal under the present scheme."</p></blockquote>
The NFU makes the interesting suggestion that it is hoped that in these circumstances the Minister will use the regulatory powers under Section 46(6) of the Agriculture Act 1970 to ensure, in other words, that preference is given to applications from those with smallholdings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NFU is really saying that this is a method of ensuring that the principle applying to the private landlord will, so far as it possible, be applied also to the smallholding situation, without necessarily bringing those holdings into the local ambit of the scheme. Certainly, it is worth looking at. It might be advisable generally that this aspect should be brought out and that guidelines of some kind should be issued saying that the principle of the Bill should be taken into consideration in allocating tenancies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman be good enough to express his view, since he seems to exert a lot of influence from the Back Bench, on the other legal aspect, on those smallholdings controlled by the Ministry of Agriculture? He will know those I have in mind. In my constituency, there are the Sutton Bridge holdings, for example. If there is no evidence of democratic control there, surely there is no reason why they should not be on
	<span class='label label-info column'>1052</span>
the same footing as farms owned by the Ministry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not totally accept that assumption. Under any Government holding, a Minister is responsible and can be pursued, if necessary, on the Floor of the House. I do not accept the assumption that therefore there is a distinction involved in democratic control, but in these cases we would like to seek some method whereby it would seem that the principle we have established here was to apply as far as possible, and that that principle should at any rate be taken into account whatever the form of the smallholding. It is ironic that the Opposition should be pressing for an extension of this principle in the case of the private landlord. I hope my hon. Friend will not reject this out of hand, but will see whether there is some method whereby the principle can be applied or that, at any rate, guidelines can be issued.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a very wide-ranging debate and it is appropriate that we should have done so. It might be helpful if I remind hon. Members of the basic reasons for having smallholdings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present legislation on smallholdings came into effect only six years ago, in the Agriculture Act 1970 following a comprehensive review by a committee of inquiry under the chairmanship of Professor Wise. That committee reported that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the smallholdings estate is a large and valuable asset. It would be most undesirable to break it up and dispose of it. To do so would not be in the best interests of agriculture."</p></blockquote>
That still holds good today. The 1970 Act imposes certain duties and obligations on the local smallholdings authorities and the Minister in relation to their smallholdings estates, so they are not free as private landlords are to run their estates in any way they choose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exclusion of statutory smallholdings from the new clauses aroused considerable comment from hon. Members. I repeat the two reasons why they have been left out of the scheme so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the intention of Parliament under the 1970 Agriculture Act was that statutory smallholdings should be a gateway into farming for the new entrant, for example, the able and experienced young man who wished to take up a farming career. Secondly, unlike private landlords, who are answerable to nobody but them-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0578">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1053</span>
selves for their actions, smallholdings authorities are democratically elected bodies and their proceedings and decisions are open to public scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These smallholdings authorities carry out their selection of tenants with great care—I have seen some examples of the information they require from aplicants—and they weigh up the claims of a deceased tenant's close relatives with those of other applicants. Of course, where a holding is scheduled for amalgamation with other land in accordance with Ministerially-approved reorganisation plans for their estates, the holding would not normally be available for re-letting. Unlike private landlords, they do not take land in hand to farm themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In effect, the local authorities go through much the same procedure when selecting new tenants as the Agricultural Land Tribunal under our proposals. Moreover, if they use their powers unfairly or unreasonably, they are answerable for their actions to their electorate, just as my right hon. Friend is answerable to this House for the use of his powers in the selection of his tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As recently as 26th February, my right hon. Friend answered a Question on this very subject about the son of one of his deceased tenants who is the constituent of the hon. Member for Holland with Boston. (Mr. Body), and we are in process of drafting a reply to the hon. Member on another such case. Therefore, I agree absolutely with my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) an element, to put it at its most modest, of democratic control is exercised on the Ministry's holdings as well as on local authority smallholdings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are always difficult cases, such as the one which the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) quoted on Tuesday, which arise because the holding is required for amalgamation. I cannot comment on the hon. Gentleman's case—I do not know the circumstances—but there was no question there of rendering the family of the deceased tenant homeless—the authority found them another cottage, I understand. Tenants' sons with the necessary agricultural experience who apply for a holding of their own have usually been successful in getting one—possibly because most estates are fairly sizeable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is certainly true of my right hon. Friend's smallholdings estates, where there
	<span class='label label-info column'>1054</span>
are many sons of past and present tenants farming on their own account. The Committee may be interested to learn that my right hon. Friend has had no representations whatsoever from tenants on his smallholdings estates about the proposal to exclude statutory smallholdings from the scheme, whether at Sutton Bridge and Holbeach or the Land Settlement Association's estates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The inference to be drawn from this is that they know they are getting a fair deal from their landlord—a confidence which I am happy to be able to assure the Committee is not misplaced. I have agreed to visit tenants on the estates, and if that is an over-statement I will learn the position at first-hand from them. I am sure the hon. Gentleman will be happy to leave that point there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to points raised by the hon. Member for Holland with Boston and the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton). The former was very surprised when we answered his Question of 17th March, listing all the Ministry's farms which would be covered by our succession proposals. These are proper farms, and I emphasise that the exclusion applies only to the Ministry's smallholdings—that is, smallholdings as defined under the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was concerned that perhaps the present Government had extended the number of farms in public ownership. That is not so. We have not purchased any of these farms during the period of this Government. I cannot be sure about the Conservative Government. That Government did extend public ownership considerably in an important sector of the economy but I believe I am right in saying, although I may be corrected, that they did not extend public ownership in this field, apart, perhaps, from buying a farm to be used as an experimental farm. There is no question of these farms having been taken over in recent years by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holland with Boston would like smallholdings tenants to be included under the present legislation. The hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge, towards the end of his speech, did not, I notice, say it in quite as black-and-white terms as his hon. Friend. He spoke of an interest and said some members of his county council felt strongly that smallholdings should be excluded, and were strongly in favour of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0579">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1055</span>
Government's current approach, and that if that were changed they would seriously consider whether it was sensible as a county council to continue with smallholdings at all. One can understand the thinking behind that, because these holdings serve as a gateway. I acknowledge that it may well be that people do not go on to larger holdings as much as they did in the past. But it is certainly very common in our own Land Settlement Association schemes for people to move on to larger holdings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to have more details, and perhaps the hon. Gentleman will undertake to write to me. This was discussed at some length by my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body), who questioned whether this was a juxtaposition of a gateway or a 	<i>cul de sac.</i> But certainly, in the view of the Land Settlement Association people, who are fairly important, and in terms of county council holdings in East and West Suffolk, now amalgamated, the hon. Gentleman's reference to " gateway " is vastly over-stated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strank</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly write to the hon. Gentleman with the figures. I have studied them and they are impressive in that, in almost every case, a son wanting a holding has been successful, and he has not waited to get his father's holding but, by and large, has managed to get another one on the estate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An interesting point is the high proportion of sons who opt to go into some other activity. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman in detail as we have closely examined the matter. I am impressed by the extent to which the sons of farmers, or occupiers of holdings, were successful in obtaining holdings on the estates of the Land Settlement Association.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure whether the Minister was referring only to Land Settlement Association holdings or to county council holdings as well. There has been a great reduction in the number of smallholdings as a result of the amalgamation that has already taken place. In the next 10 years or so, there will bo a further reduction. That means that many farmers' sons will be excluded from obtaining holdings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many fanners' sons have told me that
	<span class='label label-info column'>1056</span>
they have been unable to obtain a holding. Of course, not all farmers have only one son. Many have several sons. However, even if farmers had only one son apiece, the fact remains that the number of statutory smallholdings has been reduced by almost half.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to the Land Settlement Association, for which we have detailed figures. I shall try to obtain the relevant figures to see whether the position is as bad as the hon. Gentleman describes in the county council sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton), is that the Land Settlement Association holdings are smallholdings as defined under the 1970 Act. The hon. Gentleman has said that he has had difficulty in reaching a decision. The Government have given the matter considerable consideration. We are certain that it would not be appropriate to include smallholdings in the Bill. However, my right hon. Friend has listened to our debates and he feels that we should be prepared to consider this issue in consultation with the Association of County Councils in the light of the remarks that have been made by the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be no question of us making the amendment by means of this legislation. As hon. Members have acknowledged, it will be appropriate to amend the regulations under the Agricultural Act 1970.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope hon. Members will acknowledge that we have moved some considerable way in responding to their views. I hope they will agree it is not appropriate to press the amendment. I also hope they will be able to accept my assurance that we shall reconsider the position of smallholdings under the regulations that stem from the 1970 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that arises is when this matter will be looked at. Will we have an opportunity to consider the "looking at"? Will we have that opportunity on Report? If we do not, we shall probably wish to table amendments, or at least to have the opportunity of considering amendments. We want more than we have had from the hon. Gentleman. We want to know precisely when he will come out with what he is looking at.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that of all the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0580">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1057</span>
debates we have had on the seven new clauses, it is probably this amendment that has given me the greatest difficulty when considering the right line to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that we shall find increasingly that as the supply of rented farms dries up—that will happen partly as a consequence of taxation and partly because of the increased drying up process which the Bill will establish—very few farms will be available for rent, and that those that become available will comand a high price. We shall find increasingly that smallholdings become less and less a gateway—the word that the Parliamentary Secretary used to describe their purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can envisage a time when an increasingly loud voice will be saying that the smallholding system may well have served its usefulness. I can envisage that in the years to come there will be a cry from various sectors to suggest that county council smallholdings should be sold off to the sitting tenants, or that they should be given the opportunity to buy them. However, that is not what we are debating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dilemma before us is whether we should vote to extend what we have already said goes too far, or condone what is clearly an anomaly. We have already made it clear that we believe the seven new clauses go too far in their effect. By removing this provision, we should only extend what we have already said goes too far. On the other hand, do we allow an anomaly to be created whereby there will be two distinct types of farm tenant?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the end my reaction to the amendment is not to vote in its support. I think that it would probably be wrong to extend what we have already said goes too far. I do not know what will be the reaction of my hon. Friends the Members for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) and Holland with Boston (Mr. Body). That is a matter for them. In view of the real dilemma in which we are placed, and in view of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, I believe it would be inadvisable to vote in favour of the amendment. I do not know whether my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston will wish to press it. That is a matter for him. However, I do not invite my hon. Friends to vote in its favour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was present when this matter was
	<span class='label label-info column'>1058</span>
discussed. I understand that it is a difficult matter. I believe that the Bill is the wrong vehicle for such considerations, but, having got so far, I cannot say in all fairness that we should go ahead and treat a section of farmers as second-class tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary indicated a way in which our difficulties may be overcome. I shall be glad to have the further assurance that the matter will be discussed with the Association of County Councils. That would be especially relevant in my constituency. I have always believed that these considerations should be confined to the son. Given the assurance to which I have referred, I believe that we can meet the wishes of the majority of tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want a full answer to the question posed by my hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stain-ton). I want to know when the consultation will begin. This matter must have already been discussed for some months with the Association of County Councils. The Parliamentary Secretary cannot mean that there will be an entirely fresh start.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we shall have some assurance that the consultation will begin immediately, and that the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to make a statement before Report or on Report as to the stage he has reached. If nothing is to happen, we shall then have an opportunity to table amendments. If my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) is prepared to withdraw this amendment on the basis of the hon. Gentleman's assurance, I hope that the Minister will be able to be a bit more forthcoming and allow us to know a little more about what is in his mind, and the likely time table.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My sentiments are entirely those of my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins). That is inevitable, as the problems of his constituency are similar to those of mine. There is one fresh matter that causes me some concern—namely, the Land Settlement Association. Surely it is in a very different position. The association's smallholdings are truly smallholdings. They should be the stepping stones to something better and larger. I regret that some of the tenants of the association's holdings have stayed on longer than they should.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0581">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the association's holdings are small—often they consist of eight or 10 acres—they are often highly intensive and produce a more than adequate life for the tenant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The right hon. Member for Anglesey (Mr. Hughes), when he was Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, was amazed by the results that were obtained from these holdings. I am now talking about the position that obtained some 10 years ago. The right hon. Gentleman found that tenants of two-acre holdings were then able to earn about £3,000 a year. He was amazed that that could be done on such small but intensive holdings. That is all the more reason for them being used as an opportunity to move up the ladder that used to exist. The holdings should continue to be used as a ladder. I hope that a distinction will be drawn between the Land Settlement Association holdings and the so-called smallholdings of the county councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have tried to be helpful. I think that hon. Members have acknowledged that that has been our attitude. I give an undertaking that we shall enter into consultations right away with a view to reaching a decision and an understanding. The hon. Members for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) and Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) have acknowledged that they have an open view and that they see both sides of the argument. In view of the extent to which we have been able to be forthcoming, I hope that the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) will be prepared to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the assurances that have been given by the Parliamentary Secretary, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move as an amendment to the proposed Clause, Amendment (	<i>r</i>) in line 83, leave out paragraph (h).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment relates to tenancies held by ex-Servicemen, men who have been granted tenancies by various trusts that are in existence for that very purpose. I believe, that only a very few such charitable trusts have been established, but those that exist enable men who have
	<span class='label label-info column'>1060</span>
served in the Navy, Army or Air Force to have a start in agriculture. In many cases, it was not intended to be a start. I understand that the purpose was to enable those who had gone to war to return and to find a place in agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were a number of reasons for the trusts being established. Most of those who were engaged in agriculture were exempt from conscription, yet many farmworkers and farmers' sons went to the First and Second World Wars. They left the land to go to war and they found that they missed opportunities for promotion at the farms on which they had been working, or missed opportunities to acquire a tenancy or even to buy a farm when it fell vacant. One of the purposes of the trusts was to give volunteers for war service an opportunity to catch up and to avoid them being prejudiced because they had gone to fight when perhaps they need not have done so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was another candidate, namely, the wounded soldier, very often not wounded physically but mentally. This applied especially to many cases in the First World War, when soldiers suffered greviously from shell-shock. It was a wonderful thing for so many of them to be able to come back to this country and find a place on the land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<i>THE CHAIRMAN'S attention having been called to the fact that six Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room, and six Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those who were well off acquired a poultry farm, and we know how many did such a thing between the wars, or took on some sort of horticultural enterprise or market gardening. It was an enormous solace for them to go back to civilian life and earn a modest livelihood on the land. But that was only those who were well off and could afford such smallholdings. Many soldiers who came back could not afford to acquire such an enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These charitable trusts filled in that gap and granted tenancies to those who would not otherwise have had such an opportunity. It would be a nonsense obviously to force trusts that were set up to protect and look after ex-Servicemen to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0582">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1061</span>
pass on the holdings to sons, sisters and other relations in accordance with the rest of these new clauses, but in my submission a distinction can be drawn between such relations and the widow. There can only be a very few cases in this category now. I put a Question down to the Parliamentary Secretary about this, and I think I am right in saying there are only eight such holdings affected by this part of the new clause. Therefore, there could only be a few like these widows who would need to stay on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sugesting that the whole of this new clause should be deleted. Obviously, no one has suggested that the son should follow. That would he ludicrous and defeat the purpose of the provision. But I suggest a case could be made out for allowing widows to stay on. The probability is, of course, that these trusts would allow the widows to continue in occupation of the tenancy, but there may be occasions when they will not. I do not go along with the views that trusts of this kind will necessarily be a better or worse landlord than the private one. If we are going to impose restrictions on the private landlord, I suggest that we can call upon charitable trusts to act in the same way towards widows' as one would wish them to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the case of a charitable trust which has as its role or principal object the settlement of employment in agriculture for persons who have served in Her Majesty's Armed Forces, it would be impossible for the trustees to carry out fully the obligations imposed on them by the trust if the family succession scheme were to apply to holdings on land vested in them. I am glad the hon. Member acknowledged that in his remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without the exemption provided by paragraph (h), the trustees would be faced with an impossible situation when a tenant died leaving a close relative who wished to become the tenant and who satisfied the conditions of the scheme. The holding would not then be available for letting to an ex-Serviceman and the terms of the trust could not be met. We know of only one trust of that kind, and less than a dozen tenancies are involved. To set the record straight, in reply to the Question by the hon. Member, I estimated that 10 tenants would be affected. I am sympathetic to his remarks about the widows. One would expect the trust to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1062</span>
see that there was alternative accommodation, because I am sure it is the question of the roof over their heads that worries the hon. Member. I do not think the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Have the Government had any discussions with the trusts concerned as to whether they can give assurances?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The best way I can respond to the hon. Gentleman is to say we will look at this point. To date, as I understand it, no direct discussions have taken place. We are discussing a new clause which has clearly substantial ramifications right across the board, and the situation we are talking about here refers to one trust involving 10 tenancies. It is not surprising that we have not been able to make any detailed enquiries on that point. It may well be that some discussions have taken place which I am not aware of. I will write to him on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It would seem that the Government, in drafting the new clause, have not given necessary attention to this point. I hope they will give careful thought before rejecting this amendment, if they reject it, and will give some undertaking to have another look at the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be irrelevant and wrong at this time, when so much time and energy is being spent on amalgamation of holdings and the creation of more efficient
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0583">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1063</span>
units, to allow tenants to succeed under the provisions of this new clause to unviable or noncommercial holdings. The point is no more complicated or elaborate that that. It is particularly important to exclude unviable holdings, for the quite obvious reasons that if the tenant is to have this security for, say, 90 or 100 years, which is effectively what we are all agreed now is likely to be the case, it is ludicrous to give that security on what is genuinely accepted as an unviable holding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Member define an unviable unit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The term
	<br><blockquote><p>"commercial unit of agricultural land"</p></blockquote>
is defined in the Agriculture Act 1967. In practice, the definition is dependent upon the cropping and stocking of the farm and related to a standard labour requirement measured normally in man-days. Those hon. Members with some knowledge of the subject will understand the term and the method of calculation. The present yardstick is that farms with 600 standard man-days or more are now judged to be commercial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have an example here for a small dairy farm, say, 32 cows at 10 man-days each, that is 320 standard man-days: eight heifers in calf at 3.5 man-days is 28 standard man-days: 20 other cattle at 2.5 man-days: 100 ewes at 0.7 man-days: 60 acres of ley at 0.75 man-days: 10 acres of permanent grass at 0.5 man-days; five acres of kale at 1.5 man-days. A 75-acre farm could have added to this total a further 15 per cent. for maintenance giving the figure of 603 standard man-days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the man-days criteria are open to a good deal of criticism, but we have been using them and the Ministry have been using them for many years—I am not sure precisely how long. t is generally understood in the industry that they are the yardstick. I suspect that those who fall below the standard think it is not a good one, but most other people accept them, and they have become used for many other matters concerning the application of grants and assistance and decisions on amalgamation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments (s) and (t) largely mean the same things and lead to the obvious implication that it would be wrong to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1064</span>
shackle, if that is the right word, the tenant and his family to a holding that is measured to be unviable, and measured by a generally accepted standard. I would have thought that if we do this we will make it harder for landlords to create viable holdings in future. Most people in the agricultural industry accept the necessity of amalgamation and for creating a basic unit which allows the family a proper living. I hope the Minister will accept the general point if not the precise words in these amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) gave a clear explanation of what we mean by "commercial unit". He is right to rely on this unit of man-days. I have to explain that we cannot accept these amendments, and the reason is simple.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In England and Wales in 1974, disregarding statutory smallholdings, there were about 21,000 wholly-rented agricultural holdings of commercial size within the meaning of Part II of the Agriculture Act 1967, and about 29,000 holdings below commercial size. The effect of these amendments therefore would be arbitrarily to exclude from the family succession scheme more than half the wholly-rented holdings in England and Wales. As far as the Government are concerned, that is simply not on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the scheme, any eligible person will be able to apply to the Agricultural Land Tribunal for consent to succeed to the tenancy of a holding regardless of its size, and the landlord will have the opportunity—under the provisions of new Clause 11—to apply for the tribunal's consent for the operation of the notice to quit. In addition to the grounds set out in Section 25(1) of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948, there is to be a further ground, namely, that the holding is not a commercial agricultural unit and is required for amalgamation within two years of the termination of the tenancy through death, with other land to form a commercial unit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be up to the landlord to develop his own case on this ground, and the tribunal would make up its mind having heard the applications of the parties. We cannot respond to the hon. Member's amendment by striking out all those holdings which are not commercially defined in the way he has described. What we have done is to write additionally into
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0584">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1065</span>
the new clause the provision that where the landlord wants vacant possession of that holding specifically to amalgamate with another commercial-size holding to create a commercial holding, the ALT must take that into account, and it will be a wonderful argument in support of the landlord's notice to quit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have gone some way towards meeting the point of the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) in relation to non-commercial units, but, for the reasons I have given, we cannot accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Though I agree with part of what the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) said, I am grateful for the way the Under-Secretary has looked at this matter because I spoke strongly on the subject of nonviable industry at an earlier sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a social pattern in Wales which includes many part-time tenant farmers. For instance, the local postman and other people might farm 10 or 20 acres, and it is important to retain this structure in rural areas. Could the Under-Secretary enlarge on the subject of the part-time system we have in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge what the Minister has said about writing into this clause this additional ground on which a landlord may go to the tribunal. Will he draw the attention of the CLA to this part of the clause, because this has been one of its major fears, and I am not sure that it appreciates the fact that this provision has been written in?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister has said is significant, despite the supposition of his right hon. Friend that it is easy to accept eight new clauses of a technical nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot immediately put my finger on the precise point in the Bill where this becomes an item to take before the tribunal. I suspect it is under new Clause 10. The result is that half the holdings in this country may have a let-out, since landlords will be able to apply to the tribunal on the grounds that it is in the interests of the estate and good husbandry that farms should be amalgamated—and this will be the case on almost every occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the aim of my amendment, it is
	<span class='label label-info column'>1066</span>
right and proper and in the interests of the nation, but I hope that small farmers appreciate what is being done. However, I would be arguing against myself if I said it was wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to hon. Members for their remarks. The system described by the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells) is similar to the crafting system which we always regarded as unique to the north of England. We shall look at the question of small part-time units when we are considering the other point raised by the hon. Member—the position of a holding where a son could not reasonably be expected to be working full time with his father.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposal is spelled out clearly in new Clause 11(3)(	<i>f</i>). This would provide a further ground which the tribunal will have to take into account, namely, where a landlord wishes to amalgamate two units to create a commercial unit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the philosophy in new Clause 11(3)(	<i>f</i>). It must be right. It is in line with everything the Government have done and everything the Minister has done in his tenure of office in this and other Parliaments. However, the Parliamentary Secretary must not adopt too the Liberal Party asset of being able to look both ways at once. It will be difficult to deal with the point made by the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells) and to work towards viable holdings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must warn the Minister that, while we are prepared to withdraw the amendment, particularly in view of the assurances he has given, any change of philosophy would not be acceptable to this side. We must have an efficient agricultural industry in the competitive years ahead. Anybody who has studied the industry knows that the basic size of a holding is the raw material.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Member not interested in looking after the small man in this country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never said that. In the Cheddar Valley, in my constituency, plenty of people are making a living on two or three acres. In terms of standard man-days, their output is probably grossly in excess of 600. Two acres in the Cheddar Valley might be in equivalent of 500 acres in the Welsh hills. It is no good measuring a holding by acreage, it is a matter of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0585">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1067</span>
viability. The hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells) knows there is a limit to the production of a unit. The Ministry has chosen to measure it in man-days. There is room for argument on that basis of measurement, but it is reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of part-time holdings affects all smallholders, and I do not see that there can be a compromise. A smallholder may have a non-viable unit and, in order to make it and others more viable, there may have to be amalgamation. That is when we have a direct conflict of interest and why I warned the Parliamentary Secretary to be cautious about looking both ways at once.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not envy the Minister having to solve this dilemma, but solve it he must, and I believe the best way is by using new Clause 11 as drafted. That would be a perfectly reasonable way of dealing with the problem, and I am very satisfied with the Government's handling of this matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed.</i> That the clause, as amended be added to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think everyone will agree that new Clause 8 is the guts of the matters we have been discussing in the last seven Sittings. The Government's position in these debates has been a shifting one; their attitude has changed from the time we first started discussing these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have stuck on some points through thick and thin and I was surprised at their refusal to meet some of our suggestions. For instance, I was extremely surprised that they did not take the point we were making about treated children. Someone who bears no blood relation, and little other relation, to a tenant will be able to apply and possibly obtain the tenancy of a holding. We referred to the position of a land girl who may have stayed on after the war, and that epitomises our argument. There is likely to be a trade in young men, wanting to start farming, being able to manipulate new Clause 8 so that they can become eligible persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It comes ill from the Labour Party to be putting through legislation which will add to the wealth and possessions of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1068</span>
people who are already sufficiently well-off to be able to set up as tenant farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also been alarmed to see that the Government's position on hardship has been shifted. On the 3rd February, the Minister referred in column 420 of our 	<i>Official Report</i> to the Government's decision to meet the desire of the NFU for a limited scheme of family succession with appropriate safeguard to avoid hardship. When the Government started on these measures, their mind was specifically directed towards dealing with hardship. We acknowledge, as we have throughout our debates, that there is a case for dealing with extreme cases of hardship, but our view of hardship and the Government's view have diverged in the last two or three weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can illustrate that divergence by referring to the Government's astonishing decision to accept the amendment of their Back-Benchers to delete the word "agriculture" from line 40 of the new clause when it refers to a full-time course at university, college or other establishment of further education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that when we are talking of hardship, I do not think we can reasonably say there is serious hardship when a young man spends three years at university doing a full-time course in archaeology, history or another subject which has nothing to do with agriculture or studies closely associated with farming He could have worked for two years on the farm and then he could have spent two years writing a book or working in a capacity which had nothing to do with agriculture. I cannot believe that, at the end of the seven years, we could say that this young man was suffering great hardship if he did not get the tenancy of his father's farm on his father's death.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is as far as the Government have gone. Their view of hardship seems to me to be a shifting one. Now we are told something more, that between now and Report they are going to proceed in other ways. They propose to re-examine subsection 3(	<i>b</i>). That implies that there is to be yet another shift, perhaps in the event of the earlier decease of the young man's father. The young man who has spent three years at the university doing non-agricultural studies, two years doing something else which has nothing to do with agriculture, and only part of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0586">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1069</span>
remaining two years on the farm, on his father's death could say he ought to have the tenancy or be able to obtain it against the wishes of the landlord. I cannot escape the view that the motivation for this, which we know springs from certain Back-Bench Members on the Government side.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Edward Bishop)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And also the NFU.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State must hear what I was going to say. The main motivation in these matters is not necessarily particularly and solely to deal with hardship. A good deal of vindictiveness has crept into hon. Members' attitudes with regard to "getting at" agricultural landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was very disappointed to hear the Government's reply when we had the debate on our amendment which would have allowed a landlord's son who wished to take over his father's farm on the death of his father's tenant—a man who had had long experience of working in agriculture—an equal opportunity with the tenant's son of claiming the tenancy before the Agricultural Land Tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have reached a position that there could be a tenant's son who had spent five of the seven years before the tenant'sdeath doing something which had nothing to do with agriculture and had spent only two years working on the farm. Thelandlord's son might have worked on an adjoining farm for the entire seven-year period and might be far more suitable to take over the farm. One might say both young men would suffer hardship if they did not get the tenancy. I fail to understand why one should then leave the tenancy to the tenant's son rather than to the landlord's son. It is wholly unreasonable. I was very glad the hon. Member for Durham (Mr. Hughes) put his name to that amendment. I hope we shall be able to return to that matter on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have said that it is right to deal with cases of extreme hardship where they occur. We have also said we believe that the proposals in this new clause go too far. We have directed our arguments to deal with the situation in that light. We shall take further opportunities to try to amend the new clause when we reach Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1070</span>
Now that we have had our detailed and particular discussion, it would be helpful if the Government could give us some idea of their attitude to the clause as a whole. Would the Parliamentary Secretary tell us what the Government's view is of our allegation that we see a shifting Government position, that we see the concept of hardship being diluted further and further so far as the landlord's son is concerned? It would help us greatly in our attitude to this clause, and our future attitude, if he will make it quite clear that the Government do not intend to shift their position any further. We hope they will be able to accept some of our amendments put down to future clauses, particularly new clause 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not referred to the fact that the Government did accept one of our amendments—a very sensible and helpful thing to do. They could hardly have failed to accept that amendment. If it had not been accepted, it would have added further to the anomalies. It would have meant that a young man could claim a tenancy who had no agricultural experience of any sort. Not only would he be excused from doing an agricultural course at an institute of further education, he would not necessarily do agricultural work on the premises. He could be running a haulage business or practising as a chartered accountant. That would be totally wrong. If we had not put our amendment, that young man with the so-called case of suffering hardship need not have had any agricultural experience at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a good moment for the Parliamentary Secretary to re-state the Government's attitude in general so far as hardship is concerned and what their attitude will be on the very delicate balance over hardship in the discussions which lie before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise simply to remind the Parliamentary Secretary of his earlier remarks concerning death. I have had an opportunity to read his remarks. He gave an undertaking. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I propose, therefore, to table an amendment on Report to provide that only when a tenancy passes from a deceased tenant to a close relative, whether by agreement or as a result of a decision by the ALT, will it count as one succession".—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee</i> C, 30th March 1976; c 1008.]</p></blockquote>
Later on, I raised the question of retirement or a voluntary succession prior to death. He said he would deal with it in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0587">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1071</span>
"clause stand part". It is most important in relation to discussions subsequently on amendments and new clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very important new clause. In much of the comment on this, before the Minister made his announcement and he tabled our new clauses, it was clear that a great deal of the criticism in the country, and to some extent in this House, arose from the impression that we would grant automatic succession and that the son of the tenant would succeed automatically to the holding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The importance of the new clause is that it spells out how tightly drawn we envisage the scheme in practice. It lays down exactly who can apply to the Agricultural Land Tribunal, who will be deemed as an eligible person and who cannot apply. We had considerable discussion on this matter of an eligible person. The Opposition was concerned that it was too wide and wanted to confine it to the son, the daughter and the spouse, whereas my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), wanted it extended to the farm worker who had worked on the holding. The Committee reached its decision on these points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding the reference by the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) to the landlord's son, I would remind him that we said we envisaged the tribunal taking into account the position of the landlord's son in ascertaining the question of greater hardship. There is no objection to the son of the landlord appearing before the tribunal in relation to the landlord's notice to quit. The statutory instrument will be revised, in consultation with the NFU and other bodies, to make this clear and to set out the full procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made it absolutely clear that we intend that justice should take place and, where the landlord had a stronger claim, perhaps on the basis of his son compared to the son of the tenant, the Agricultural Land Tribunal would he fully empowered to take this into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several of my hon. Friends considered that the principal source of livelihood test would be unnecessarily restrictive and that there would be cases of hardship where the father died before the son completed five years' work on the holding. My hon. Friend the Member for Dudley,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1072</span>
West (Dr. Phipps) and the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells) were concerned about these points. We have given an undertaking regarding them. We are considering how to give the Agricultural Land Tribunal a discretionary power to make this less rigid, but the link with the holding will have to be retained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the conduct of the proceedings the Opposition wanted two assessors to sit with the Agricultural Land Tribunal. We had a lengthy debate on that point. I have undertaken, in response to hon. Members, that we will write to the tribunal's chairman drawing attention to the desire-ability of using assessors where that is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened to the hon. Gentleman's remarks regarding our decision to broaden the educational qualification. I am sure you would not want us to go over that ground again, Mr. Costain, but I remind him that, whereas we accepted that broadening, we resisted the amendment which would have extended the period from three to four years. On the very controversial point regarding two generations, something on which my hon. Friend the Member for Durham spoke very strongly on Second Reading, my right hon. Friend has stood firm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think we should refer to the "two generations", but to "two successions", which alters the position considerably. It also raises the matter of what is meant when the Government say they are achieving a balance on this. Could we clarify further what is meant by "balance" in choosing the figure of two?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for reminding me that it is better to use the word "successions" rather than "generations". My right hon. Friend answered the question about balance when it was said earlier. My sole purpose in referring to it now was to respond to the hon. Gentleman's unfair accusation that we have sought to be vindictive to the landlords in the course of these proceedings. That was quite unfair and uncalled for. As the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) says, we could have gone a lot further in many respects in relation to the Scottish scheme, which is an obvious parallel. I want to put on record that it was preposterous for the hon. Member
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0588">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1073</span>
for Westmorland to seek to imply that hon. Members in this Committee, and in particular the Government, had been vindictive towards private landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to a very important point. I am grateful that the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) raised again the question of retirement and when a succession is deemed to be a succession. It was the general view of the Committee that succession by agreement on the death of the tenant should be permitted under this scheme. The Government intend to amend subsection (5)(	<i>f</i>) to make it clear that, whenever a tenancy passes on death to a close relative, whether by agreement or as a result of a direction by the Agricultural Lands Tribunal, it will count as one succession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards retirement, dealt with in new clauses 15 and 16, we intend to provide that this, too, will count as one succession where the tenant, the close relative and the landlord are all in agreement. New Clause 16 goes much wider than the simple case of agreed retirement and is best left for consideration until the Committee reaches it, but I have given an undertaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caerwyn Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On this question of retirement counting as one succession, does my hon. Friend realise—I am sure he must—that it would be a total disincentive if it were so counted? Who is going to agree to this procedure when he knows that there is only one more succession to go before it passes out of his hands?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend might want to think again about that. After all, the intention under the Bill as it stands, as we have drawn the new clauses, would be that the son would succeed on his father's death. We have provided only that the son can succeed before his father's death, and the length of time over which this can apply is not altered. It merely means that it will take place earlier. On the last succession, when we have exhausted two successions, it will be up to the farmer himself whether or not to apply, but if my hon. Friend thinks about it he will realise that it will not affect the length of time covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The critical factor will be the length of time over the two successions. There
	<span class='label label-info column'>1074</span>
is acknowledgment of the important point that there can be two successions. We had a very useful debate with regard to smallholdings, and here again the Government showed how responsive they are to the Committee's views on these matters. I must tell the hon. Member for Westmorland that it is really a little contradictory, on the one hand to criticise us for shifting our ground—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The wrong way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says "the wrong way", but we have responded very often to cogent points raised by the Opposition, as we have very substantially to important points raised by my hon. Friends. The point of having Committee proceedings is for the Government to listen carefully to all the suggestions that are made and, where those have merit and substance, to be flexible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is hard that the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) should criticise us for being unresponsive. He himself has asked that we should be sympathetic and give a careful hearing to amendments that he and his hon. Friends will be moving on future clauses. I am happy to give hon. Members that assurance. As we have had a very full debate—and I do not know how many Sittings we have spent on just one new clause—new Clause 8—I would hope that all hon. Members would be reasonable and allow the Committee to agree to enable this clause to be added to the Bill and move on to the next.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the Minister for what he has said in relation to a son being able to be heard in front of a tribunal. I understood that he said something quite contrary the other day. One or two cases of hardship will be created by this provision, I feel sure. For example, there is the case of the son of a first brother when two brothers are farming in partnership, with only the older brother being the tenant. When that tenant dies, his brother will be more likely to inherit than the son of the first tenant, who may be only 16 or 17. He will never have an opportunity to apply to the agricultural land tribunal and the succession will go to the second brother. That is the kind of hardship which arises from this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also grateful to the Minister for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0589">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1075</span>
his reference to retirement. If his hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) thinks about it, he will realise that it will be good for farming. The point that was made about older tenants hanging on is quite correct, and I am glad of what the Minister has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks me to think about it. I would ask him to think about it. It is more likely they will hang on rather than speed up retirement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As long as there is succession to take place under registration, there will be no incentive to hold on. On the contrary, he might want to settle earlier. It is only when we get to the end, to the situation when two successions have been exhausted, that there is a completely new ball game. The Committee has taken its decision but the hon. Member will realise that what matters is what comes out of retirement, the total duration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like every other hon. Member, I wish to resolve this matter before we rise. I look upon this new Clause as germane to the whole philosophy of the Government in this matter.

	<p>tried as far as possible to meet some of the points made from this side, but equally his hon. Friends have attempted on at least two separate occasions to introduce a new philosophy—for example, in relation to the period of succession, covering part of the Government's original statement—and their other thoughts show their intention not just to allow the system to continue to work but to deprive a landlord of the right to enjoy his property, as far as they are concerned, in perpetuity.</p>
	<p>As a beneficiary under the landlord and tenant system, I could not honestly allow such legislation to go through all its proceedings without at least once registering my personal protest. I ask my hon. Friends—I am not sure I can carry them with me on this—to remember two things. First, despite what the right hon. Gentleman says, this will finish the supply of new farms for renting on the open market. Already, there are very few, and these will no longer be offered. Secondly, is it right that we should pass a law removing from enjoyment of their property the rights of landlords or landowners over many years? I could not possibly allow those two basic principles to go through without registering at least one protest, and I propose to do so on this new clause.</p>

	<li>none of the applicants is determined by the Tribunal to be in their opinion a suitable person to become the tenant of the holding; or</li>

	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under subsection (1), a notice to quit served on the death of a tenant under Section 24(2)(g) shall not have effect unless one of three sets of circumstances apply. First, if no application for the tenancy is made to the Agricultural Land Tribunal within the relevant period; or second, if an application has been made but the tribunal determines that no applicant is a suitable person to become a tenant of the holding; or third, although the tribunal may determine that an applicant is suitable to become a tenant of the holding, it nevertheless consents to the landlord's application for the notice to quit to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) defines the relevant period. Applications to take over the tenancy of the holding have to be made to the tribunal within the three months immediately following the death of the tenant; or, if the tenant dies between the passing of the Act and the end of the year, the period of three months beginning on 1st January, 1977. As a fall-back provision, the Lord Chancellor may by order prescribe a later date if that became necessary. This is a very important but procedural new clause, and I do not think hon. Members will wish to spend a great deal of time on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not often agree with the Parliamentary Secretary but I can do so on his last words because I do not think there is any point in spending too much time on this new clause. which I agree is basically procedural. On Subsection (2) we have put down an amendment which gives rise to the main questions arising from it. It would be better to move on fairly quickly to our amendment, which allows us to raise
	<span class='label label-info column'>1078</span>
certain questions of the need for the subsection and matters concerning the relevant period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe major issues arise with regard to a notice to quit under subsection (24X2)(gg) of the 1948 Act, which need not concern us much at this stage unless some of my hon. Friends wish to raise certain matters and it might be best to move through this debate and on to our amendment fairly quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have just referred to this amendment and must ask the Government why they have thought it necessary to bring in subsection (2) and particularly subparagraph (	<i>b</i>), which seems to be rather an anomaly. I would have thought that first phrases in new Clause 8
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where after the passing of this Act the tenant of an agricultural holding dies and is survived by any of the following persons…"</p></blockquote>
were perfectly adequate for the coming into operation of these provisions. Under paragraph (	<i>a</i>) the person who succeeds or seeks to succeed the tenant of a holding will have to have three months before he makes his application but I cannot understand, particularly in view of what the Government have said this morning why they have to give three months from 1st January 1977.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
