	<p>That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain. I have had an opportunity since our last Sitting to study very carefully the amendments tabled to Clauses 13 and 14, which concern matters of Scottish law. There ought to be a Scottish Law Officer with us when we are considering these matters. We require a specialist on Scottish law to present these complicated matters to the Committee. I think I am right in saying that Law Officers are permitted to attend Committees, and it would seem reasonable that the Lord Advocate should be summoned. If we do not reach Clauses 13 and 14 today perhaps he could be given notice that we hope he will be able to be present at our Sitting on Thursday morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt the Minister will take note of what the hon. Gentleman says. I have no power to insist that the Lord Advocate comes to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we last met I had just started a preliminary description of the purposes of the clause. As the matter may have faded in hon. Members' minds, I am tempted to go over the ground again, but my remarks are on record and I shall continue from where I left off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had described the matter in an evenhanded manner and taken no strong viewpoint one way or the other on the clause. But the time has now come when
	<span class='label label-info column'>600</span>
we should question the motives behind the Government's inclusion of the clause in the Bill. This clause stand part debate is the germane debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause extends the powers of an arbitrator beyond the bounds to which English law has confined arbitrators until now. An arbitrator's job is to decide as a matter of fact what must be done by a party in order to comply with his legal obligations. The clause enables the Lord Chancellor to make orders allowing single arbitrators to change the legal obligations of parties if they think they ought to, and sub-paragraph (ii) leaves it entirely to the whim of the arbitrator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Country Landowners' Association, for example, has already questioned whether this is a proper function for a single arbitrator. Although I am not a lawyer, I understand that there are other areas where arbitrators are allowed to alter contracts. I sympathise with the CLA's viewpoint. After all, a tenant enters knowingly and willingly into his tenancy agreement. But if an arbitrator can at his whim alter a legal contract that introduces a concept of law which not everyone in this country would readily accept. However, because of the precedents, I do not propose to make a substantial point of this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made it clear that a greater discretion to the arbitrator as contained in the clause is something to which the Opposition would not object. But the evidence given by the Government for the necessity for the clause is very thin. to say the least. I have reliably been told that the CLA has asked the Ministry, the National Farmers' Union, Plaid Cymru—though why it should have asked that party, I do not know—the Farmers' Union of Wales and others who have alleged harassment of tenants to produce evidence. But this evidence is extremely limited, and we are in a difficulty because we are talking about a private contract between two private individuals. It is not the iob of the House or of the Government to drag into the public light disputes concerning private individuals. Nevertheless, the clause is about just those disputes Therefore, I find it reasonable to ask the Government what evidence they have for the necessity for the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to a Written Question of mine, the Minister of State told me on 3rd February that he had evidence of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0334">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>601</span>
11 cases in England and Wales where tenant farmers had alleged harassment by their landlords through the misuse of the notice to do work procedure. I understand from the reply to another Question that some tenants did not use all the statutory procedures available to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have explained before that the law was originally written to protect both parties, to make it as fair as possible to resolve this difficult matter of a private contract by an arbitration procedure. That was without the courts of the land, and an appeal procedure could go to those courts only on matters of law. The National Farmers' Union, which, the Minister told us, has pressed for inclusion of the clause, has sent me a long confidential letter on the subject. I have checked with the NFU that certain parts of that letter can be quoted, and I think I am in order in quoting the following paragraph:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When the Ministry of Agriculture consulted the Union on this subject early last year, our County Branch Secretaries were asked to let us know of cases of alleged harassment that had come to their attention in recent years. Of the 32 County Secretaries' replies received when the Union's considered view to the Ministry was being formulated, there had been reported 12 cases of alleged harassment, although it is only fair to add that it was felt that in four cases the tenant himself was by no means blameless."</p></blockquote>
So even the NFU is claiming that it knows of only eight cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was that in England and Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The NFU is of England and Wales, but the letter does not make it clear. I imagine it would be reasonable to assume that it would be in both England and Wales. As I mentioned, we shall he coming on to Scotland in the other clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there any indication as to how many of these cases arc alleged to have occurred in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not in the letter. There is a well-publicised case in Wales which the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) mentioned in hi; speech, and of which the hon. Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Evans) made a great deal on Second Reading. I have looked into that case in great detail, and there can be no doubt that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>602</span>
tenant concerned did not use the available statutory procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am the first to want justice and fairness in these procedures. But it is ludicrous if we pass a law which allows for protection of a tenant in certain circumstances, the tenant does not use the statutory procedures available to him, and so we have to pass yet another law. It is a farcical procedure that produces four enormous tomes just touching on the subject, and results in lawyers who do nothing else but spend vast sums of landlords' and tenants' money on arguing about these things. We have got ourselves into a horrible mess in this landlord and tenant legislation. I am in serious doubt as to whether Clauses 11, 12, 13 and 14 will help, but I have made it clear that we shall allow Clause 11 through simply because there is a good argument for saying that it does not make matters worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that for some time the CLA, the NFU and the Ministry have been meeting to discuss agricultural holdings law. This is a well established and well-known procedure. I understand that all parties co-operated to produce the 1963 legislation and subsequent regulations to prevent harassment, on the strength of one case only of abuse, which was the then position. Since then the agricultural holdings law has been reviewed line by line by a consultative group consisting of people from the Ministry, representatives of the country landowners and the NFU and various representatives from the professional bodies handling the matter, such as the chartered surveyors and the Agricultural Law Association. Hundreds of proposed amendments were considered, but no allegation of harassment was made from any quarter in respect of notices to do work. The current safeguards for a tenant were considered to be more than adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, there have been difficulties, but it is thought that the existing safeguards would have been sufficient to protect the tenant if he had used them. It is easy for a bad tenant who neglects repairs to allege harassment when he is required to attend to them. The present safeguards for the tenant are elaborate. Some of the points made on Second Reading were clearly wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A landlord cannot serve a notice to do work unless the tenant is in breach
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0335">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>603</span>
of his tenancy. No notice to do work can be served within 12 months of a previous notice. The notice must be in a prescribed form which sets out the tenant's rights and remedies. No tenant can claim ignorance; they are there on the form when it is presented to him. The notice must give the tenant a reasonable time to do the work—not less than six months for any item. If a tenant's neglect is such that a long list of items has to be served, he must be given a correspondingly long time to comply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the tenant thinks the landlord has gone wrong on any aspect of the items I have enumerated he has two opportunities to challenge the notice by arbitration. He can go to arbitration on receiving the notice. Secondly, if he does not comply with the notice and in consequence receives a notice to quit, he can go to arbitration on the notice to quit. Any flaw in the notice to do work, even in respect of one of many items, will invalidate the notice to quit, which will be set aside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) is rot here. because he has said that there is a maximum figure of £500 which a landlord can for remedying his side of the bargain. There is no such limit. Under the recently revised statutory repair clauses, the landlord is made responsible for replacing fixed equipment when it is worn out. This alone can amount to a very substantial liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Section 24(1) of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948 a tenant may serve a counter-notice to a notice to quit within one month unless it is grounded on a deadly sin under Section 24(2) The dreadful phrase "notice to quit" makes reading from notes difficult, because it is a phrase of its own which is not punctuated properly. Perhaps the lawyers could note when drafting legislation in future how much easier it would be if it could be phrased slightly differently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where a counter-notice is duly served, the notice to quit will not have effect unless the Agricultural Land Tribunal consents to its operation. The Tribunal may give consent only if it is satisfied as to one of the grounds set out in Section 25, as amended by the Agricul-ture Act 1958, and even if one of the grounds is proved, the Tribunal must withhold consent,
	<span class='label label-info column'>604</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"if in all the circumstances it appears to them that a fair and reasonable landlord would not insist on possession."</p></blockquote>
That is a proviso to Section 25 made by the 1958 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 24(2) of the 1948 Act, as amended by the Act of 1958 and Section 19(6) of the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1963 sets out the deadly sins. No counter-notice may be served to a notice to quit grounded on a deadly sin. The notice to quit, if valid, operates automatically, but the tenant may go to arbitration on the validity of notices served under subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>), (	<i>d</i>) and (	<i>e</i>), because the land is required for permitted development, because of the tenant's failure to comply with a notice to pay overdue rent, or where the notice is to remedy breaches of tenancy or the tenant is committing an irremediable breach of tenancy. These matters sound complicated, but I think that they are well known. I know full well that if I do not pay my rent my landlord will give me notice to quit that will stick. If the landlord requires my farm for building land, likewise he can give me a valid notice to quit. That is well known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is nice to find the phrase "deadly sin" being used, and I commend the lawyers on this occasion. The phrase is not in the Act but the lawyers have used it, and it is well understood. It is also clear that there is a list of breaches which, if given to a tenant, will lead to his being given notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Section 24(2)(	<i>d</i>) it is deadly sin to fail to comply
	<br><blockquote><p>"within such reasonable period as was specified in the notice to remedy any breach by the tenant that was capable of being remedied of any term or condition of his tenancy which was not inconsistent with the fulfilment of his responsibilities to farm in accordance with the rules of good husbandry".</p></blockquote>
As regards this deadly sin, the law was elaborated for the protection of the tenant by Section 19 of the Agricultural (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1963 and an Order and Regulations made in 1964—The Agriculture (Notices to Remedy and Notices to Quit) Order 1964 and the Agriculture (forms of Notices to Remedy Regulations) 1964, Statutory Instruments 706 and 707 of 1964, which will be well known to the legal fraternity. All interested bodies agreed that this elabora-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0336">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>605</span>
tion of the procedures was necessary for the protection of the tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 19(1) of the 1963 Act added three requirements. First, the notice to quit must be in a prescribed form. Secondly, a notice requiring the doing of any work of repair, maintenance or replacement cannot validly be served within 12 months of a previous work notice. Paragraph (	<i>c</i>) provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"a period of less than six months shall not be treated as a reasonable period within which to do any such work".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When my hon. Friend started talking about the three requirements, he mentioned that a notice to quit must be in a prescribed form. Did he mean the notice to remedy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I replace the word "quit" with "remedy". I should have said that a notice to remedy must be in a prescribed form, as that is what we are talking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The notice to quit would also have to be in a prescribed form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to say that, but we are talking about the notice to remedy. My hon. Friend is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 19(2) of the 1963 Act enables the Lord Chancellor to provide by order for an arbitrator to determine any question arising on a work notice; to extend the time for doing any work in the notice; to adjust the date when a notice to quit may operate if the time for doing work is extended; and to award to the tenant the cost of doing any work the arbitrator decides he was not obliged to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the 1963 Act and the 1964 regulations is to enable the tenant to settle points on a work notice, by arbitration, before he does any work. The right to go to arbitration on receiving a subsequent notice to quit for failure to comply with a work notice remains, though he may only contest his liability to do the work at the notice to remedy stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a notice to do work is invalid because it does not comply with one or more of the now elaborate rules, the tenant can have it declared invalid by an arbitrator before he does any work. There is no risk that going to arbitra-
	<span class='label label-info column'>606</span>
tion might leave the tenant short of time to do the work if he loses, because Article 6 of Statutory Instrument No. 706 of 1964 requires the arbitrator to extend the time
	<br><blockquote><p>"by such further period as he thinks fit".</p></blockquote>
The notes to the prescribed form, which must be included in the notice to remedy, set out the tenant's rights and remedies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been argued that long lists of items to remedy constitute harassment. What is the landlord to do if the tenant neglects to do his repairs, allows his farm to go into disrepair, allows his fields to become weed-infested and stops properly managing his land? Is the landlord not to serve a notice to remedy? When a farm begins to run down it does not run down in one single aspect or even two. There is a complete decline in management, the whole farm goes to pot and the landlord is required to serve a long list. Is that harassment? I suggest that it is not. However, if it is, the tenant under the existing law has a right to come back against his landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has also been argued that landlords by serving successive notices to remedy are harassing their tenants. I can only suggest that the same remarks apply if the farm is not in a fit condition and does not comply with the tenancy agreement 12 months after the last notice to remedy was served. Is that unreasonable? Is it not fair that the landlord should serve a notice to remedy? As I have explained in some detail, the tenant now has a statutory right to deal with the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A recent case in the House of Lords—Wykes 	<i>v.</i> Davis. in 1974—made clear that a correspondingly long time must be given to comply with long lists of notices of items to remedy. The length of the list is a measure of the tenant's neglect, because each item must be a breach of tenancy, in which the tenant's failure is—I quote from Section 24(2)(d) of the 1948 Act—
	<br><blockquote><p>"inconsistent with the fulfilment of his responsibilities to farm in accordance with the rules of good husbandry".</p></blockquote>
That explanation of the pros and cons of this matter should be taken in the light of two other matters. First, as I have said, I find it difficult to get evidence. I wrote to the Farmers' Union of Wales on 26th January and have not yet had a reply. Therefore, its allegations will have to go in default—perhaps
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0337">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>607</span>
through the failure of the postal services. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors wrote a letter to me dated 12th December, and signed by Mr. R. W. Baker, Secretary for Public Affairs. I am sure that the Minister will accept that The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has no stand on this matter other than that of completely independent arbitrators. Some of his hon. Friends have been claiming that interested parties have been briefing the Opposition. The letter says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Members of the Institution have not been aware that the harassment problem is serious enough to warrant legislative action. However, if the Government feels that it is necessary to introduce further safeguards at this time, it is considered that Clause 11 adequately covers the situation."</p></blockquote>
The Institution repeats the point I have been making, that there is no great case for this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman read the second sentence again? Did it say that Clause 11 adequately covered the situation? If so, why this long tirade against it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman thinks I am opposed to the clause he has not been listening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening very carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been explaining, cogently, I hope, why it is not necessary. I am not saying I am opposed to it. I am saying that it is not necessary. Do we want to fill the Statute Book with unnecessary legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said that Clause 11 was satisfactory. Is that not what the hon. Gentleman quoted it as saying?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might help if I read again part of the letter dated 12th December from the Institution, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Members of the Institution have not been aware that the harassment problem is serious enough to warrant legislative action. However, if the Government feels that it is necessary to introduce further safeguards at this time, it is considered that Clause 11 adequately covers the situation."</p></blockquote>
That is precisely the point I have been arguing. I am using that comment to strengthen my case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The totally independent Royal Institu-
	<span class='label label-info column'>608</span>
tion of Chartered Surveyors, with no special interest except an interest in the administration of justice and briefer and better legislation, has advised that it sees no reason for legislation but that if the Government press the clause it has no objection to it. That is the point I was making. I have told the Committee several times that I do not intend to vote against the clause. But it is only right that we should waste an hour or two in Committee to save many hundreds of hours of arbitration in lawyers' rooms throughout the land for goodness knows how many years. That is why we are here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government cannot justify the clause they will be seen not to justify it. No doubt pressure will be put upon them from other quarters—perhaps from a legislative Committee considering whether the case for the Bill was adequately argued before it was produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After that short diversion I turn to another independent body—the Agricultural Law Association. The Chairman is Mr. P. G. Langdon-Davies, who is junior counsel to the Ministry of Agriculture and whose views have been deliberately excluded since it would put him in an impossible position. It is an important body dealing exclusively with agricultural law. Its treasurer is Mr. D. R. G. Mitchell and its secretary, Mr. Andrew Densham—who, I am glad to say, is a constituent of mine—is one of the country's leading experts and solicitors on agricultural law. I should like to give him a bigger advertisement than that, but he probably would not thank me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Association wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On behalf of the Agricultural Law Association (whose Chairman, P. G. LangdonDavies, as junior Counsel to the Ministry we have deliberately excluded from our deliberations) we should like to put forward the comments and queries which follow from our assessment of how Clauses 11 and 12 of the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and of the amendment notified on 2nd December would work out in practice"—</p></blockquote>
The amendment referred to is new Clause 1. I do not propose to refer to it again, but I am quoting the letter in full. The hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) is always taking me up for not quoting letters in full and it would not be right to disappoint him on this occasion. The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"which are made without any regard at all to any political, departmental, landlords' or tenants' point of view.</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0338">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>609</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>Clauses 11 and 12 would increase the technical and procedural complications, the time and money spent on hearings, and the delay in obtaining a final result in Section 24(2)(d) cases in what was originally a fairly simple code later described by an eminent High Court judge as ' like a game of chess in which the player who makes the wrong gambit eventually loses the game'. This will greatly disadvantage the smaller and family farmers who can ill afford the present time, money and delays, and will put anyone with greater means and better professional advice in an even stronger position than now to wear down his opposite number. A farmer may already have to go through three separate hearings (first, on notice to do work, second, on notice to quit, with a third: in time extension cases) and he may not know the final answer for a year or two, during which time he is less inclined to put as much as he otherwise would into his farming, the landlord is unable to plan ahead, and the farm inevitably deteriorates. Clause 12 would introduce a possible fourth hearing before a different tribunal."</p></blockquote>
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong to discuss Clause 12, but the letter from the Association deals with it at some length, and I hope I shall be forgiven for the reference to it when I continue to quote from the letter:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clauses 11 and 12 are a tinkering about ' with Section 24(2)(d) when what is needed is a fundamental and constructive overhaul to remove far more striking injustices than are touched by these Clauses such as:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>a</i>) Rent due on 25th March. Notice to pay on 26th. The farmer, perhaps relying on a wool or other receipt which does not come in for two months or so, does not appreciate the serious consequences of delaying payment and treats the Notice as if an ordinary rent demand; he omits to pay before 27th May."</p></blockquote>
Then he is in trouble.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Such Notices have been described by a Judge as a wolf in sheep's clothing'.
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>b</i>) The farmer commits an irremediable breach of a term.</p></blockquote>
In both these cases the farmer has to go on a Notice to Quit.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(3) Clause 11 modifies the application of a term for the purpose 	<i>only</i> of a single arbitration. The term thus modified for this occasion remains in force for all other purposes, and so a dilapidations or damages claim could include the cost of substantial work, the doing of which had previously been excused in the arbitration.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(4) A breach of a term inconsistent with good husbandry is already one on which a landlord cannot succeed under Section 24(2)(	<i>d</i>), so the reference in Clause 11(	<i>aa</i>)(i) to good husbandry seems to lack clarity. This sub-Clause also allows substitution of more expensive material or method with consequent cost which might go beyond what the Notice
	<span class='label label-info column'>610</span>
originally indicated, and which may fall either on the landlord or on the tenant."</p></blockquote>
That ends my quotation, Mr. Costain. I hope you will agree that all of the letter is wholly relevant to this debate and to the line we on this side of the Committee are taking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to take up two or three points in the letter. The High Court judge said that this matter was
	<br><blockquote><p>"like a game of chess in which the player who makes the wrong gambit eventually loses the game".</p></blockquote>
This is something which everyone accepts. Very often it is not a question of righteousness or justice, but of who has the best legal advice. That is wrong. If we are perpetuating that in anyway then we are making a great mistake. Our objective should be to see that the interpretation of the contract at arbitration should be fair, not decided on whether one day or another was the date on which money was received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a list of hair-raising cases where tenants have been evicted or landlords have been forced to keep tenants on sheer technicalities. That is not what we are amending today. We are amending something quite different. The plea to remove the great injustice has been ignored. To quote the words of the Agricultural Law Association, less its distinguished chairman, we are "tinkering about" on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we come to the question of the cost of these hearings. The Association says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This will greatly disadvantage the smaller and family farmers who can ill afford the present time money and delays."</p></blockquote>
No doubt the Minister will come up with figures quoting the cost of these arbitrations. But they are expensive and are becoming more expensive all the time. It is difficult to find out exactly what they cost. My distinguished constituent tells me that because he is so good he charges more than some. Therefore, his figures may not be reliable and I certainly could not quote them here. There are solicitors and land agents who do these things for less money than others. The fact remains, however, that—particularly if there have to be three or four hearings, which admittedly is very rare—with legal fees going as they are, cost is becoming a substantial barrier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I heard the case of a tenant the other
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0339">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>611</span>
day who was completely in the right. He had a very small farm of some 60 or 70 acres. After he had been dragged, quite legally, through the legal procedure he was finding it too expensive. We do not want to make these matters more complicated; we want to make them simpler. I shall argue passionately that there is a reason for not having Clause 12 because of the extra cost there will be to the small man.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I get on very well with my landlord. I have no fears of being taken by him to arbitration on a notice to remedy. If he served one on me, I should be nervous, not because I should lose, but because of the expense involved. Unlike what happens in a court of law it would seem that the losing party in arbitrations does not necessarily have the expenses awarded against him. Most arbitrators allow the expenses to be taken by each party at the conclusion of the case. I understand there is no strict ruling on this; each arbitrator carries out a practice according to his own experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caerwyn Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry I was not here during the first remarks the hon. Gentleman made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend did not miss very much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be grateful. in case 1 missed something. if the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not quite take the hon. Gentleman's second point. If a tenant is served a notice to remedy, of course he goes to arbitration, because that is his legal defence. It is what the law allows him to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On his first point, which is perfectly valid, in my view Clause 12 will increase the expenses because it will add another line of appeal. I shall be ruled out of order if I debate Clause 12, but I will debate it with the hon. Gentleman with the greatest vigour, and I look forward to doing so, when he can manage to be here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman mind explaining that remark?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentle-
	<span class='label label-info column'>612</span>
man was not present I referred to some of his earlier remarks. It is rather important that if he makes speeches on Second Reading he should be here in Committee to justify what he said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is wrong for hon. Members to interrupt from a seated position. Let us get back to the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to continue. In order to allow the so far relatively peaceful atmosphere of the Committee to be maintained, perhaps I could take up a point I made earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said on Second Reading that there was a maximum figure of £500 which a landlord could pay for remedying his side of the bargain. There is no such limit. Under the recently revised statutory repair clauses the landlord is made responsible for replacing fixed equipment when it is worn out. Ibis alone can be a substantial liability. I hope that when the hon. Gentleman makes his speech on clause stand part he will explain how he came to that figure and enlighten the Committee. Clearly it is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was commenting on the general view expressed in the Agricultural Law Association letter that Clauses 11 and 12 are a "tinkering about" with the law. Are we not at one? Is the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) suggesting that we should not be at one in trying to simply the agricultural landholdings legislation'? We believe that is what we should be doing. When the Minister said the other day that he did not intend the Bill to be a vehicle for a major revision of the law, we agreed. Since the Minister himself announced to the Committee a major revision of the law, we have clearly had to think again about the Bill and its purpose. T should like to see the Minister producing agreed amendments that would simplify the law and make it fairer, easier and cheaper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to line the pockets of lawyers. I apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body), for what I say, but I am glad to see that the lawyers are about to be thoroughly inspected by a Royal Commission. We can contribute towards keeping down legal costs by providing simpler laws. The agricultural land holdings law is ripe and ready, and there is no disagreement among those who are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0340">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>613</span>
practised and experienced in these matters over the points that should be simplified. Now we have put in a point that no one wants, that nobody agrees or thinks necessary, except the Government and, apparently, the National Farmers' Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is nobody?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is nobody in that it has not been able to prove its case. If the hon. Gentleman had been here he would have heard me quoting the letter in which it made it clear that at the most there were eight cases, and it cannot tell whether in those eight cases the tenants used the existing statutory replies. The hon. Gentleman was suggesting in his interruption that a tenant should not have to go to arbitration. The law of this country is, and always has been, that any citizen can put up a defence to anything which he is accused of doing. I would much have preferred this law to be sufficiently simple to be dealt with by the ordinary courts, but it is not. It is highly complex. Therefore, a special court—an arbitration—has been set up to deal with the matter. I shall probably be shot down by the lawyers for calling an arbitration a court, because it is not strictly a court, but it is a statutory way of resolving a difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to my conclusion because I feel that I have now covered this matter in some depth. I hope that the Minister can answer the questions I have asked him, because I believe that there are some substantial points. He must justify his case better than merely basing it on a request from the NFU, itself based on a number of cases, the details of which it does not know. Incidentally, it wrote to me with particulars of one case and quoted a difficulty where a tenant had been given notice on the grounds that he had only cut a hedge and not cut and laid it. I took advice on that. I understand that the phraseology in the standard tenant's agreement has since been altered. Of course, if the requirement was to cut and lay, the tenant should have cut and laid. It was a contractual obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the comment from the other side of the Committee seems to imply that all landlords are bad and all tenants are good. We know that that is not true.
	<span class='label label-info column'>614</span>
There are many bad tenants and many good landlords.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the hon. Gentleman's priority that is interesting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman objects to my priority, I shall be glad to reverse it at any time. What is important is that we get justice. We get justice in two ways—first, by writing simple and easily understood laws; secondly, by making sure that any disagreement upon those laws can be simply and easily administered. Neither applies to landlord and tenant legislation. The time has come for a major revision. The whole matter should be looked at. I am sorry that my own party when in Government did not take the opportunity of doing just this, but that is history now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe this is a matter of Party difference. I fail to understand the attitude of hon. Members from Wales and Scotland who keep exacerbating this position. We have no difficulty in administering this in my part of the countryside, either where I live or in my constituency. There is a working relationship which should be improved upon, and not used to stir up petty political arguments, which is what is happening. It is sad, because in the countryside we do not like that sort of thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Though I shall not urge my hon. Friends to vote against the clause, because I believe that it carries out the intention, Iask the Government to justify their intention and to tell the Committee why it has been necessary to add yet more complexity to this complex subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ishall be brief, because the speech which has just ended, which lasted 70 minutes, including last week, merits no more than a brief comment. First, we have been told that the basic problem is that a complete rejigging of the Agricultural Holdings Act is needed. Many of us would agree, but there is a remedy, which is to put down an amendment to bring about the elements of justice which the hon. Gentleman thinks are missing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:That is the Government's job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Gentleman says that these things do not matter anyway. It is the first time I have ever heard
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0341">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>615</span>
a 70-minute speech about a clause which apparently the Opposition do not oppose. Joan of Arc was put to the water torture, and after water had been poured into her for several hours she said "All this vast amount of water for little me!" It is rather the same here. If the hon. Gentleman does not find the clause so objectionable, if he approves of it, as he says, why does his speech denigrate it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the amendments are minor amendments, as everyone accepts. They are not turning upside down the Agricultural Holdings Act; they are doing exactly what the hon. Gentleman says should be done. The burden of his case was that the clause brings further legalities into situations which require not legal decisions, but fairness—not legal niceties but justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But that is precisely what the clause does. It does not introduce new legal definitions, legal niceties or legal complexities. It introduces an element of fairness. It removes the matter from the normal judicial aspect and enables a man who has been singled out because he understands the problem to say that one part of the notice is unnecessary, another part should be changed, and yet another part should be done in a different way. They are all questions of fairness, as the hon. Gentleman said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout history, when laws have been introduced to protect people, people who object to those laws have said that a burden is being placed upon poor people who will not be able to afford to go to court. But there are other remedies. The land could be removed from the squire. That would solve the problem. I am not advocating that at the moment. But it is no argument against protecting people to say that it requires the court to decide. That has been the plea of reactionaries throughout history, and we have heard it again for an hour and 10 minutes today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned the squire because of the hon. Gentleman's extraordinary remark that the clause would cause arguments between tenant and landlord, arguments which are not liked in the countryside. Some of us may have lived in the countryside longer than the hon. Gentleman—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>616</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Scotland requires justice, as do other parts of Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not have the temerity to criticise a law which essentially pertained to Scotland. The hon. Gentleman is referring to a clause which essentially pertains to England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now we have English Nationalists. I already have enough trouble on my hands with Scottish Nationalists. It would not be right for me to say what happens in Brecon and Radnor—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should go back to Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) wants to complain about land-holdings in Weston-super-Mare, good luck to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been told for the past hour and 10 minutes that we are here for justice. But we hear nonsense that we do not like this kind of thing in the countryside. It is the same as saying "We don't want politics; let us leave it all to the squire". But I do not believe that. I believe that there is a lot of politics in the countryside. Behind every hedge there are seething nests of Machiavellis in many parts of England. The purpose of the law is to introduce some justice there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what the two amendments to the 1948 Act seek to do. I support them. 1should like to introduce one change but as it would bring about complications I do not intend to go ahead with it. However, the amendments do what the hon. Gentleman said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman objected to what he regarded as Welsh and Scottish interventions. If my hon. Friend the Member for Durham (Mr. Hughes) had been here he also would have said that we speak on behalf of the ordinary small tenant farmer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where is the evidence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The evidence was in the remark of the hon. Member for Westonsuper-Mare when he said that nobody wanted this except the NFU. The NFU, he said. could refer to only eight cases. So the biggest body representing farmers apparently wanted the clause. I am taking the hon. Gentleman's evidence on this. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0342">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>617</span>
do not have any evidence myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why are there only eight cases? There are only eight because in the past we have established a framework of defence for the farmer in most cases. Now we are trying to improve upon this procedure. It is no argument to say that a thing should not he done because it might lead to further arguments. On the contrary, the clause seems to me to remove protracted legal and judicial arguments by leaving it to the practical common sense of a man who knows the countryside. The Opposition told us "That's the way we do things in the country. We leave it in this way". I am now following the hon. Gentleman's argument. Let the decision be left to the arbitrator. All that we are saying is that we do not intend to leave it to the squire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the Opposition are willing to wound and afraid to strike. All their arguments have been in defence of the landlord, as opposed to the farmer, but each time they claim to be even-handed. That is not true. Every time we point it out we are accused of stirring things up. It is they who are doing that. Even in their order of priorities, they talk of good landlords and had tenant farmers. The hon. Gentleman could not remember the reverse of that. This is a curious order of priorities for the hon. Gentleman, especially since he has declared his interest as a tenant farmer. He is a renegade as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is totally distorting what I said. He knows perfectly well that T merely spoke of the hon. Members from Scotland and Wales because we have the misfortune to have him and his hon. Friend from Wales on the Committee. I have no doubt that there arc other hon. Gentlemen who would just as much wish to stir up these matters for their own political ends. That is my comment, and the hon. Gentleman is perfectly right to take me up on that and to answer it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But as for the question of the countryside, how can the hon. Gentleman argue that I was putting the viewpoint of the landlords when I quoted two totally independent bodies—the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the Agricultural Law Association—which were in agreement and the line of both of which I have faithfully followed throughout my
	<span class='label label-info column'>618</span>
remarks, however long they may have taken?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those are fair points. When we analysed what the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said, we found that it went on However, if the Government feel it is necessary, this clause is adequate". It was saying that whilst it was not prepared to say that the clause was necessary—I agree with the hon. Gentleman there, and I think that there are reasons—these two changes were an adequate way of covering the situation. I do not regard that as a rejection of the Government's viewpoint. On the contrary, it seems to he a very interesting endorsement of the Government's viewpoint. The Government are better equipped to know the kind of cases that arise than is the RTCS. Given that the RICS is less qualified than the Government and those of us who are in touch with farmers to understand the social and other implications, the clause is adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Agricultural Law Association's argument was twofold. It said that the clause would cause complications and greatly disadvantage the small farmer. I reject that argument, which should be rejected. How does it complicate matters to say that we shall leave it to a man who understands the situation to decide whether there should be changes? How does it complicate the situation to say that it should be dealt with as a matter of common sense? How does it complicate the situation when an arbitrator says that something is not actually necessary for the farmer? How does it complicate the situation when a man says work can he done in another material? That argument is nonsense, and the hon. Gentleman knows it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was quoting on that occasion a letter from the Agricultural Law Association. I have the highest regard for the hon. Gentleman's experience as an ex-Minister in the Ministry of Agriculture. Of course he is right to think of that august body as being all-knowing and all-seeing, but he cannot argue that people who operate this law day in, day out, at all levels on behalf of all parties, do not know what they are talking about. Of course they know and, with respect, I suggest that they know a great deal better than anybody on either side of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0343">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>619</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that. I am saying that the Government have to go further than that, as back-bench Members on this Committee need to go further. I am saying that there are other problems involved. There are social problems involved. There are the problems of general justice beside legal justice. That is the problem the Government have to express and that, with respect, is something we understand a great deal better than the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, because it is not its function so to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Agricultural Law Association put forward the problem of complications, and its second point was that it would greatly disadvantage the small farmers. That is a curious argument. A practical, sensible, common sense, non-judicial set of amendments to the clause in order to assist small farmers is seen in some way as disadvantaging small farmers. Only if the review of the arbitrator is challenged, and only if the landlord is not prepared to accept that certain things in the view of a good independent judge are not necessary, will small farmers be disadvantaged. It is not the amendments that will do it. It is those who wish to invoke all the paraphernalia of law and further appeals who will do it. That is what will disadvantage the small farmer and, with respect, that is basically the problem when all the verbiage is torn aside and it is this aspect and this argument alone upon which the hon. Gentleman rests his case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is regaling us with the not unfamiliar arguments which amount to the old phrase, which has caused so much trouble over the years, that the Labour Party's view is that the gentleman in Whitehall knows best. I think he is doing that again. Although we are accustomed to the hon. Gentleman's know-all attitude on everything on which he speaks, if I can put it in a friendly way, may I refer him to a part of the letter from the Agricultural Law Association from which my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) quoted. I shall read part of it again:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clauses 11 and 12 would increase the technical and procedural complications, the time and money spent on hearings, and the delay in obtaining a final result in section 24(2)(	<i>d</i>) cases in what was originally a fairl simple code …"</p></blockquote>

We support Clause 11, not because the gentleman in Whitehall knows best, but because the tenant farmer, the NFU and those of us who are in touch with people who have been subject to harassment know best—with respect, a great deal better than the chartered surveyor, the hon.

accused me of being an English nationalist, but I repeat that I would not have the temerity to go north of the border and start criticising, however, odd or curious I thought them, the laws pertaining to crofting, fr instance. This is why those of us who sit for the English constituencies become incensed. Again and again we have laws foisted on us which stem from Left-wing members of the Labour Party who sit on the Celtic fringe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand why the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) was unable to be with us earlier this morning and sympathise with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) made a most interesting and full speech. quoting from a letter he had received from the NFU concerning the number of cases involved in the situations we are talking about in Clause 11. Tt turned out that there had been eight referred to that body in the last two years; I think I am quoting the figure correctly. I suggest that most of the eight cases emanated from the Principality. I am thinking particularly of one case that has already been referred to in the course of the Committee proceedings. You, Mr. Cos-tain, have ruled that we can talk about it even though it is 	<i>sub judice.</i> If my information is correct, in that case the tenant did not use the procedure available to him to right what he thought was his wrong. That. I understand, will be the basis of the legal proceedings; we cannot go further than that this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to support what my hon. Friend said. The purport of what he was saying was that this clause is unnecessary and further complicates the law as it stands as far as the landlord and tenant are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Renfrewshire. West made the point that it was not unnecessary; there was the burden of case history. The onus is on the Government to produce the evidence, which none of us has had from any source whatsoever, as to why the law should he changed. I confess that T take a rather stronger line than does my hon. Friend. Although in practice I think he is right that this clause is unnecessary, the main point about it is that it further breaks down the law of contract. I am not a lawyer, but over and over again recently
	<span class='label label-info column'>622</span>
we have had legislation passed through the House which invalidates a contract freely entered into between two individuals. The major one emanated, again, from Wales; I refer to the Leasehold Enfranchisement Act, which was passed through Parliament and remains the law of this country. I appreciate that there was a difficulty in Wales, but to right that wrong the entire law was changed covering the whole of the British Isles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same is happening here. I have been connected with agriculture all my life. I have served on a smallholdings committee, as I have already said, and have been a Member of Parliament and a candidate for nine years. I have had only one case of harassment, which involved the local authority as landlord. I accept that such cases may be hidden and we do not know of them. The hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West said that we did not know; he had had information that made him think that throughout England there were people hiding behind hedges in fear, not willing to come forward. I question whether there is any substance in that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even if the hon. Gentleman were to accept the question of harassment, let us leave it aside for the moment. What are the specific objections to this freedom being given to the arbitrator? Common sense says that the law should be changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not listened to what I was saying; I am afraid that I probably did not make it clear. It is altering the contract which has been made freely between two individuals. The contract has not been made under duress; it has been freely entered into. T am not a lawyer, but this is a point of law which has always seemed to me to be sacrosanct. Once it is changed, one can never be certain in future as a party to these operations whether one is doing something that will stand up in law, not only as regards the individual and the other party, but as regards the individual's successors and those of the other party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to be out of order and verge on what we may be discussing later—the Minister's new clause—but this matter will come up there. Essentially we are talking about the law of contract. As I say, T become angrier
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0345">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>623</span>
on this than does my hon. Friend. In practice it is unnecessary, because I do not believe that these instances arise in any large numbers; and hard cases, as we have already said, make bad law. The significant point is that it is a further nail in the coffin of the law of contract, which is very dangerous for all parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) referred to the fact that only eight cases of harassment were known. Assuming that there are no more than eight, is he opposed to legislating to protect them, if there is a need to protect them? If one person is aggrieved, we should be trying to do something about it. I take no note of the number concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the law of leasehold enfranchisement as an interference with contract and said that this clause would likewise be an interference with a contract. He seems to have raised the idea of contract above all other considerations. Is he saying that he is opposed to arbitration of any kind? That is how he seemed to be arguing. He seemed to be arguing against the present situation, saying that it would interfere with the contract. If that is the case, he must say so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like Members of the Opposition to spell out how they feel that this new clause will interfere with the present smooth running of operations in their part of the world. They accuse us of being wild, woolly men from Scotland and Wales. The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) almost implied that we had no right to be on this Committee. I must tell him that the Bill applies as much in Wales as in his part of the country; we have every right to be involved in it. We must look carefully at his votes on Scottish affairs in future and see what he is doing interfering in those matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first say that I understand that the hon. Gentleman was unable to be with us earlier for purely domestic reasons. I cast some aspersions on his absence, for which I offer my wholehearted apology. I understand that it was a personal matter and I am extremely sorry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I say that my comments on the hon. Gentleman's constituency were really following those of my hon. Friend, who said it was the extreme Left-
	<span class='label label-info column'>624</span>
wing of the Labour Party from the Celtic fringes and their influence on the Government of the day about which he was complaining. It has nothing to do with Scotland and Wales, because in due course we shall be discussing an exactly similar point dealing with Scotland. I shall not stop myself from commenting on those clauses, unhappily for the Committee. The hon. Gentleman must not get this matter wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am becoming used in this Committee to the peculiar views emanating from the hon. Gentleman. May I say that I entirely accept his apology; Iunderstand that he was not in full knowledge of the facts. I heard sufficient of his speeches, at our previous sitting and today, to get the general burden of his remarks. He is fond, as many of his colleagues are, of describing any legislation which he does not much favour, as coming from the extreme Left wing of the Labour Party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not noticed that many of the tenant farmers in my constituency are militant Left-wing political persons. They are people who are anxious to see justice and to have justice. I cannot see a revolution coming about as a result of this clause. I am sure my hon. Friend the Minister would be terrified if he thought he was starting a revolution with the Bill. We have acknowledged that there is a need for arbitration, unfortunately. The vast majority of cases do not go to arbitration, thank goodness. I should like to see the day when we do not need it at all, when we can settle any differences without having recourse to this procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred on Second Reading to various cases which he knew personally had resulted in great hardship. Before he sits down, would he give us particulars of these cases and let us know whether the relevant notices on each side were served, and whether the harassment took place because of the service of the notices or because of the lack of service of counter notices by the tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was, in fact, coming to a particular case and I want to see if we can do something about it. This clause will not deal with the case to which I shall refer, it cannot cover it, but I hope that the Minister will take note and see if something can be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0346">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>625</span>
I cannot see how Clause 11 compels any tenant to go to arbitration. In fact. the present arrangements can still persist. As I understand it, Clause 11 attempts to give the arbitrator more discretion. I think this is quite improper. The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare went on arguing, to my mind, that arbitration is totally evil and he wonders why I agree with him. Arbitration should be unnecessary. But in this society, where agreement cannot be reached, what is his alternative to arbitration? It is a costly business and I would hope that we can assist tenants in some way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is where I come to a case which I mentioned on Second Reading. Harassment of various kinds can take place and notice can be served on a tenant to remedy certain breaches of his agreement. The tenant can prepare a defence. In preparing a defence the tenant in this particular case, to my knowledge, employed a barrister and went to a great deal of expense in doing so. But as soon as they were prepared to proceed the landlord withdrew, leaving the tenant with high costs to pick up. This did not happen once. It happened a second time to the same tenant so that he was in effect being harassed financially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause does not deal with a situation of recovering costs when a case has not gone to arbitration. So the threat of arbitration can cause a great deal of concern. I hope that we can evolve some kind of system whereby legal costs could be recovered, so that in fact preparation of cases might be assisted by some other means. This is why I wondered whether we could have Government-appointed arbitrators working full time who could act in a judicial capacity to assist landlord and tenant to come to a mutual agreement, bring the parties together without appearing to be quite so eager, thus avoiding the full system or arbitration. That is the kind of harassment I should like to see dealt with, as an addition to what is mentioned here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Weston-superMare quoted from the RICS and from the Agricultural Law Association and gave us the impression that these two bodies were against the inclusion of this clause. He said that he supported their views. If he believes that, then he must
	<span class='label label-info column'>626</span>
reject the clause—he must vote against it. He cannot say, on the one hand, that he is opposed to the clause and then, on the other hand, agree to it being included in the Bill. As I said earlier, I believe this clause aims to give the arbitrator much more discretion; if he feels the landlord is asking too much, that it is unreasonable, he must come and arbitrate—this is what arbitration is about—to try and get the two parties on to a sensible course. That I accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman do what I asked, which was to give us details of the cases, which he started to quote and talk about on Second Reading, where his constituents or people in Wales whom he knew of were in fact harassed by all these notices continually being served on them? Can he give the answer for which I asked? It is only fair that this Committee should know whether he has actually had the facts of these cases, whether counter notices were properly served, and whether the tenant took the steps which were open to him to take in those particular cases. Otherwise we are talking from a wrong premise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will recall that I did not name names on Second Reading. Another hon. Member did; I did not. I was careful not to do so and he is aware, of course, that these cases are	<i>sub judice</i>at present and it would be most unfortunate if anything was said in this Committee—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not the hon. Gentleman; I am sorry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was the hon. Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Evans). The hon. Gentleman will excuse me if I do not enter into that field, but the way is fraught with difficulties in the legal sense. I should not like to upset the legal fraternity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I daresay the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) is right in saying that there are a few bad landlords. But if I were to go to my own branch of the NFU where I live and ask whether it knew of any had landlords, T know what its answer would be. All the tenants there have only one landlord and they know perfectly well that there is a long queue to join that particular estate—an estate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0347">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>627</span>
which, incidentally, is owned by a member of this Committee. But as for my own, and perhaps greater, experience, it is that in my own constituency the largest landlord is also on this Committee but he sits on the other side, though his place is temporarily vacant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I have one distinction, it is that I represent more agricultural tenants than any one else in the House of Commons; I think the number exceeds 3,000. I can truly say, as my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) has said, that I know of no cases of complaint concerning a private landlord. He spoke of one complaint of harassment, and that concerned a county council landlord. I know of a number and they are limited almost entirely to the Ministry of Agriculture. I cannot believe that in the part of Lincolnshire that I have the honour to represent, or the part of Berkshire that I know fairly well, there are any examples of harassment whatsoever by private landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main purpose in seeking to catch your eye, Mr. Costain, was to support my hon. Friend the Member for Westonsuper-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) when he argued for a simplifications of the law on this subject. Of course he had his dig at the lawyers, but the lawyers would agree with him about this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, lawyers make very little money out of this branch of the law. It is a very small specialist group who earn a reasonable livelihood from this, but I know barristers are only too pleased to turn their backs upon this branch of the law after a few years of practising. The truth of the matter is that most of the work is conducted by country solicitors, who have a case of this kind perhaps once a year at the most. For them to have to embark upon sometimes quite detailed study of all the provisions is an onerous matter and is ill-rewarded compared with the fees they can expect from the funds at farmers' disposal. The legal profession is at one with everyone else in hoping that this branch of the law will be simplified and regrets that the Government have failed, yet again, to take an opportunity to simplify the law on this subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if I might refer to the harassment by high costs to which the hon. Gentleman referred. One cannot cover everything in such cases.
	<span class='label label-info column'>628</span>
As an arbitrator for the Ministry of Agriculture on several occasions, I complained that, having been appointed, having arranged a hearing, having booked a room, having opened a file and having written letters, the Minister then said that the parties had settled the matter and that they could not afford to pay me a penny. I thought I was harassed then. I understand what the hon. Gentleman means, but it is always wise to consult somebody knowledgeable on the subject. Whether it is necessary to go to a barrister on such a complicated case I should not like to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main point on the clause—I shall not vote against it—is that everyone connected with agriculture will, in five or 10 years' time, bitterly regret the inclusion of this clause and any other clause which mucks about with the Agricultural Holdings Act and sets up, as we have for 15 years, every professional body. With a little stirring up by the Minister it could, within eighteen months, have an agreed measure ready to put on the statute book which would simplify the whole of the agricultural holdings law, which badly needs doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe it a good idea that hon. Members from Scotland and Wales lay down the law too heavily upon England. A day will come when they may regret it. The English have been far too patient and long-suffering. The Minister said to me in the Lobby the other night that, if it had not been for so-and-so and so-and-so he would not be moving this. I sympathised with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, although I am friendly with many Scotsmen and Welshmen, I must say that I believe they are leading us by the nose into many dangerous positions. I believe everyone will regret alterations to the Agricultural Holdings Act being shoved into this Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) made such a good case that if, in another reincarnation, Ihave enough brains and I am blessed with enough money to take a farm, should I have a dispute with my landlord I should like to employ my hon. Friend as an arbitrator. With his knowledge he will undoubtedly, in his reincarnation, take my place as an arbitrator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support my hon. Friend's attitude, but I am worried about the extra notices that will have to be served. A tenant, in the middle of harvest or sugar-beet
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0348">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>629</span>
lifting, or at drilling time—or even, sometimes, during a holiday—receives a notice which he leaves on one side behind the clock on the mantelpiece, as often happens with small farmers. He produces that notice to his valuer a week out of date. That actually happens and I have known people leave their holdings because of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not arguing for longer notices, but if the law is complicated with more notices and if it is altered without looking at the remaining part of the Agricultural Holdings Act and without seeing that it all cogs in with it, which this will not, it will lead to tenants losing their cases and their holdings because, even if the tenant notifies his solicitor or valuer in time, a month goes by like a flash.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my firm we have increased our professional indemnity to over £250,000. When I first joined the firm it was £5,000. That is because of the complication of various laws brought into our lives. We have to insure against so many things which might, through missing a notice, lose a tenant his livelihood and thereby bring a heavy claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would support a radical revision of the Agricultural Holdings Act, and it is time that this was done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister, who is to answer the debate, said on 12th February:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… we have had a great deal of help from the association of which the hon. Gentleman is a member, the Central Association of Agricultural Valuers. We consulted the Association on the amendments and its advice was invaluable. The Association strongly supports both Clauses 11 and 12."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee</i> C; 12th February 1976, 	<i>c.</i> 552–53.]</p></blockquote>
I am very surprised that the Association is at variance with the RICS, because practically every member of the CAAV is a member of the RICS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After a telephone call from a member of the CAAV I had a letter this morning from Mr. Atkinson of Messrs. Dee and Atkinson of Driffield in East Yorkshire. It appears that the Ministry has been putting some pressure on him to write to me. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Ministry of Agriculture wish it to be made known to you that members of the Central Association of Agricultural Valuers have been invited to express their views in relation to Sections 11 and 12 of the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and that their recommendations were generally
	<span class='label label-info column'>630</span>
accepted, in particular with regard to Section 11(aa)(i).</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>My colleagues consider that the arbitrator is the proper authority to consider whether any item specified in the notice is ' unnecessary or unjustified ' and that it would be a serious and retrograde step involving unnecessary delay and expense to have to refer to the Agricultural Land Tribunal at any stage of the proceedings."</p></blockquote>
It seems to me, although I was unable to get Mr. Atkinson on the telephone, that this would be against Clause 12. We have not yet reached Clause 12, but hope that by that time we do we may clarify this matter. It does not seem to be the same as what the Minister said to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), who unfortunately is not here, lays down the law as if he is the only person who knows the social problems on the worldly side. That is a bit of real arrogance. From the age of five or six years I was brought up surrounded by friends who were tenant farmers. I worked in a market, driving bullocks and sheep. I was brought up among agricultural workers on farms. Surrounding my home, where I was born and where I now live, are hundreds of small tenant farmers with under 100 acres in the Fens of Southey, Hilgay and Stowbridge, just over the river from my house. I was on the smallholdings committee of the Norfolk County Council for 21 years, and working as a chartered surveyor—or as an auctioneer, it does not matter what it is called—in country practice I reckon one gets to know both sides of the social aspects of the countryside almost better than anyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say this with all sincerity: I lived through "the thirties" and I did not like that period. It was a horrifying time in our part of the world just as much as in any other with thousands and thousands of acres put down to grass, men thrown out of work, and so on. If one did not learn the social worries of that time, and from then onwards, certainly one's eyes must have been closed. My eyes were not closed. It is arrogant for anyone to assume that because one is a Conservative one does not know what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the weekend I was rung up by my branch of the NFU. It opposed the Derbyshire resolution at the annual general meeting with regard to succes-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0349">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>631</span>
sion of tenancies. In fact, in our part of the world they are—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is going very wide now. We are debating "Clause 11 stand part".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have nearly finished now, Mr. Costain. I am sorry that I became worked up over what the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) said. I can assure him that I know far more tenants than I do landlords in my part of the world. I believe that this clause will do the tenants particular harm because they are the people who have to seek advice on the notices. I believe it is wrong to revise the agricultural holdings law piecemeal through the Agricultural (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, and for that reason I wish that we were considering a complete revision of the whole of the Agricultural Holdings Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Gavin Strang)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 11 provides greater security of tenure for tenant farmers in England and Wales. Let us not forget that—it is what the clause is about. It corrects an undesirable imbalance in the existing legislation which enables a landlord, even though acting within the law, to harass his tenant into quitting his holding prematurely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause enables additional powers to be conferred on an arbitrator. These will give him discretion, which he currently lacks, to modify a notice to do work. He will be empowered to delete from a notice any item or part of an item which he considers to be unnecessary or unjustified in the interest of good husbandry of the holding to which the notice relates, or sound management of the estate of which the holding forms part, or to substitute a different method or material from any that is required by the notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) is not with us, because he wanted to go through in simple terms the actual procedure that takes place with regard to the implementation of these notices. I shall not go into the details which I might otherwise have done had the hon. Member been here, but I should like to say a few words on the procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the tenant wishes to dispute any
	<span class='label label-info column'>632</span>
question which arises under a notice to do work, for example, his liability for any of the individual items listed, he is empowered to serve on his landlord in writing within one month a counter-notice requiring the question to be referred to arbitration. The arbitrator may be appointed by agreement or by the Minister if the parties cannot agree. He will require both the landlord and the tenant to give him a statement of their respective cases within 28 days and will confine his arbitration to the matters that are disputed by the tenant. He will conduct the hearing using normal judicial procedure and may cross-examine both the landlord and the tenant or their witnesses on oath or on affirmation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are private hearings and either party or the arbitrator may object to the presence of strangers. A site inspection will normally be carried out and the arbitrator will delete from the notice any items that he is satisfied are not the tenant's liability to maintain or repair. In giving his award he is required to extend the period of time allowed in the notice by the time taken for the arbitration and any further time that he might deem to be necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the Minister say that the arbitrator would delete from the notice anything which he considered was not the "liability" of the tenant? Did the hon. Gentleman say "liability"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but sometimes it is difficult to hear the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I thought this was a routine matter and I simply wanted to get it on the record. I can assure the hon. Member that the arbitrator can obviously delete from the list items which do not need to be repaired under the terms of the tenancy agreement. That was the justification for the use of the word "liability".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I can come quickly to the points which have been made in relation to complaints. Complaints of harassment of tenants by landlords have arisen from time to time. They have all alleged the misuse of the notice to do work procedure in which the landlords were said to be serving unreasonably long lists of repair on their tenants and using
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0350">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>633</span>
noncompliance as a ground for taking possession. In 1960, for example, NFU inquiries showed that such abuses were undoubtedly occurring, although confined to a small minority of landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of discussions which took place between the Ministry, the Country Landowners- Association and the National Farmers' Union full agreement was eventually reached on a revised set of proposals which formed the basis of what is now Section 19 of the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1963. The provisions of this section are, briefly, that the notice to remedy had to he in a prescribed form; the time allowed for compliance should be not less than six months; an order might be made providing that the tenant would be able to demand arbitration on the notice, and the arbitrator would extend the time allowed for completeion of the work by the time taken by the arbitration plus any further time which he felt to be necessary. Unfortunately, subsequent events have shown that these changes did not go far enough.

The recent complaints came mainly from South-East Wales. These complaints still followed the same pattern as those of the early 1960s, namely, that of tenants being served with unreasonably long lists of work to be done. In several cases the tenants referred the matters to arbitration. I want to emphasise that point. It is the case, of course, that some tenants did not take full advantage of the legal procedures open to them. But it is also the case that some did and it is certainly not true, as the hon. Member has sought to imply, that tenants have invariably not taken advantage of the statutory procedures available to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the point. The point is—how many did and how many did not, and of those who did, with what success did they meet? The Minister has exposed himself to my question and he is now on charge to reply to it very precisely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman will perhaps regret that he was not here for his hon. Friend's speech to hear the point that he was arguing. He was arguing, as, too, was the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon), that invariably tenants did not
	<span class='label label-info column'>634</span>
take advantage of the statutory procedures available to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may well be wrong in using the word "invariably", and I have no doubt that he is prepared to bow his head and stand corrected. The Minister says that in some cases arbitration was sought. May we know the proportion and the results?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously we are talking about very few cases. My guess would be, and it is a guess, based on the cases I have seen—obviously we are not going into the details of individual cases here—that about a third referred their cases to arbitration. It may be higher. But we must he careful about this. The fact is that there is agreement among a considerable number of people that, under the existing legislation, the arbitrator does not have sufficient scope to amend the notice to do work. That is what is at issue here and I refute strongly any contrary suggestions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Eight in two years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our discussion is taking on the appearance of an Agatha Christie plot where the information does not fit in. I understand the Minister's difficulty. But we are intrigued to hear of these three or four cases. We are now getting down to hard figures, because if it is a third of the sort of number the Minister is talking about it will be three or four—it does not matter if it is one, or six. What we cannot understand, if the proper procedures were carried through on both sides, is how it is possible for harassment to occur, because the tenant already has statutory defences. The Minister really must take the cloak off at least one case to show us how such a situation is possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would invite my hon. Friend to clarify the position. Are not the members of the Opposition arguing on Clause 12 rather than on Clause 11?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If they were, I would rule them out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can spend a lot of time on this. The basic argument between us is this. We take the view that the balance here should be adjusted to give the tenant greater protection. I ask to be given a chance to develop these points. It is a little hypocritical to attack this

	<span class='label label-info column'>635</span>
view and to make comments such as those made by the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins), that everyone connected with agriculture will come to regret bitterly these clauses, and that they will damage the tenants. Why is not the hon. Gentleman voting against them? I shall leave hon. Members to ponder on the contradictory motives of hon. Members opposite. They can launch bitter attacks against these clauses but are not prepared to vote against them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will get on to 364-day tenancies by the time he has read that brief and find out how many have been countenanced by his Ministry in defiance of the 1948 Act and its basic principles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Member that I would be very happy to receive any information he has on that. I certainly agree that one thing we want to ensure is that the Ministry of Agriculture is a model landlord and I would appreciate any help hon. Members can give me in ensuring that that is consistently so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In defiance of the Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we can return to the clause at issue. It must be emphasised that only the tenant's side of the various stories has been heard. Nevertheless, there is sufficient similarity between the various complaints received to show beyond reasonable doubt that there were matters here to cause concern. Many of the allegations were repeated in the Press and on television. It may be significant that, with only one exception, the landlords or their agents have remained silent. The inference to be drawn, therefore. is that unreasonable use was being made of the notice to do work procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of these complaints the Ministry consulted the representatives of the agricultural industry and the interested professional bodies. The NFU reported that cases of harassment do occur from time to time but there was no real evidence that it is a widespread or frequently encountered problem. This is accepted by the Ministry. The NFU had long considered it unfair that while a tenant can stand in jeopardy of losing his holding in this way a landlord who similarly neglects his responsibilities either gets away with it altogether or at most is made to pay if the tenant carries
	<span class='label label-info column'>636</span>
out the landlord's obligations for him. And the poorer tenant may be in no financial position to do this anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CLA said that it was anxious to support measures to stop harassment for farm tenants if it exists. However, they were most concerned to see that changes are not made which would be contrary to the interest of good husbandry and sound estate management by encouraging or protecting tenants in the neglect of their holdings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The professional bodies consulted were the RICS, CAAV, and ISVA. Four of the representatives who attended the discussions were members of the Lord Chancellor's panel of arbitrators and had been appointed by the Minister as arbitrators on a number of occasions. They had encountered harassment of tenants, though not on a wide scale, and they confirmed that the most usual method was by unreasonably long lists of work, the inclusion of expensive items, and the insistence on methods of husbandry which were no longer the custom of the district, for example the cutting and laying of hedges. These views, coming as they did from people of standing in their profession, were particularly illuminating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The conclusions to be drawn from the information available to the Ministry and the discussions that had taken place with the representatives of the industry and the professional bodies were that it was certainly possible for harassment to take place in the manner alleged because the safeguards for the tenant did not go far enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Weston-superMare (Mr. Wiggin) quoted the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors as stating that it does not think that the problem is sufficiently widespread to justify legislative action. I have to ask how widespread must it be before the RICS thinks a Labour Government should take action to prevent tenants from the threat of harassment and ultimate eviction?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A Labour Government!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This answer is one case, if it can be proved. But the hon. Gentleman has not even come before this Committee with one case. We have asked him if even anonymously he could tell us how this harassment could be carried.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0352">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>637</span>
He quotes the cutting and laying of hedges. He should know that that has already been dealt with. It does not require this clause to deal with that point. I do think it is quite wrong of the hon. Gentleman to ask me " How can that be proved?". The truth of the matter is that the onus is on him to prove that there is a necessity and we have nothing yet before us—not one case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I must respond first to the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) and explain that I said "a Labour Government" because I regard it as a Labour Government's responsibility to extend social justice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a member of the Conservative Opposition and, by token of what the hon. Gentleman has said, he is charging me with utter lack of social responsibility. I refute that and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman accepts my refutation. I wish the Minister would pull himself together and return to the contents of our discussion. He has a brief there which he is reading laboriously. I assure him now that he will not get away with it all that easily if he is so abrasive in his comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that there cannot be as much between us as hon. Members opposite allege if they are not going to vote against this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are changing our minds rapidly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am arguing is this. Harassment is not widespread. No one is suggesting that it is widespread, but we are saying that there is sufficient evidence of instances of this happening. It is surely not insignificant that the National Farmers' Union supports this. That is all we are saying. T think that hon. Members would do well not to exaggerate differences between us on this issue, because I am sure there will be many other occasions later in this Bill when there may be more serious differences between the Government's proposals and the attitude of hon. Members opposite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having dealt with the RICS point I turn now to the comment of the Agricultural Law Association. I find it strange that the Agricultural Law Association or
	<span class='label label-info column'>638</span>
any other organisation can regard it as being to the disadvantage of small family farmers to give them greater protection against harassment or evictions. Of course it costs money to go to arbitration. I shall come to that point. But what we are proposing is to make it harder for the landlord to get tenants out and we are told that somehow this will be a source of hardship to the small family farmer. As my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) pointed out, we are not forcing the tenant farmer to serve a notice to refer the matter to arbitration, but we would assume that the tenant farmer would want to protect his position against the landlord in these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may make one or two points on the costs of arbitration. I think I can clarify the question of the £500 limit, to the advantage of hon. Members opposite. Under the fixed equipment regulations, if a landlord fails to execute repairs which are his liability, the tenant may execute these himself and recover the cost to a limit of £500, or a year's rent, whichever is the smaller. That is what the reference to the £500 means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards costs generally, I think the most important point is that the arbitrator takes into account the reasonableness of the two cases put forward in deciding whether to apportion costs or to charge them to one party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked that in the debate the other day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am explaining is that in a high proportion of cases the costs simply are attributed to the tenant and the landlord on the basis of what they have incurred. I am saying that the arbitrator is expected to take into account the reasonableness of the two cases in allocating the costs and in deciding whether to apportion them or to charge them to one party only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn briefly to the point raised by the hon. Member for Norfolk. South-West (Mr. Hawkins) when he referred to the situation which he had experienced, in which the arbitrator had clearly done some work but the matter was settled and he was not entitled to a fee. As understand it, the arbitrator would be within his rights if he charged the landlord and the tenant with the costs which he had reasonably incurred. I appreciate that in practice many of them do not so
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0353">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>639</span>
charge, but nevertheless he would be within his rights to do so, even where they had reached agreement before he implemented his arbitration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will pick up one or two of the points which have been made. My hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor was basically in agreement with me, and I think he is absolutely right to ask hon. Members opposite how it is they reconcile their apparent opposition to these clauses with the decision not to vote against them. I do not think there is any doubt in my hon. Friend's mind—and he has had some direct experience of this—that this change in the legislation is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the point raised by the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body), which is one which has been raised generally by hon. Members, I accept that this legislation is in need of amendment; by that, I mean a general overhaul. Both Parties have to accept their share of the responsibility in the continuing postponement of that overall amendment of this legislation. I hope that we can deal with this in the not too distant future, but regrettably there is an enormous amount of pressure on the parliamentary timetable, and that is why in this session it is not possible for us to contemplate what would be a major piece of legislation, as I think hon. Members will appreciate. It may not be very controversial, and I think it is possible that there would he an enormous consensus between us on the sort of improvements which should be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no need for me to dwell much further on this point, but I want to emphasise—and this is for the benefit of the Opposition—that there is no intention in this clause to encourage the had tenant. It is absolutely explicit in these clauses that the only terms for an arbitrator exercising his discretion in relation to deleting items from the notice to do work list are if they cannot be justified on grounds of good husbandry, or the wider considerations of amenity which we have already determined. I think that the hon. Member, on reflection, will agree that when he gave one example intended to illustrate that this was a charter for the gradual ruination of farms by tenants, he was going a little far. In fact, I would say that argument was a slight on arbitrators, though I think that was the last thing the hon. Gentleman would have wanted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>640</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think the Hon. Gentleman is interpreting my remarks quite correctly, probably because I did not make myself clear. I was saying that in the downhill slope that a tenant sometimes gets into when a farm begins to deteriorate, the landlord has no choice but to issue a long list of items to remedy. That was the point I was making, and I do not think there is any difference between us. That is a perfectly reasonable response from a reasonable landlord.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would respond in this way. There are no grounds for an arbitrator in the Act as it stands, or in this new provision, for reducing a list simply on the grounds that it is too long. This is an important point. But what he has the scope to do—I think Government hon. Members would certainly support this, if not the Opposition—is to alter the time to make it reasonable in regard to the length of the list and the actual items on it. The hon. Members interjection has simply served to confirm my basic point, which is that there is absolutely nothing in this new provision which should bring the slightest comfort to a tenant who is not determined to maintain his holding in a good condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will leave the matter there and commend this Clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Over many sittings of the Committee I think most of the Opposition have come to respect the intellect of the Parliamentary Secretary. He has demonstrated both his intellect and his knowledge of the agricultural industry. In the past he has been helpful to us and we have felt in general that he has understood the points we were making. But I regret to say that the reply he has just given has disappointed me. I could put it a bit stronger than that, but I do not want to heat up the mood of the Committee because that would be a pity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Could I say first that the reply he has just given has failed to answer a good many of the questions which have bothered my hon. Friends during the course of this debate. I believe it may he in the mind of the Government Whip to move a closure in the fairly near future. Mr. Costain, perhaps I could address a remark to the Minister of State, who is in charge this morning, that I believe this would be a pity. This
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0354">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>641</span>
is one of the most important and contentious matters in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quite agree that we have had a long debate, but it is a highly complicated matter. There are reasons of which most of us are aware, why this Committee is not pressed for time, which arise from a statement by the Minister two weeks ago. Therefore, I hope that on this matter we shall be allowed to have a debate which runs its full course. When we have got beyond Clause 12, the next clause, I suspect that the remainder of the Bill will not take a tremendously long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said that this is a highly important clause. My hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin), in the magnificent 	<i>tour de force</i> that he made at the last sitting and at this sitting, demonstrated a knowledge of the matters which are contained in this clause and the background legislation which covers it. We regard these changes ae extremely important. The hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) this morning seemed to be upset and all steamed up over the fact that we are having a long debate on a matter which it was not our intention to vote against. I see absolutely nothing wrong with that. These are highly important changes in agriculture, and I believe we are entitled to have a full debate on these matters even though it is not our intention to oppose and divide the Committee against them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are implications in the clause to which my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare referred which will have a dramatic effect, unless we are very careful, on the future of the landlord/tenant system. Although I suspect that there might be differing views on the Government side about the landlord/ tenant system, we must remind ourselves of the remarks which the Minister made when he said that it was firmly his intention not to damage the landlord/tenant system. For that reason we are absolutely entitled to have a full debate on these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare made the point very clearly that it is far better for us to spend an extra hour or so on this debate in this Committee and in the House, rather than create a situation whereby the courts' and the arbitrators' sessions are delayed for hours and hours,
	<span class='label label-info column'>642</span>
so that in the years ahead they curse us because we did not fully think out the implications of what was contained in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Iwonder if the hon. Gentleman would now tell us whether the Opposition are for or against the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will contain himself for a few moments. We will come to that matter although my hon. Friend has made clear what his attitude is. However, I will make my speech in my own way if the hon. Gentleman will allow me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we want, above all—I think my hon. Friend made it clear—is fairness in this matter. The Opposition do not approach this matter from the landlord's point of view or from the tenant's. We are putting it from the viewpoint of the welfare of the farm itself. That is our attitude. My hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) spoke eloquently about the fact that he had spent his life in the countryside and was aware of the mood of all types of people. He knows perfectly well what is in the interests of the countryside in general, the rural areas and the farms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcomed the Parliamentary Secretary's pledge that the Government have no desire to help the bad tenant. That is good. If it is believed that the new clause will add fairness, we will not oppose it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we have some reservations about how that fairness will be achieved. That is why the Parliamentary Secretary's reply caused so much disappointment this morning. He did not go into detail to explain why the clause is necessary in order to achieve the fairness for which I believe everyone in the Committee—in charitable terms—is looking. He did not say how many cases there have been. The Ministry must know the figures. It has given figures of occasions where this so-called harassment has occurred. The hon. Gentleman hazarded a guess that in about one-third of the cases the tenant has used the safeguards he had in serving a counter-notice to do work, but he was vague about that. Will the Parliamentary Secretary give us further details? Will he tell us the cases in which the Ministry think that harassment has occurred, where
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0355">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>643</span>
a counter-notice has been served, and what the grounds for harassment were in those cases?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend said, in the case of the cut and laid hedge, it clearly could not have been that, but the Minister must know what those cases were. If he does not know, we can only charge him with introducing this legislation without properly thinking it out. I do not believe that the Department would have allowed the Minister to get into that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be clear evidence of what particular matters were in the notice to do work which the Minister regards as being unreasonable and which caused a tenant to lose his farm, because he failed, after going to arbitration, to do some of these things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said that I believe that the Committee as a whole is looking for a greater degree of fairness. However, we must have that justified in the Parliamentary Secretary's answer. I was not at all happy to hear the speech made by the hon. Member for Renfrewshire. West. It seemed to me that his political prejudices were coming to the fore in his attitude to this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman for the clause or against it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already explained our position on that matter. I had not noticed whether the hon. Gentleman was out of the room or, perhaps, writing a letter. But I thought that I had made that position absolutely clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to note that when the hon. Gentleman was talking about this matter, three times he introduced the words "the squire". It seems to me that his whole attitude to these matters is in terms of "the squire". When he brings the squire into these matters—a figure who has very little importance in rural England today—it betrays the hon. Gentleman's attitude. His preachings, that we have known for many years in this House, come more from the inspiration—if I may put it that way—of Karl Marx than from what is in the interest of the countryside. It is a familiar arrow: we have to change the law because of the squire. This seems to me to be totally unreasonable and shows the type of prejudice that comes into many of the speeches that the hon. Gentleman has made over the years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>644</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I merely used the term "the squire" to differentiate from the laird.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall come to that later. However, I thought that "the squire" mentioned three times in one speech was too much and betrayed what is at the back of the hon. Gentleman's mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that I did not want to raise the heat of the Committee, Mr. Costain. But I must return to the Parliamentary Secretary's comments. Because my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-superMare (Mr. Wiggin) has said that it was not our intention to oppose this clause, because it is held to be presented to us in the interests of fairness—which is what we all want—the Parliamentary Secretary must not use that statement by my hon. Friend as an excuse for giving us a non-answer to this debate. We must have more detail. It is all very well for the hon. Gentleman to smile. But he has given us no specific detail of how many cases and what particular issues in these matters he regards as harassment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a landlord has a bad tenant—and the Parliamentary Secretary said that there was no desire in the clause to help a bad tenant—he clearly has to serve on him a notice to do work in respect of many things. Clearly, that would not be harassment. I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that harassment by definition is only when it is done with malicious intent in relation to matters that are irrelevant. Therefore, that would not arise in those terms. However, we must know what are the issues. What is the work that is involved which a landlord could direct to be done and which the tenant would regard as harassment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend also ask whether any of these cases concern an institution and whether any are in England?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be very helpful if we could know that. We have no information at all on which to judge. Parliament becomes a travesty when we are invited to pass legislation without any evidence to justify it, apart from that supplied in the most airy and general terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we can have this information. Otherwise it makes it extremely difficult for us to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0356">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>645</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regard it as being quite invidious for me to take an individual case and discuss the details with Members in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Naturally I understand that the Minister cannot quote individual cases. My hon. Friend made that point, too. The Minister can tell us, however, what are the items of work, without telling us where or whose case it was. That would go some of the way to help us. We do not want to know where the case happened. We want to know the types of case that in the Government's mind create harassment. He has not told us that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Member is perhaps trying to be helpful, but I gather from your expression, Mr. Costain, that you do not want us to prolong discussion on the clause too long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am the servant of the Committee. We have, however, been discussing the clause for over three hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that five and a half hours is the estimate my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Scunthorpe (Mr. Ellis) has made for the debates on the amendments to the clause and the "clause stand part" discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is difficult. I have a folder here with notes on 11 cases, running from July 1973. I cannot be expected to go into details of those cases. As I see the matter, and I think it shook at least one member of the Committee, the basic and strongest argument we have is simply that the arbitrators themselves, whose opinion is respected by the Opposition, have given us firm advice to the effect that harassment can occur under existing legislation. Therefore, we feel it right to make the changes in the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors and the Agricultural Law Association have said that that is not the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well for the hon. Gentleman to say that he had a meeting at which people were present, that there are X number of cases, but no example can be put before the Committee of the kind of harassment occurring. We could have an anonymous case, for that matter, but how is it possible for harassment to take place
	<span class='label label-info column'>646</span>
under the existing law? Nobody who knows this business inside out has convinced me that there is a case for the clause. The hon. Gentleman has not started to make a case for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Member is calling into question the advice we have received from arbitrators. But I think that the hon. Member would accept this point. Each case of this nature is a highly specialised one, because it relates to the actual nature of the operation on the notice to do work. What might seem to us a plausible requirement on the notice to do work might be deemed unreasonable when the arbitrator inspects the farm in question.

The hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge, whose views are respected, and who I have come to know well on the Select Committee for Science and Technology, accused me—and I was a little disappointed to hear it—of being somewhat abrasive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that the hon. Member has heard an example of the sort of provocative speech we have had to listen to from Opposition hon. Members, he will understand why I may have appeared to be slightly more abrasive this morning when he joined us in the middle of our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it is no good the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge accusing my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) of being a Marxist, or accusing the Government of being in the grip of Left Wingers from the Celtic fringe. That is no substitute for a clear statement on whether the Opposition support the clause or oppose it. By all means let us have individual comments, but in his final speech I should have thought that the Conservative spokesman might have designed to tell us in simple terms whether the Opposition are for the clause or against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did not listen to my speech. I told him that our instinct was not to oppose the clause. That is a positive attitude provided that the Minister can give us some idea of the type of cases which justified the clause being passed into law. The hon. Gentleman has not so far attempted to do that. I submit that we have given him every opportunity to do so. Is the hon. Gentleman telling us that the Government

do not have the information? That appears to be one of the implications. I am most grateful to him for giving way to me, and I hope that he will now have some of this information which he can read out. I see that he has two pieces of paper which the Minister of State has torn out of the book of brief. If he has read through it and is satisfied that he has some of this information, perhaps we could have it. We could then all agree on this, which would be desirable indeed. As soon as I think that the Parliamentary Secretary has got this information I will gladly stop talking and sit down. I am most grateful to him for intervening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if the lion.

This clause will minimise that threat in that it will give the arbitrator discretion to reduce the work to be carried out and would in that case permit the tenant more security in going to arbitration.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is inevitable that during the debate on this clause matters that have already been referred to will come up. However, I was immensely disappointed that we had no firm argument in favour of Clause 11 and, therefore, can only assume that we shall have no firm arguments in favour of Clause 12. The difference is that in Clause 12, the professional advice, instead of being ambivalent and saying "We do not think we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0358">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>649</span>
need this, but there is no great harm in it,"makes it quite clear that it is an extra level of appeal and arbitration that will introduce a quite unnecessary stage into these complicated proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, it would be easier if we debate the amendments fairly briefly and have a debate on "clause stand part," if that is agreed to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of these three amendments, there is no doubt that the matter can he argued both ways. The National Farmers' Union takes the view that these amendments would seem to prevent a tenant from challenging by reference to arbitration a notice to quit served under Section 24(2)(d) of the 1948 Act in respect of an alleged failure to comply with a notice to do work. It is, therefore, strongly opposed to this amendment and. as has been my practice in the past, it is always fair and right that I should make that clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NFU says that a tenant might well wish to contest the validity of the reasons stated in such a notice on any of the grounds on which he can at present do so. He may, for example. wish to establish that he has complied with a notice to remedy within the appropriate reasonable time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provision is not made in the Bill for the Agricultural Land Tribunal to have jurisdiction in such matters. It is the NFU's view that it would be unprecedented and undesirable for that tribunal's jurisdiction to he enlarged in that way. To take away the tenant's present right to seek arbitration on such a notice to quit would not be consistent with the objective of the Bill of giving greater security of tenure to tenant farmers as regards any harassment by a landlord by misuse of the notice to do work procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NFU comments upon the other amendments by saying that it is opposed to the amendment on the grounds that the words in brackets in subsections (2) and (3) are to ensure that when the landlord has served a simple notice to quit, as an alternative to a notice to quit under Section 24(2)(	<i>d</i>), a counter-notice served by the tenant under the new provisions will also apply to the alternative simple notice, thus safeguarding the unwary tenant from falling into a trap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see the quite definite and deliberate comments, which makes no bones
	<span class='label label-info column'>650</span>
about the NFU's interests on behalf of the tenant. Of course it has failed in the practical matter of whether or not a tenant can afford to go on into these lengthy proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only point I would make on that is that it is interesting that the NFU, too, is querying the suitability of the Agricultural Land Tribunal. You will know, Mr. Costain, that this clause has a reference to the Agricultural Land Tribunal. There is a good deal of feeling that that body is not suitable for quite a lot of the work which it has to do at present. I hope that when we come to "clause stand part" the Minister will have something to say about the Agricultural Land Tribunal or, better still, be prepared to acknowledge that, in view of the passage of Clause 11, Clause 12 is not necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not wish to make any political gain if the Minister thought, in the interests of better justice, that he could think again. It would be a good thing if Governments were a little more humble in these matters, and that when they have propositions placed in the form of legislation unseen and largely undis-cussed, as this was, before the public in the form of a Bill, and when informed opinion clearly comes down against such a proposal, they could say that they had thought again and would be satisfied to remove the clause from the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, it must be, because of our procedure, necessary for me to argue these amendments, which seek to change these clauses which are undesirable, because they will lengthen the procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CLA takes a more militant view of Clause 12 and believes that it is so much a tenants' charter that it is now putting the imbalance into the legislation. Government supporters have said that they want everything to he fair and then they say that "fair" only means fair to the tenant. We do not say that at all; we say it must be fair to both sides. the landlord has a substantial interest in these matters, and it is not part of our job to stamp upon the landlord. Is that the Government's intention? By their legislation and taxation proposals it is consistently clear that they consider that we should he, not a property-owning democracy, but a nationalised State, which is what all these things are leading up to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not suggesting that the clause would do that or anything so dramatic,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0359">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>651</span>
but we have already had talk of land nationalisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As tabled, the amendments would omit the words in parentheses which occur twice and are surplusage. Itis understood that the words are included so that the clause would apply to "notices served in the alternative"—that is, notices to quit for a "deadly sin" which are "incontestable" but which, as a safeguard, are in effect stated in the alternative to be subject to counter-notice should they be held to be "contestable". The clause demotes the notices to which it applies so that they are to be subject to counter notice in any event. It would be pointless to serve a notice to quit in the alternative. But, even if this were not so, the words would make no difference, and so it is suggested that they would be better omitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be a good thing that HANSARD will be available before the Minister replies to my question. I apologise for the obscurity of the phraseology I have just used, but we are dealing with high legal matters and it is not easy to understand them even when they are proposed from the Opposition side of the Committee. I do not claim to be a lawyer—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Ellis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very difficult for us to understand it if the hon. Gentleman himself does not understand it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps that is why the hon. Gentleman's official capacity is confined to silence in the Whip's Office. Perhaps that is a good thing for all of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proviso to subsections (2) and (3) envisage that a defaulting tenant should be able to go to arbitration on the reason stated in the notice to quit, notwithstanding that the clause makes these notices to quit subject to counter notice, whereupon the landlord will require the consent of the Agricultural Land Tribunal before the notice to quit can operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an absurdity. It is retaining the arbitration procedure necessary where notices to quit are served for "deadly sins" under Section 24(2) of the 1948 Act—that is, notices which cannot be taken to the Agricultural Land Tribunal even
	<span class='label label-info column'>652</span>
though notices to quit under the clause are no longer to be "deadly sin" notices but notices subject to Agricultural Land Tribunal consent. That is more easy to understand. Perhaps even the hon. Gentleman, the Member for Briggs and Scunthorpe (Mr. Ellis) can understand that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This means that the tenant who wishes to contend that he has complied with the work notice, although he has not, will, together with his landlord, have the expense of two proceedings—arbitration and a Agricultural Land Tribunal hearing. It gives scope to the inefficient farmer to play for time while his holding deteriorates. Equally, it would be right to say that it gives the unscrupulous landlord to some degree more time, although in this case, because it is the tenant's option it applies less. But if it comes to the expense of arbitrations and the expense of going to these tribunals, as I believe it does in this instance, of course every cost is doubled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough for the Minister to argue, as he did previously, that this is not relevant. It is highly relevant. All those carrying out these operations day by day acknowledge that with the scale of modern legal fees and modern professional fees it is becoming a great burden for small tenants. Even the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) said that a tenant is "frightened by the threat of arbitration," but no more than anyone in business is frightened to the extent of having to carry out his contract. Ifa contract is being carried out there is no question of arbitration. It is an odd thought to be frightened by legal costs because of something one says. If nothing is said, then one is not frightened by legal costs. This can be applied right across the spectrum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The duplication proceedings, therefore, seem unnecessary, especially as the Agricultural Land Tribunal can appoint—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
