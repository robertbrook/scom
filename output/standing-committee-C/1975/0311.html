	<time>Thursday 11th March 1976</time>
	<p>[Mr. A. P. COSTAIN 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>AGRICULTURE (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILL</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain. I do not know whether you were in the House last night, but a situation arose which I had never experienced in my time in the House before. Although you have been here a little longer than I, I do not know whether you have experienced the sort of situation with which we were confronted last night—a situation whose gravity many hon. Members in the House realise and which is coming home more and more to people both inside and outside the House as a result of the vote which was taken last evening at about 10.15.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It emerged that the whole core of the Government's economic policy did not have the backing of the House of Commons. You may recall, if you were Present, that in view of the Government's failure to make a statement immediately saying what were their intentions and in view of the fact that the House had refused to back the very core of the Government's economic policy and the Prime Minister was not prepared to attend the House and tell us the Government's intention, the suggestion put forward by the Leader of the House and the decision taken by the House was that we should not move to any other business till the Government had made a statement. It was argued that the Government business which followed, although it did not have a direct influence on the Government's economic policy and concerned a draft directive which the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was about to move in connection with the substitution of dried skimmed milk Powder in animal feeding stuffs, was business which we should not proceed with in view of the decision of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that this morning it would hr quite wrong for us to consider this BM and the new clauses. We find ourselves at present in an extremely grave situation. For the first time this century a Prime Minister was not prepared to face the House of Commons when his Government had been so severely defeated. We
	<span class='label label-info column'>752</span>
were even told last night by the Father of the House that on the last occasion this happened Mr. Churchill, the then Prime Minister, came and addressed the House. At least we had a Prime Minister then who had the courage to face the House, but that is clearly not the present situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I believe that in view of our present constitutional crisis, where the Government's whole economic policy is in a state of flux and the world does not really know what the British Government's economic policy is, it would be quite wrong for us to proceed with any Government business. That is the advice which the Leader of the House gave last night and which the House accepted. Following from that it would be logical for us to carry that attitude into the Committee and to adjourn till the Prime Minister goes to the House and tells us the Government's intentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Costain, I must ask you to reject the request made by the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling). Throughout the proceedings of the Committee, every time the Opposition have found their deep-seated prejudices being challenged and they have been afraid to face the outrage there would be in the country districts if they employed their prejudices, they have produced arguments of procedure, tactics and techniques to meet the situation.—[Hon. Members: " Rubbish "]—This was illustrated on Monday when we had the extraordinary situation where a whole debate took place without the Opposition saying whether they agreed or disagreed with the basic principles. It grieves me greatly to say that this is a subterfuge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a subterfuge in order to postpone the evil day when the Opposition must face the principles in the new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal chronologically with the points which the hon. Gentleman has made. First of all. there is no constitutional crisis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Yes there is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there were a constitutional crisis the first people to be aware of it would be the Chairman's Panel, who clearly consider that there is no constitu-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0416">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>753</span>
tional crisis. The situation is not unprecedented. I have no doubt that the situation will be resolved. This is by no means the first time that a Government have been defeated, and the Conservative Party should be only too aware of that. Indeed, I remember the Conservative Government being defeated concerning the export of live animals. Incidentally, the Leader of the Opposition at that time did not make a statement on the Floor of the House, the appropriate Minister, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is scraping the barrel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is just a small local difficulty. No constitutional crisis exists. The Opposition are merely using it as another excuse to avoid facing the evil day when they must come down publicly and openly in favour of the principles in the new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the parallel—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, Mr. Costain, if the hon. Gentleman's earlier statement was appropriately in order then I wish to deal one by one with the points he made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been ruled out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not yet given a ruling on the original point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am speaking further to the point of order made by the hon. Member for Westmorland who seeks to adjourn the Committee. I am advocating a point of order in connection with why, Mr. Costain, you should not accept a month to adjourn the Committee. Indeed, I shall be putting forward a formal request that you should so rule. However, in order to do so I have to put forward precedents. Last night in the House of Commons the Leader of the House moved a suspension of the proceedings. The reason for that was not that there was a new constitutional situation. The action was taken in an attempt to help bring order to scenes of the most disgraceful disorder. Because of the disgraceful disorder we moved the suspension. There is no
	<span class='label label-info column'>754</span>
reason why the Opposition should seek a suspension today. I submit that we should proceed with the business of the day, because the whole country is hanging on the lips of the Opposition to see whether they will come down on one side or another of these new clauses or whether they will be like the mud wall and stay firmly in the middle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Costain. In the interests of clarification I take it that previous Governments have been defeated. What has been the usual procedure concerning the sitting of Committees?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was in the House last night. I realise that we are in an unusual situation. I have, not unnaturally, given the matter consideration and looked up the precedents. There is not a direct precedent. However, all the precedents that I have been able to find indicate that matters of similar magnitude have not affected the workings of Committees. This Committee is instructed by the House to proceed with the proposals set out in the Bill. We have had an Adjournment and have given generous time for the Opposition to consider the amendments. I believe that in fairness to all we should proceed. We shall know the Government's proposals better at business time this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain. You may wish to consider this point of order in connection with the point of order raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling). You have indicated that you were present in the House last night. You will recall that the Lord President of the Council, towards the end of the situation which arose after the Government lost the vote, clearly indicated in so many words that the Government did not feel that they could proceed with any further business till the Prime Minister had come to the House and presented a statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) has described the situation as a small local difficulty. All I can say is that if the defeat of the Government on the main issue facing the country—the economy and public
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0417">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>755</span>
expenditure—is just a small local issue then I must differ with the hon. Gentleman. The Leader of the House stated quite clearly that he felt the Government could not proceed with their business till they had had time to consider the situation and the Prime Minister had made a statement to the House. Therefore, I support my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland in requesting the Adjournment of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already ruled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this a new point of order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it possibly is a new point of order, but I should like your opinion as to whether that is so. You have quite rightly said that you have looked back a t the precedents. You have also said that this is an unusual occurrence. I have not been a member of the House as long as you—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do not be rude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—but in my view this is a most unusual situation. After considerable interchanges across the Floor of the House it was suggested by one of my right hon. Friends that it would be a good thing if we did not proceed with any further business. At that point the Lord President of the Council said words to the effect that that was an extremely good idea. I should have thought that as we work under the Chamber and as the Lord President expressed himself in that way, we should not proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is exactly the same point of order. I have already ruled on it. This is a Committee of the House, and it has instructions to proceed. In all the circumstances it would be a good idea if the Opposition kicked for touch and we got on with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain. There is another aspect of this matter with which none of my hon. Friends has dealt and which you have not commented on. It is an historical fact that the only power that Parliament has over the Government
	<span class='label label-info column'>756</span>
of the day is the power to deprive the Government of their money. Yesterday we debated a White Paper on the future of public expenditure the central plank in the Government's future financial plans. The White Paper was rejected by the House and we have what you rightly described as an unprecedented occasion. I submit, although we are dealing with the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which does not have vast financial implications, that, nevertheless, there are financial effects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Gavin Strang)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is none whatever in these new clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had no comment from the Government as to whether the new clauses have financial implications, but I suggest that they do have some in connection with the tribunal and the holding of public land in the name of the Minister of Agriculture. Therefore, in view of the fact that the Government do not have a mandate from Parliament to proceed with their financial plans it would, on this unprecedented occasion, be perfectly rational for you to say that in view of the financial implications you think it would be wise for the Committee to adjourn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not a point of order. I have already ruled on this matter. I think we must proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain, I understand that it is in order for any hon. Member at this stage to move a Sittings motion. As I understand it there is nothing in the rules of order against that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any hon. Member may move a Sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I move a Sittings motion I think we could get round the matter in another way. I think the Opposition would probably be agreeable to not continuing our sitting this morning, but to meeting this afternoon for two and a half hours. If I or one of my hon. Friends were to move a Sittings motion the Government might well be able to say that they would accept a motion to sit for two and a half hours
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0418">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>757</span>
for just this afternoon if we adjourned the Committee now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would seem that if the Government were to give us the undertaking that they would move the Adjournment of the Committee for this morning on the understanding that we could meet for two and a half hours this afternoon, that would get over our problem. The Government would then have recognised that it is impossible for us to continue till their intentions are clarified by the Prime Minister this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hate to disappoint the hon. Member. It might have been in order to move a Sittings motion to sit this afternoon, but he cannot move that Sittings motion this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But, Mr. Costain, if the Government were to permit the Committee to adjourn this morning—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have to tell the hon. Member that we cannot sit this afternoon because notice of such a motion has not been given. His idea, therefore, falls flat at the first post. Only the Government can move the Adjournment now, and I fear that we are just wasting time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I call upon the Minister to meet us over this point, since it is one of the most serious situations we have ever faced? You have consulted the precedents overnight, Mr. Costain, Are there any precedents for this sort of situation arising where no statement was made by the Government immediately after their defeat? Are there precedents where Committees have decided not to sit pending a statement by the Prime Minister after a major defeat of his Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The precedents show that a Standing Committee proceeds on the instructions of the House to make progress on a Bill. This is a matter for the House. The hon. Member may be lucky enough to catch Mr. Speaker's eye today and to make his point. However, we should in this Committee make progress, and I suggest in all humility that we now move on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order,
	<span class='label label-info column'>758</span>
Mr. Costain. I wholly accept what you have said and I subscribe to the theme you have enunciated. However, we are not the only Standing Committee to be considering this point. Is it not incumbent upon you to ascertain what is happening in other Standing Committees before ruling definitively in this Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For me this is the most important Committee of the House. No other Committee has adjourned, and I do beg the Committee to let us move on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All Members of the Committee have been sent brief notes on the seven clauses which together constitute what is to become Part H of the Bill, together with a summary of the family succession scheme. Furthermore, there have now been two debates on the Floor of the House in which the general
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>759</span>
principles of family succession, and the arguments for and against legislation on the subject, have been thoroughly aired. I do not believe there should be any need, therefore, to go over them once again. So I propose, with permission, to describe the provisions of each clause as we come to it, but in rather more detail than in the notes in hon. Members' possession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I start to describe the provisions of new Clause 7 perhaps I might be permitted to explain the layout of Part II very briefly. New Clause 7 is a scene setter in that it corrects a minor and only infrequently encountered anomaly in the 1948 Act. The anomaly has not mattered until now, but it is necessary to correct it in the context of the new scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Clause 8 mainly covers definitions of those persons to whom the scheme will and will not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Clauses 9, 10 and 11 are the main procedural clauses, leading up to a decision by the Agricultural Land Tribunal either that someone is to become the new tenant of the holding or that the landlord is to regain possession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Clause 12 deals with the promulgation of a decision by the tribunal that an applicant is to have a new tenancy of the holding, while new Clause 13 enables the landlord or the tenant to refer to arbitration the terms of the new tenancy agreement and/or a fresh rent if they are unable to reach agreement on one or other or both of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain. Will the Minister read his brief more slowly? This is complex stuff and we cannot understand him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am merely summarising the content. Hon. Members should have read the notes we circulated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning now to new Clause 7, as the Committee will know, under Section 24(2)(g) of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948 a landlord can serve an incontestable notice to quit the holding on the death of his tenant, when that tenant is the person who originally entered into the contract of tenancy, but as the law now stands a tenant who is not debarred from doing so can assign his tenancy to somebody else and leave the holding. The land will then be farmed by the assignee who becomes the tenant. But when the original tenant
	<span class='label label-info column'>760</span>
dies it is his death which allows the landlord to serve his notice to quit, and it is the assignee and his family who will have to quit the holding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This new clause removes this anomaly, because the provisions of the family succession scheme should clearly take etfect on the death of the assignee and not of the original tenant. Moreover, it is the close relatives of the assignee, as occupier, who should be entitled to claim to succeed when the assignee dies, and not the close relative of the original tenant when he dies.

This amendment avoids the need for elaborate special provision for what is believed to be a very small number of cases. It removes from Section 24(2)(g) the reference to the death of the tenant with whom the contract of tenancy was made, which means the original tenant, and refers instead to the death of the sole or sole surviving tenant under the contract of tenancy, which means either the original tenant or the assignee if the tenancy has been assigned. So the landlord will in future serve his notice to quit on the death of the occupier of the holding whether he be the original tenant or the assignee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reference in the new provision to the
	<br><blockquote><p>"sole (or sole surviving) tenant"</p></blockquote>
is required because of the possibility that a joint tenancy exists. In such a case the interest of a deceased joint tenant in the tenancy will vest in the remaining survivor or survivors till only one is left holding the tenancy on his own, when the provisions of the family succession scheme will apply. I should add that it is not possible for one of the joint tenants to assign his tenancy, so no confusion on this score is likely to arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of the new clause is, I think self-explanatory. It ensures that the landlord cannot serve an incontestable notice to quit on the death of a sole executor or administrator of an estate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having given that explanation of the new clause, which is fairly technical and which does not bring us to the substance of the Government's family succession scheme, I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain. I am sorry to bother you with procedural matters, but I must touch again on the situation in which the Committee finds itself. You have ruled
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0420">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>761</span>
that you will not accept a motion that the Committee should adjourn. I understand, however, that in two other Standing Committees, Standing Committee D dealing with the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill, and Standing Committee G, which is dealing with the Dock Work Regulation Bill, the Chairmen have accepted motions that the Committees should adjourn and debate is proceeding in them on that motion. I do not wish in any way to put you in a difficult situation, but since two of your colleagues have thought fit to accept such a motion are you prepared to reconsider your ruling on the matter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that the precedents are now set. You told us earlier that there was no precedent for accepting a motion of this sort, but I suggest that the situation has now changed. Are you prepared to adjourn the Committee for 10 minutes in order that you may ascertain whether what I have been told is correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the situation is that we have instructions from the House to proceed. The two Committees in question have not adjourned. They are debating whether to adjourn. This Committee has had an Adjournment which they have not. Furthermore, those Committees are dealing with matters which are, perhaps, more directly affected by the decision on the Government's policy last night. I think it would be a waste of time at this moment for me to accept a dilatory motion. In any case, I have already ruled against that. If the Committee wants to criticise my actions on that score it has a way to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think you will agree, Mr. Costain, that the fact that this Committee adjourned for two weeks has nothing whatever to do with whether we should adjourn now because of what happened last night. I do not doubt that, if the other two Committees had had a similar Adjournment, they would now be debating an Adjournment motion. That is not a relevant issue in view of the constitutional crisis facing the country in which the Government's economic policy does not have the backing of the House of Commons. I ask again whether you will accept a motion to adjourn. There is a further complication in this Com-
	<span class='label label-info column'>762</span>
mittee in that the Minister of Agriculture is not here and it would have been better if a Cabinet Minister had been here to give us some guidance on the Government's intentions. If he is in emergency Cabinet it is all the more reason that we should adjourn till we know the result of that meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have ruled that I will not accept a motion for the Adjournment. As to whether a Cabinet Minister is present, it is usual that when a Cabinet meeting is taking place the Minister concerned gives preference to the Cabinet over the Committee. There is no point in pursuing the point of a dilatory motion which I have already ruled should not be proceeded with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest once again that we get on with the business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to your ruling, Mr. Costain. I believe that a slightly new situation has arisen. It appears that when you made your previous ruling, Mr. Costain, you were not in possession of the information that other Chairmen had not quite seen eye to eye with you—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Withdraw.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) is completely out of order. I have made my ruling. In fact, what is taking place in other Committees should not be discussed in this Committee. I suggest that we get on with the business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be, Mr. Costain, that we shall hear a little later in the morning that some Committees have adjourned. In that event I fear that we shall have to ask you once again to consider the new situation that might arise. However. I do not wish to fall foul of your cool nature, and perhaps I should proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should think so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Parliamentary Secretary wants to keep interrupting in that way it may be that other tactics will have to be followed. I hope that that will not be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for telling us a little about the impact of the package. We are also grateful that the Government listened to the suggestions which were made a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0421">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>763</span>
week last Thursday during Business Questions about granting time for that debate. I think that on reflection it will be agreed that it was wise to allow the House to consider the package as a whole on the Floor of the House. If that course had not been followed it would have been technically almost impossible to have had a full, equivalent debate in Committee on the implications of the clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his opening remarks the Parliamentary Secretary gave us a few ideas and a few descriptive headings for each of the clauses in the package. I feel that if the hon. Gentleman had embarked on introducing new Clause 7 in a speech as embracing as that which was made by his right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Wales on Monday, I think that your temper, Mr. Costain, might have become even shorter. You might have been rather unhappy if he had made such a comprehensive speech on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat what I said in the House when I wound up for the Opposition following the debate on the package. I find it extraordinary that at no stage during that debate did the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food see fit to attend. I take the greatest possible exception to the right hon. Gentleman's not coming into the Chamber for a moment during the debate. I know that he had various matters to attend to concerned with the Price Review, but the debate continued for four hours. The right hon. Gentleman has been very much at the centre of this controversy. He came to the Committee early in February to tell us that he was not personally very much in favour of these provisions and that he had originally been against them. He told us that he was unhappy about them. He said that he had been steam-rollered by some of his Back Bench colleagues and forced into presenting them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the right hon. Gentleman's stated reluctance to introduce this legislation I find it extraordinary that he could not find even half an hour of his time to enable him to be present during the debate on the Floor of the House. That is deplorable. I hope that we shall have an undertaking from the right hon. Gentleman that he will
	<span class='label label-info column'>764</span>
be spending a good deal more time in this Committee. I do not recall how often he has been in the Committee since we began our deliberations in December, but I think I am right in saying that he has been here only twice. I believe that he came to talk about the changes in the law regarding agricultural mortgages. At a later stage he came to tell us that he was to introduce the new clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of one of the right hon. Gentleman's two appearances was to persuade his hon. Friends to withdraw their new clause, to substitute the new clauses and to describe his philosophy. Does my hon. Friend agree that that places all the more onus upon him to enunciate the details thereof in Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend. That is an angle that I had not previously considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should half apologise to the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan). I refused a few moments to give way to him and I inadvertently gave way to my hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton. Perhaps it is appropriate to give way to the hon. Gentleman now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case I shall be brief. I was wondering what the hon. Gentleman regarded as the most critical—namely, the absence of my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or the absence of principle on the part of the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only recently I told the hon. Gentleman in the House that he is getting more like a parrot the older he gets. That is becoming true. As we proceed with the consideration of the new clauses and amendments he will see plenty of evidence of the firm views held by my hon. Friends and myself. I expect that we shall be voting on several occasions. I hope that he will continue to be present and that he will remain alert. I hope that he will not be leading any further rebellions. It is interesting that last night he was one of those who supported the Government. I have recently accused the hon. Gentleman of being a Marxist, but I am beginning to think that he is mellowing and changing his tune.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Miss Maynard) is an old friend of mine. I notice that the hon. Lady was true to her real colours and abstained last night. She is one of those who put the Government in the serious constitutional crisis in which they find themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope it will be transmitted to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food that we expect to see him in Committee very frequently during the discussion of the new clauses. I have been taking part in Committee deliberations on agricultural measures of various sorts for almost 12 years. My hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) has also sat in Committees on agricultural matters for many years. I think he will agree that there has never been a time in recent years when the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has spent less time in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To turn to the new clause, I must take arms immediately against the opening remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary. The hon. Gentleman said that we had two debates on these matters on the Floor of the House. There was a debate last Monday at our request, but any references to these matters on Second Reading were technically out of order because there was nothing in the Bill at that stage which related to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to delay matters, but, as I understand it, such references were not out of order. I believe that on Second Reading we are allowed to deploy arguments as to why certain matters should or should not be in a Bill, provided that they relate to the main subject. Secondly, more than half the Back Benchers who spoke on Second Reading referred to the issue now before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If discussing whether a clause should be read a Second time in Committee the same procedure is followed as on Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do you mean, Mr. Costain, that we can raise anything we choose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, but we are on the Question, That the clause be read a Second time, and the same procedure
	<span class='label label-info column'>766</span>
applies as applies in the House or at Second Reading of a Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are many other matters that we should like to discuss, and we should take the opportunity to do so if we could remain within the bounds of order. Do you mean, Mr. Costain, that we can discuss any new clause that we have a mind to introduce? Perhaps I can take the opportunity to discuss the abolition of bull licences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member must not tempt me. I was saying that we must follow a similar procedure to that which is adopted on Second Reading. It is necessary to keep to the facts that apply to the new clause, but it is permissible to point out that the clause does not contain certain things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In those circumstances, Mr. Costain, the difference between you and the Parliamentary Secretary is one that I must leave to be sorted out between yourselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary described the new clause as a scene setter I think we understand what the Government are attempting to do. The hon. Gentleman says that certain anomalies have arisen in the past about notices to quit being served under Section 24(2)(g) of the Agricutural Holdings Act 1948. The section provides a list of situations in which a notice to quit has the force of law, in which there is every likelihood that the end of the tenancy will be brought about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary will be aware that we have tabled a number of amendments. Let me tell him that we do not propose to move Amendment (e).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We must complete our consideration of Second Reading before we move to the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that, Mr. Costain. I felt that I should tell the hon. Gentleman that we are not proposing to move or to vote on Amendment (e) in case he was thinking of arguments that might be deployed in resisting it. Our amendments cover the major matters about which we are concerned. I think that the remarks made by the Parliamentary Secretary on new Clause 7 were directed to the issues that we have picked up for later debate on the amendments.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0423">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>767</span>
Probably it will be better for me to reserve any further remarks to our consideration of the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You said, Mr. Costain, that we can be fairly wide-ranging in our comments on the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, within the rules of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) has said, we understand some of the Government's objectives in introducing the new clauses. However, we feel that the objectives may not produce the results that are intended. We also feel that the intention will be damaging to the vital relationship between landowner and tenant. Further, it could be damaging to the production of food for the nation, a matter which is of increasing importance, bearing in mind that the pound is sinking through the floor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many representations have been made to me by those involved with the land, such as farmers, landowners, and members of the National Farmers' Union, among other organisations. The reaction has been that while they see some justification for an improvement in the present situation they do not believe that the Bill is the appropriate instrument for implementing the change that is proposed. At the same time. they want to remove the cases of hardship that have arisen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that I received a typical reaction from a reasonable landlord who lives in my constituency. He wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What is mine is not really mine to do what I' want with. The use of my possessions is once again being restricted. On the death of a tenant I might well wish to sell a farm with vacant possession, because I wanted the proceeds for some other use."</p></blockquote>
He might want them, for example, as a means of paying his tax. If the owner resolved to sell and the deceased tenant had designated his son to succeed him, the owner would. presumably, have to sell to that son or take other action which would undoubtedly reduce the price he would receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Landowners and tenants have traditionally had a happy relationship and it has been the hallmark of our debates on this matter that these clauses are likely to spoil that relationship rather than improve it. The Government have failed to
	<span class='label label-info column'>768</span>
appreciate the stewardship concept which encourages landowners in this country, perhaps more than anywhere else in the world, to think and act in the long-term interests of the land and the community it supports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These activities are social and environmental rather than economic. Many landowners spend considerable time and money preserving the countryside for the use of the people of this country. The expenditure on this work varies according to personal inclination and what cash is available, whether from business activities or personal resources. We have heard nothing about the landowners' vision and belief in improving their heritage for their heirs and for the rest of the people of this country. This encourages them to subsidise the local community in many practical ways and to improve and maintain the countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many private landowners, though not the institutional owners, open their estates to the public. Despite the economic absurdity of this type of activity, many landowners continue it while bearing all the burdens heaped upon them by this Government more than any other. However, the last remnants of this work will cease when landowners find they have insufficient cash to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However well-intentioned the new clauses may be, they will restrict the income of landowners and prevent them from continuing to pour money into the countryside from their own resources to preserve this country's heritage for the people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We fully understand the need to deal with hardship cases and every member of the Committee would want to keep them to an absolute minimum. I have recently met many landowners with tenanted farms in my constituency and they have not once failed to give preference to a son if the tenant has indicated he wants that son to succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in grave danger of upsetting the balance that is so vital in the relationship between landowner and tenant. This is one of the reasons why I have such strong reservations about the new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is united in its objective to improve the situation, but these clauses are not in the interests of the good tenant farmer, the landowner who is a vital part of the heritage of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0424">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>769</span>
this country, agriculture, or the increased food production which is so vital to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without being disrespectful to your ruling, Mr. Costain, it is, perhaps, a pity that we did not adjourn earlier. The House could then digest what happened last night and hon. Members could return to debate these important clauses with clear minds. The Parliamentary Secretary said the new clauses were quite clear and simple. I do not believe they are. The Price Review has confused many people in agriculture, and certainly the NFU is not totally clear—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say the clauses were clear and simple. The words I used were different. I hope hon. Members read the brief we gave them. It helps to explain the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted at the Parliamentary Secretary's intervention, because when he was introducing the clauses I heard some mumblings from my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) who said he could not fathom what the hon. Gentleman was getting at. In fact, these are extremely difficult clauses with far-reaching consequences. I hope the Minister will show a little more sensitivity here than he displayed in the House when winding up Monday's important debate. There is a great deal at stake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the hon. Gentleman does not wish to upset the relationship between landowner and tenant. It is a stabilising feature of our community. I hope that it is not his intention to remove from the use of the public the vast resources which private individuals have put into the countryside over many years. I challenge the Parliamentary Secretary to come to any one of the many villages in my constituency and stop any person at random and ask how much the local squire or landowner has put into the village in resources, personality and leadership. The Parliamentary Secretary may laugh, but the leadership, money and effort they put in, with no return, is greatly appreciated by country people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the political ideology of the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), it may be his intention to erode the fine relationship between tenants and those who own the land, but
	<span class='label label-info column'>770</span>
I hope that is not the aim of the Government. If it is, they will face not only a battle in Committee and on the Floor of the House, but a fierce battle in the next General Election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain. I wonder whether you are aware that Standing Committee D, which has been meeting a little farther down the Corridor, in Room 10—I am sorry hon. Members opposite are scoffing, because this is an important matter—has suspended its sitting for half an hour so that the Chairman can consider the implications of matters which we referred to you earlier. Not only has a precedent been set in other Committees by Chairmen allowing debates to continue on motions to adjourn, but one Committee has now suspended its sitting. I reserved the right to raise this with you again. As this is happening elsewhere—and by now other Committees may also have adjourned—there is a new situation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already ruled that what goes on in other Committees has nothing to do with this Committee at this time. The hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) has not mentioned the other Committees which are carrying on as normal. I have ruled that this is not a matter on which I will accept a motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carewyn Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) spoke like a flat-earther. Because he cannot see the evidence, it does not exist. That is his attitude. He may not have come across cases in his constituency where the sons of tenants want to succeed to farms but are unable to do so, but I am having correspondence on two such cases in my constituency now. Unfortunately, they will not benefit from this legislation because they are already under notice to quit. This happens time and again, and we need legislation to assist people in this situation. This matter has been thoroughly debated. We know that the vast majority of landlords play fair, but there is a minority against whom tenants must be protected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) has just described me as a flatearther. I do not know what that means. but I will take it as a compliment. I stated
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>771</span>
clearly in my speech that I was aware that some hardship cases had arisen, but that they were very few, and that I did not believe this Bill to be the instrument for introducing a total change of the 1948 Act. It would be better to review the workings of that Act in the light of the dramatic tax changes which have occurred since then. The Committee should consider legislation to deal specifically with this matter and not have it tagged on to a miscellaneous provisions Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary or whomsoever prepared the notes on these new clauses. They were extremely helpful because, as the Minister said, this matter is not very clear. I have had experience of hardship cases, but this is not the way to deal with them. Legislation for hardship cases makes bad law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point I wish to make is that we should not mess about with the major legislation affecting agricultural holdings, make things worse for owners, tenants and their advisers and cost them considerable sums of money if they have to make representations to the Agricultural Land Tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will not take too much to heart what I am about to say. I have many Scottish friends and when I returned from Germany having been locked up with the 51st Highland Division I thought I could speak Scots, but I found I could not. It is always very difficult to understand briefs on legal matters made in English, but when they are presented with a Scottish accent they are even more difficult for an Englishman to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not necessary for me to state my interests in this clause. My pecuniary interests are wholly on the side of those who want to accept the new clauses, because chartered surveyors and solicitors and others will have far more work as a result, but owners and tenants will have to pay more in costs and fees. The matter is of interest to hon. Members who have some knowledge of how the countryside works. I fear that the harmony which we have at present may be upset by these clauses. I believe that they will lead to more litigation and discord among farmers and that food production will suffer. That is why I am doubtful about
	<span class='label label-info column'>772</span>
the wisdom of the clauses. It is the wrong place for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sometimes chastening and sometimes heartening to read what one has said before on certain matters and to read what others have said in previous years. In 1968, when the Agricultural (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill was going through Parliament, we considered the same points of principle, and hon. Members will note with interest some of the things which were said then. For instance the then Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Mr. John Mackie, who is no longer an hon. Member of the House said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It would be surprising if, after twenty years, not a single weakness had appeared in the 1948 Act. This is plainly a matter to which we should give attention in our review of agricultural holdings legislation, and I gladly undertake to do this. But it is not a situation which. as the hon. Gentleman agreed, occurs very often, and we have not thought it right to add to the complications of the Bill.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>We know that interested organisations have other points to raise on related 1948 provisions. These Points should all be considered together, and in consultation with all the professional bodies and other organisations concerned This is what we intend to do. Having given that assurance I ask the hon. member for Norfolk, South-West, not to press the Clause but to leave it to us to take the necessary stem in general agricultural holdings legislation. which I think is the right place ".— [OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee B;</i> 30th January 1968. 	<i>c.</i> 489.]</p></blockquote>
That was followed up by my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What the Joint Parliamentary Secretary has said amounts to a categorical assurance that he is absolutely opposed to any alteration to the legislation on agricultural holdings, and is tantamount to his saying that he will vote against any such provision that is introduced in this Bill ".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee B;</i> 30th January 1968, c. 490 and 491.]</p></blockquote>
The Joint Parliamentary Secretary did not vote against the provisions, but the whole tenor of his remarks eight years ago was that this sort of matter should he introduced into a revision of the agricultural holdings legislation as a whole. It is my fear that, by introducing various amendments to the background legislation, we shall cause a great deal of trouble. We are still waiting for the fulfilment of the promise that was given eight years ago. No doubt if one looked back a further five or six years one

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It happened in exactly the same way for Scotland. There were some very good speeches in that debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) might like to hear that his former colleague, Mr. Mackie, also said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Those of us who have lived in Scotland and have come to England, or vice versa, should remember that the law of Scotland is totally different from the law of England. Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing is not to be argued in Committee, but the point is that the Amendments that my hon. Friend has put down are on a fairly narrow point, about Scotland, and the legislation that thing. Our review is of the whole land tenure legislation in England and Wales.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>My hon. Friend's Amendment applies to a totally different legal system. I am not going to argue whelher it is a good thing or a bad thing. Our review is of the whole land tenure system in England and Wales, and I think that it is preferable to wait for this ".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee B:</i> 30th January 1968, 	<i>c.</i> 491.]</p></blockquote>
We are still waiting for this general review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The points I have been making are totally relevant to new Clause 7 and the various amendments tabled by the Opposition. I want a reassurance that these new clauses, particularly new Clause 7, will not put a whole lot of nuts, bolts and spanners into the delicate machinery which governs the relations between landlord and tenant. The clauses could cause much confusion, litigation and ill feeling and increase the costs of food production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To my embarrassment, on several recent occasions some of my hon. Friends have referred to my knowledge of this subject. I think that the reason for this was that they intended to push on to me the job of arguing the more ticklish points in agricultural holdings legislation. In self defence, I must say that my knowledge is very rusty and out of date. I shall, therefore, listen with great care to the Government's explanations. It would be easier if I felt that the Minister understood the briefs which are put into his hands. A brief was given the other day to the Minister of Agriculture on the Floor of the House. It was about the Agricultural Price Review. None of us understood that,
	<span class='label label-info column'>774</span>
least of all the Minister. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to explain the points which have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believed that I was an expert on the 1923 Act. I had it sent to me when I was in a prisoner of war camp and for five years I mugged it up and gave lectures on it but the first thing that the Government did when I came home was to pass the 1948 Act and my knowledge was of no use whatever. Since then we have had the 1968 Act. In the intervening years I considered that I knew something about the law of agricultural holdings. I thought I knew as much as most lawyers. One had to watch like a hawk to see that the wrong notices were not sent out. It is difficult to keep in touch. Since 1970 I have not practiced, and I now claim no special knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various professional bodies and individuals have raised certain problems and we have tried to solve them in our amendments. We hope, for the sake of the whole industry, that these points will be fully explained and, if necessary, changes made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee for not being in the Room for part of the Minister's earlier remarks. I may have missed the point he was making. This clause relates entirely to succession on death. Both I and the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) have tabled new clauses. The hon. Member's relates to succession after retirement, illness or accident and mine deals with succession by agreement. The new clauses can only be discussed at the end and if it were agreed by the Committee that the clauses, or a version of them, should be part of the Bill they would have to be reworded, because the Bill refers exclusively to succession on death. It might, perhaps, be a good idea to vary the order of the clauses so that we can discuss the other points on succession now, rather than leave them to the end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member's remarks have a bearing on new Clause 8 and probably subsequent ones, but not, strictly speaking. on new Clause 7. It might be helpful to make progress on new Clause 7. because it is not affected at all by his arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought it was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>775</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the anxieties of my hon. Friends. On this side of the Committee we are agreed that there have been cases of hardship in the constituency of the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) where some tenants have had to leave a holding where they were born and brought up and have, perhaps, looked after the farm for a number of years before the death of their father. We acknowledge that they now find themselves in difficulty. There is no doubt about the evidence concerning such people, but there are also cases of hardship on the other side. Does the Minister appreciate where the balance of hardship falls?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For every case mentioned by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor, and others who support him, there are cases of widows with small larms who let their farms when their husbands died. They hoped that their own sons, who might have been still at school, would be able to go back to the farms. Such cases are quite common. There are also widows, and perhaps executors, who have let a farm to someone who has been a farm employee who has known that farm for many years. After a period of years the widow or executor finds that that person cannot be got out. The result is that those who have been dependent on that estate—and 1 use the word " estate " in the legal sense—find themselves in financial hardship. The farm may consist of only a few acres and such people are invariably caught in the property trap. They own a farm perhaps worth between £20,000 and £40,000, so they are unable to seek any supplementary benefits, and yet they find their fixed income steadily declines in real value over the years. So one can find examples of real hardship. It is sad that people who are in that category are not members of the National Farmers' Union. It may be that their husbands were when they were alive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to clear up what he was good enough to explain earlier. He said that the Minister was not adopting a different rule for himself and went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is no exemption from this legislation for the Ministry's tenanted farms. The extension applies purely to statutory small-
	<span class='label label-info column'>776</span>
holdings ".— [OFFICIAL REPORT, 8th March 1976; Vol. 907, 	<i>c.</i> 112.]</p></blockquote>
I shall be grateful if the Minister will make the position clear in connection with those smallholdings and farms which are affected at Sutton Bridge and Holbeach. He knows that there is a very large number of such properties. I appreciate what he has said about the farms, but there are smallholdings as well, many of which comprise 10 or 15 acres.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain. Once more it is necessary to raise this matter which has frequently been mentioned during the proceedings. I waited until my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) had finished his speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was present in Room 10 when the Government moved that Standing Committee D, which is considering the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill, should adjourn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member should have been here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Joplin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That Committee has now adjourned. This is a totally new situation which does not involve you, Mr. Costain, on this occasion. The Minister of State moved the motion which was accepted by that Committee. This is a matter for the Government. There was a half-hour suspension of Standing Committee D to consider the implications of what was happening. I imagine that the Ministers then decided that it was proper, in view of what happened last night and what had been said in the Committee this morning, for the sitting to be suspended till after the Prime Minister made his statement about the Government's reaction to the great constitutional crisis which has arisen because of last night's vote. Therefore, I wonder whether this would not be the moment for us—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Ellis</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall refer to the hon. Gentleman in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that this is a good moment for the Government to move a similar motion in this Committee. I am sure that there has been sufficient time for thought and for the matter to be clearly decided and for a conclusion to be reached. This Committee should be following the same line as that taken by the Committee next door. We look to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0428">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>777</span>
the Government to move a motion to adjourn the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Costain. I suggest that this is an abuse of the procedure of parliamentary business—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[Hon. Members: Oh!]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have not ruled it an abuse. I have accepted hearing a point of order. I am waiting for the Government to make a statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They failed to do so last night.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am considering the matter which has just been put forward. I wish to make representations to the Government on the matters which the hon. Gentleman has raised in his point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not an abuse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with that matter in a slightly different context. I hope, Mr. Costain, that you will reject any suggestion to adjourn the Committee. I admired, accepted and respected the ruling which you made this morning. It is in that context that I suggested that there was an abuse, at any rate in connection with the ruling from the Chair. The candour of your ruling was that what happened in other Committees was no concern of this Committee and it could not be a precedent because it was coincidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, the argument which the hon. Gentleman adduced in asking you to look at the matter, which you had already ruled on, was of no relevance to the Committee and was based on what he imagined were the reasons put forward for the Adjournment of a Committee. With respect, we cannot rule by imagination, not even the imagination of the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling). We have no right to assume that there is any connection between what happens in another Committee and what happens in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I respectfully submit to my hon. Friend that we should resist the suggestions, because above all we know that the basic reason for the Opposition's proposals hag nothing to do with last night's little local difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>778</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Local difficulty!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition are still afraid of saying whether they are on the side of tenant farmers or landlords.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has nothing to do with a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Costain, I rise solely in response to your observation that it might be helpful for me to do so. I think that you have acted most properly throughout these proceedings. Your assessment of the relationship of our proceedings to those of any other Committee is absolutely right. I see no reason, and the Government see no reason, why we should not endeavour to make progress. I can understand the considerations which have led the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) to raise yet again this issue, notwithstanding the fact that you have already ruled on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a new point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I understand that. At the same time, I hope that, since we have now made it clear that we take a similar view to yours, Mr. Costain, notwithstanding anything that has happened anywhere else, we can now make progress on the new Clause. I hope that hon. Members will allow me to reply to some of the points they have made in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Several hon. Members 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have ruled that what happens in other Committees has no direct bearing on this Committee. I have also taken account of the fact that we are in a most unusual situation. and that, whereas it is wrong to take account of what is happening in other Committees, this is such a situation where " noises off " are bound to influence hon. Members. We are dealing with an important clause about which the public is entitled to know the views of the Committee. I thought that the debate was going extremely well. It would be a pity to break the sequence of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to what you have just said, Mr. Costain, which T entirely respect. It is the " noises off which make it so difficult to deal with these relatively minor matters. It appears to some of us that we are fiddling while

Rome burns. Till we know what is to happen we cannot apply our minds to what are really minor matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek your help, Mr. Costain. I presume that the Adjournment has been successful in the other Committee because a great deal of public expenditure is involved—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have ruled that what happens in other Committees does not affect this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain. With respect to the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) and his colleagues, I point out that I am the only Liberal here and a member of a minority party present. I voted against the Government last night, but I respect your views and your ruling this morning. As Committee Members it is our duty, if we believe in democracy, to respect the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain. There is the renowned story of a fond mother watching the troops march by and concluding that her dear son was the only one in step. One can conclude from your reasoning that you stand supreme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think chestnuts should be brought into points of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a genuine point of order. I made it in a happy way to give it some background and depth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point of substance is that we shall all be in difficulty—not merely the Chairmen of Committees but the other participants on Committees—in subscribing to rulings, if the various Chairmen of Committes later today find themselves at sixes and sevens on this issue. This is a serious point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have ruled that what happens in other Committees does not affect this Committee. There are six Committees sitting today, five of which are out of step.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Costain, you mentioned the attitude of the public to our sitting this morning. If ever there was an instance where the public might look upon Parliament as acting oddly and in a way totally without their understand-
	<span class='label label-info column'>780</span>
ing it is this one. The public, having seen the Government's major financial programme defeated on the Floor of the House then learn that nothing has happened, or there is a pause and we proceed as before. In my view it is absolutely fundamental to the whole operation of Parliament that when Parliament deprives the Government of money for their financial programme, as we did on the Floor of the House last night, the Government should pause and stop their business. Historically, this is the only control that the House has ever had over the Government. This is a major constitutional point. There are many who feel that the House has lost control of the Government's money and we should be strengthening that control all the time. Last night, with the help of other Opposition Members, we forced the Government into a position where they lost control of their money. I put it to you, Mr. Costain, that this situation is so unique and fundamental to the House that in the interests of the public, of democracy, and, above all, of the House, we should adjourn the Committee this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already ruled on this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have made a point, Mr. Costain, and obviously it is a most persuasive one. You have said that there are six Committees sitting and only one so far has sought to adjourn. However, I understand that the move which is being made in this Committee is being made in all the other Committees. It occurs to me that if we are to be the odd one out and to continue to sit when the others have decided to follow the example of Standing Committee D, we shall be rather isolated. Indeed, we would almost be an island of nonconformists. Therefore, in my submission, although what happens in Standing Committee D is not a binding precedent, it should be a persuasive one. In the circumstances it might be wise for us to ascertain what is going on in the other four Committees which are considering this matter. If we are to be the one to go on sitting when all the others have risen, I submit it will be extremely difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already ruled
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0430">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>781</span>
that this is a most unusual situation and that what happens in the other Committees has nothing to do with what happens in this Committee. I am sure all hon. Members will agree that we have had an interesting debate on a very important clause and I submit that the Committee should proceed. If at any time the Government want to follow the example of other Committees and move to adjourn the Committee, I would accept it forthwith.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Ellis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have sat here attentively. I have had no approach to indicate that conditions in this Committee concern anything other than the contents of the Bill. I back up my hon. Friend's statement that we should get on with the matter. I assure both sides of the Committee, and the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells), that I am always available for consultation. I support my hon. Friend's view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must pursue this further. I am reluctant to get involved in an argument in public with the Government Whip. I know the difficulties he faces because I occupied a similar position for a number of years. As a member of the Government he is in a difficulty because he has no ministerial, departmental responsibility, and we are grateful to him for having gone as far as he has. He made one remark however, about which I must protest when he said the representations had not been made to him—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Ellis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was making a genuine offer of assistance to any Member of the Committee, including my opposite number. I said that we had not had consultations on the difficulties we face now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are going hack to where we started. We are debating the question of the Adjournment when I have ruled that we are not to debate it. I cannot take these continual points of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Have you ruled, Mr. Costain, that the public expenditure involved in the Bill has nothing to do with the castastrophic defeat of the Government last night? The Director-General of the National Trust
	<span class='label label-info column'>782</span>
said that the cost of preserving the nation's heritage if private owners are compelled to give up the struggle will be very great. He said that the National Trust should not be regarded as their natural successor. I believe that this Bill and the new clauses will have a very great impact upon public expenditure, and on that ground alone we should adjourn the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has overlooked the fact that the House has passed a Money Resolution on this Bill and the vote last night has no direct bearing on it. I have suggested once before that the Opposition should kick for touch and that we should get on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to pursue this matter. I gave way to the Government Whip and I was unable to complete what I was going to say. I made representations to the Minister before this sitting began, suggesting that we should not proceed. It would be wrong for the Whip to suggest that these representations were not made. The proper channel is that I should make representations to the Minister and for my hon. Friend the Opposition Whip to make representations on his side. So far as I am concerned those representations were made and, therefore, it is right for me to put that matter straight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in an unprecedented position. Our remarks are directed basically to persuading the Government to move a motion because you have said, Mr. Costain, that you would be prepared to accept such a motion from the Government. I understand that you will not accept such a motion from the Opposition. This whole situation has devalued the debate on new Clause 7. That is basically the fault of the Government for allowing the debate to proceed in this general air of uncertainty in which one Committee has been suspended and another has been adjourned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have accepted that we are in an unusual situation and I have ruled, rightly or wrongly, that this is not a point of order.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may suggest a way out. The Government Whip has offered his services. He is in a position to move the Adjournment of the Committee. Surely the right course is for him to make enquiries of his colleagues in other Committees—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, let us have a short suspension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We know that one of his colleagues has moved such a motion, and I am informed on very good authority that such a discussion is proceeding in one of the other Standing Committees. If the Government Whip in this Committee discovered that his colleagues were acting in the same way as the Government Whip in Standing Committee D he could then move the Adjournment here. The matter would be settled one way or the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What goes on in the usual channels is as much a mystery to me as to any other hon. Members. If the usual channels want to come to an arrangement that is for them to decide. That is outside the jurisdiction of the Chair.

Hon. Members have used this opportunity to raise a number of issues which do not relate strictly to new Clause 7, but I will reply briefly to them because they will be deployed at greater length on new Clause 8. I hope that we shall be able to make progress with these clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have gone to great lengths to accommodate the Opposition over this Bill. We agreed to adjourn the Committee in order to put down the new clauses; we then agreed to have a debate on the Floor of the House; we then agreed that we would not meet on the day after the debate in the House so that hop. Members would have an opportunity to table amendments. I hope that the Opposition will now respond to what the Government have done and enable us to make progress this morning.

The hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) made the longest speech of the morning. It consisted almost entirely of a passionate advocacy of the interests of private landlords. He spoke at some length about the financial hardships to which he suggested they were being subjected at present, and he paid a glowing tribute to the enormous contribution which he says they make to the countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are good landlords and bad landlords. Good landlords make a very valuable contribution to the infrastructure of the countryside. It must be said, however, that, basically, what we are about here is to alter the balance in law between the respective rights of the tenant and of the landlord. Both the major parties accept that it is right that the framework for this balance should be set in law. There was a time when all these arrangements were entered into outwith the law. It was purely a matter for private treaty and private bargain or agreement between the landlord and the tenant. Here, however, we are altering the law once again to enhance the rights of the tenant, and obviously that could only be done at the expense of the rights of the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no good Conservative Members repeatedly asserting that somehow they want to take care of the hardship cases but without altering the balance. These
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0432">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>785</span>
new clauses are basically to strengthen the position of the tenant farmer, and in particular to remove the hardship which the Conservatives have acknowledged takes place on occasions. It was a little surprising for the hon. Member for Macclesfield to make great play of the fact that he met landlords over the last couple of weekends and that he could discover not one instance where they had refused to allow a son to follow where the son wanted to do so. If that is so, why are they so opposed to our enshrining that position in the law?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must tell the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) that the provision applies to the Ministry of Agriculture farms but does not apply to smallholdings, whether they be local government smallholdings or Ministry of Agriculture smallholdings. The Ministry Farm Settlement Estates at Sutton Bridge and Holbeach were formally designated in 1952 as smallholdings, and in view of that designation, and since they are subject to the regulations on smallholdings, they are excluded from the new clause as it stands. I understand that this is a contentious matter which hon. Members will want to raise at the appropriate stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the debate on Monday the Minister said that an instruction had gone out to those who managed the Ministry's farms that sons and near relatives should retain priority in these matters. Then he explained that in two years there had been 67 relettings of Ministry farms. Were these at Holbeach and Sutton Bridge, and if so is there not a contradiction in that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. They were not. There is a distinction, as the hon. Member will know with his legal training, between what we are proposing should become the law and what the Minister does through the administration of his own holdings. Last year we decided, in keeping with our own attitude on these matters, that we would issue an instruction through the administrative machinery that a son should get priority. That applies to all Ministry holdings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear to me what the Minister means. He said on Monday:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is no exemption from this legisla-
	<span class='label label-info column'>786</span>
tion for the Ministry's tenanted farms ".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 8th March 1976; Vol. 907, 	<i>c.</i> 112.]</p></blockquote>
Presumably that means exemption from the new clauses. That means that the tenants will be able to inherit under the same procedure of going to the Agricultural Land Tribunal, I assume. Then I think he said that this was incorrect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a simple point. Surely the hon. Member recognises that the Ministry of Agriculture owns farms, which are not smallholdings, and that it also owns smallholdings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the difference between a farm and a smallholding?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member knows, there is legislation which governs smallholdings, and there are regulations applying rules to the succession and allocation of tenancies on smallholdings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course there are. The hon. Member should appreciate that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Statutory smallholdings—we all know about them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have referred repeatedly to the 1970 Act which applies to smallholdings. The reference that I made to what happened last year relates to an administrative decision. We believe that it is right and proper that the son should be given priority.

New Clause 7 corrects an anomaly which exists as regards assigned tenancies. It appears that we all accept the need for these provisions, especially the new clauses which provide the scheme for succession. I commend new Clause 7 to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause read a Second time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as an amendment to the new clause, in line 7, leave out "three" and insert "eight".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment has been suggested by the Country Landowners Association. Its purpose is to alter the time in which a landlord has to serve a notice to quit after the death of a tenant. As matters stand, under Section 24(2)(	<i>g</i>) of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948, the landlord has three months in which to serve his notice to quit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0433">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>787</span>
There have been various instances in the past in which landlords have been unbelievably insensitive in serving notices after the death of a tenant within an indecently short time. Many years ago, during the proceedings of an agricultural Bill, I well remember our much missed friend, Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie, who represented Ross and Cromarty and who, no doubt, was known to the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells) displaying understandable fury when referring to a situation in which a landlord served a notice to quit to the family of the deceased tenant immediately after the funeral. That was an unbelievable thing to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even the three-month rule has led to criticisms about insensitivity which, I believe, have been entirely justified. If a landlord wants to retrieve possession of his farm on the death of a tenant, unless he gets the notice to quit served within three months of the death of the tenant he loses his opportunity to retrieve. If the amendment is not accepted, that situation will continue when there are no relatives of the deceased tenant, or near relatives, who qualify as eligible persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a farm tenant dies and it is clear that there will have to be a sale or a totally new reletting, I understand that Section 24(2)(	<i>g</i>) will still stand. There have been somewhat bizarre cases in which efforts have been made to hide the news of a tenant's death from reaching the ears of the landlord. I understand that the Ministry is only too well aware of that having happened. I understand that there is evidence that on one of the Minister's own farms the news of a tenant's death was kept from the Minister's representatives so that the three-month period would be taken up and the landlord would not have the opportunity to serve a notice under Section 24(2)(	<i>g</i>). I understand that other examples of that nature are known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The three-month rule is extremely valuable for the landlord when there are no eligible persons whom the tenant has left behind. I suggest that it is not unreasonable that the period be extended. The amendment suggests eight months. I understand that the Minister's consultative group recommended that extension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will not suggest that the amendment is pie in the sky, and has just been dreamed up by
	<span class='label label-info column'>788</span>
the Opposition for this occasion. I notice that the hon. Member for Ren-frewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) is not present. I guess that that would have been the gist of the hon. Gentleman's speech. I suggest that the recommendations of the consultative group adds a good deal of weight to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister thinks that eight months is too long and he tells us that he will table an amendment on Report to provide for six months or four months, or whatever the case may be, we shall be prepared to consider that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole purpose of the seven new clauses is to deal with a few cases where especial hardship or wrong has occurred. No one is claiming that we dealing with a mass wrong. We are right to consider both sides of the fence. Bearing in mind what has taken place in the past, there is good reason for extending the period. To extend it would inevitably make it less likely in future for tenant families to be tempted to become involved in such unfortunate deception.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the case put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling). The only good thing to emerge from the Parliamentary Secretary's insensitive response on Second Reading was the indication that he would show some flexibility towards amendments. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will show some reason and flexibility in his approach to this reasonable amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a way, the amendment is supported by the hon. Gentleman's Department. It may be that the need for the amendment stems from developments in recent years resulting from Government taxation policies. More and more estates have, unfortunately, come into the hands of institutions, passing out of the hands of private landowners. I am sure we understand the problems of tenants who have to deal with large institutions through estate agents or other agents; there is not the personal relationship which exists between the tenant and the private landowner. Very often the private landowner lives in the vicinity, in the community, in the village.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will cast his mind back and remember the extent to which the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0434">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>789</span>
bonanza in institutions taking over estates and farms occurred during his party's reign.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to comment on that. I was extremely critical of taxation which drove private landowners out of business because of death duties. The situation has been worsened by capital transfer tax. As a result of the taxation that we have imposed, private landowners have been forced to dispose of estates to large institutions on death, and sometimes even before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are good, personal reasons for the Minister to accept the amendment. If he does not accept that the period should be extended to eight months, let him consider six months, five months or four months. I am sure that we all accept that it is insensitive to send a notice to quit to a tenant's family shortly after the death of the tenant. We need flexibility. For a month, two months or three months after the tenant's death, the bereaved family will still be suffering. It will probably be suffering well beyond three months. It causes sourness and unpleasantness if a notice to quit is foisted on them after such a limited period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a political amendment. There is nothing that the Ministry can lose by giving ground. At both ends of the scale, where an institution is leading with a tenancy, or where a private landowner has control, the situation can only be improved by accepting the feeling and purpose behind the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If eight months is not good enough, I shall accept the Minister's ruling. However, I believe that there should be a considerable extension from the present three months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) has referred to insensitivity. He has also mentioned premeditated cases in which the death of a tenant is concealed. However, there are inadvertent cases. These arise especially in very rural areas. They can arise through no fault on the part of the tenant or the landlord. It is not necessary to be very clever or imaginative to appreciate the situation which arises in a relatively isolated area in which people do not see very much of their neighbours. I know of an instance where
	<span class='label label-info column'>790</span>
this has happened and in which no blame could be attached to either party. First, the tenant's family did not know that it should inform the landlord that the legal tenant had died. In fact, the son had been farming the tenancy for many years. There was no statutory requirement for the son to inform his landlord that his father had died. The son did not do so, but that was for no premediated purpose; he did not know that he had to tell the landlord. Perhaps the landlord was remiss in not keeping in close touch with his tenant. In any event, the whole situation was not on a proper legal footing. If subsequent clauses of this Bill are passed and we agree to the succession provisions, it is very important that we take care of this aspect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some doubts about this amendment. The question of the time given to deal with a notice to quit is very important. We do not want it to be too short, but neither should it be too long. I have known cases where only one month's notice has been given and some vital matters have had to be carried out in that time. I have known of some cases, mainly of Fen farms or small pieces of glebe land, where the tenant lives elsewhere and the agent is some distance away. I do not want to encourage the growing tendency of absentee landlords and agents managing estates in East Anglia or Northumberland from London. with the landlord not taking a close personal interest in the tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see the force of extending the notice to quit to four months, but eight months would be dragging out the matter too long. I know that the consultative committee has been considering this problem and I hope that we shall look at every notice from a practical point of view. We do not want to serve a notice to quit immediately upon the death of a tenant. but unless calendars are carefully marked it is possible to let the matter slip and forget about it. I would not be against a reasonable extension, but eight months is too long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nobody wants to be unreasonable in this matter. I know this scheme has been operating in Scotland for many years and perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could tell us
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0435">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>791</span>
whether it has been working in the way he would like to see it implemented in this country. The leaflet sent to hon. Members by the NFU concluded that the law in England and Wales should be based on that applicable in Scotland, but that there should be further restrictions and limitations aimed at avoiding any adverse effect on the landlord-tenant system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The consultative group suggested that there was a case for extending the period beyond three months, but the position has been changed now that the Government have introduced these new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells) that, in some important respects, the operation of the scheme in Scotland is different. This stems from the different background of Scottish legislation on these matters. We have separate Scottish law on a whole host of issues, and agricultural tenure is one area where we have different legal traditions and procedures in regard to applications made by tenants and landlords. We cannot look there for any help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause changes the position because a near relative will now be required to apply to the Agricultural Land Tribunal within three months of the death of the tenant for a direction that he should get the tenancy. It would be in that person's interest to draw the attention of the landlord to the tenant's death. Although there have been cases where relatives have attempted to conceal the death of a tenant beyond the three months in which the landlord could serve an incontestable notice to quit on this ground, it will now be in the relative's own interests to inform the landlord of the tenant's death at the earliest opportunity. The amendment is, therefore, unnecessary. If we accepted the amendment for the landlord, we would, in all fairness, have to accept it for the relative. I am pleased to see the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) nodding his assent. We have to consider whether there is a case for extending the period in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) rightly said that we have to be careful not to let matters drag on. It is in the interests of the tenant and, more often than not, the landlord that the matter should be resolved fairly
	<span class='label label-info column'>792</span>
quickly after the death of a tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three months is a reasonable period, particularly as we are introducing a statutory right to succeed. Within a week or so of a death, near relatives have to pick up the pieces, start organising things and face the implications of a new situation. I do not think we can be faulted on this time limit. As concealment will become less significant, I hope the Opposition will agree to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question of a timetable will be very important for the tribunal. Perhaps the Minister could indicate whether the Government are considering some rules for the convenience of advisers, tenants and landlords and a timetable procedure. This is most important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. The Government intend to lay down guidelines following the passages of this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not quite see what the incentive will be under the inheritance clause. Surely if a successor waits for three months, he is successor in title anyway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That depends on a number of factors. There will, perhaps, be a number of potentially eligible people who could apply to the tribunal, which would then have to arbitrate. If the period is too long, we might have one person applying after three months and another after six months. If the period were eight months, that time would have to elapse before any progress could be made. I hope hop. Members will agree that, on balance, it is in the interests of tenants and landlords particularly now that we have introduced the new element of a statutory right to succeed, that notice to quit or applications to succeed should be made within three months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move as an amendment to the new Clause, in line 8, leave out from "was" to "under" in line 9.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to discuss Amendment (c) to the new clause, in line 9, after " tenancy ", insert

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0436">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>793</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a highly legalistic clause and the amendments are technical and rather difficult to understand. I am very rusty on this law, but there have been brought to our attention some points on which we thought it right to table amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the present wording of Section 24(2)(	<i>g</i>) of the 1948 Act the death which counts is that of the original tenant. The new clause changes the wording to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the sole (or sole surviving) tenant under the contract of tenancy".</p></blockquote>
This does not appear to be necessary in the inhertitance provisions. Some professional bodies think the change may have unintended consequences. It may deprive a landlord of the right to serve a notice to quit when a tenant in occupation of a holding dies. If the tenant in occupation is not the sole or sole surviving tenant the landlord will not be able to avail himself of the Section 24 provision if the new clause goes through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition of a tenant in the 1948 Act is drawn extremely widely and includes people who, under (1)(b) of the new clause, would be excluded. A tenant farmer in occupation of a farm will not be the sole tenant in certain cases, if he is the executor of a deceased tenant. It does not appear that this will normally be cured by the exclusion in subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>). It will, on occasions, remove from Section 24 of the 1948 Act an occupier who happens to be an executor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a technical amendment. By referring to the tenant under the contract of tenancy, or in the case of a joint tenancy, the last surviving tenant, the amendment avoids this anomaly. I am sure that the Minister has been briefed on the matter. I am told that the County Landowners' Association has had no notice that the Government intended to make this change and that it has not been consulted on the matter. So far as I know, there have been no other consultations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears that the drafting is faulty because it has produced this anomalous situation. It highlights again how difficult it is to amend a major piece of legislation in this way without upsetting the delicate balance of law in the major legislation, which this Bill seeks to amend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>794</span>
I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us that the fears of the CLA and ourselves are unjustified. If he can do that we shall accept it. I hope that the Minister will be able to explain the matter to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) has struggled very well indeed to explain the implications of this matter. It must be clear to the Committee how difficult this issue is. I hope that the Minister will apply himself first to explaining why the change has been made. I understand that the implications of the changes to Section 24 of the 1948 Act have nothing to do with the seven new Clauses or with the principle of succession. The words which the Government are adding to the 1948 Act—" sole or sole surviving tenant " do not apply to the matter we have in hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Clause 8(5)(	<i>a</i>) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if the deceased is survived by a person who immediately before the death of the deceased was a joint tenant with him of the holding".</p></blockquote>
I am puzzled why the Government thought it necessary to raise this point under new Clause 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have purposely not reverted to these matters while debating new Clause 7, because I thought it would be better to confine discussion on it to this amendment. It is easier to deal with new Clauses on the Floor of the House. One can then deal with amendments first, but the way we are handling matters today makes matters difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members can still have a debate on the Question: That the Clause be added to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that point, Mr. Costain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The implication is that the landlord cannot serve a notice to quit to joint tenants even when there is no question of succession by a relative. I hope the Minister will explain what the situation is after the death of a tenant where there is a number of executors who are joint tenants. I know that I am now in danger of infringing on the next amendment but that is inevitable. The Minister must explain what the position is when there is no question of anyone succeeding to the tenancy, when there are people involved who are joint tenants because they are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0437">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>795</span>
executors, and there is an eligible person likely to take over. There could be a case where a bank manager, parson, solicitor and accountant became joint tenants because they are executors. The Government are breaking new ground, which is unnecessary in view of the provisions in new Clause 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is puzzling and I hope that the Minister will reply in simple terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a very technical matter. A notice to quit should apply to the actual tenant who was farming the farm, where it has been assigned. In so far as any other relative should be an eligible person under our proposals, then it should be the relative of the man who is actually farming the farm rather, than the relative of the original tenant who might have assigned the farm 40 years ago. We want to put the matter right. It is particularly important that we should do so when introducing a scheme for succession. There is no argument about that on either side but in doing that we have to ensure that in removing this anomaly we do not create any additional anomalies and that is what we are talking about now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point made about joint tenancies is a fair one. Let us take the simple situation of two joint tenants under the position envisaged under our scheme of succession. When the first joint tenant dies the surviving joint tenant becomes the sole tenant. That is the accepted procedure on joint tenancies generally. When the surviving joint tenant, who has become the sole tenant dies, it will be his near relatives who will have the entitlement to apply and who will be eligible persons under the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain what would happen if two joint tenants were killed in a road accident?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that in that situation all of the near relatives of both tenants would be able to apply. That would be common sense and it would be for the Agricultural Land Tribunal to decide who should succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should explain some of the terminology. Anyone who fulfills the criteria for being the appropriate near relative and has experience on the holding is an eligible person. In that situation all the
	<span class='label label-info column'>796</span>
sons of the joint tenants would be eligible persons, and I hope to clarify that when we come to discuss new Clause 8. The Agricultural Land Tribunal would then select the suitable person from those eligible persons who have applied. Having selected the one suitable person the tribunal would proceed to decide on the basis of evidence from tenant and landlord, whether the suitable person should succeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not more difficult to deal with that matter now than it would be on Clause 8 and the amendments on that Clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I said, but I was trying to be helpful to the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment has no substance, in the sense that the rearrangement of the wording of this provision does not appear to involve any substantial change in meaning. The reference to a person who immediately before his death was under contract of tenancy seems to be a less apt way of referring to the sole tenant under contract of tenancy, and the insertion of the reference to the last surviving joint tenant simply restores the existing reference to the sole surviving tenant under the contract of tenancy, which would include a last surviving joint tenant. That rather complicated sentence simply means that we do not regard the amendment as necessary. The purpose which hon. Members seek to achieve exists already in the present wording.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still do not quite follow the Minister, although I am sure he is accurate when he says that he has taken advice on the matter. The CLA says that when the tenant farmer becomes an executor the landlord might not be able to serve a notice. Is the Minister saying that this is not the case? People are worried that the change of wording will, in a few cases, prevent a landlord from serving a valid notice to quit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
