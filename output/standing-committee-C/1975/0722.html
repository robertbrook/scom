	<div class='clause'>Clause 15</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>RESIGNATION OF AUDITORS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 58 in page 19, line 21, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(8) A statement made by an auditor in section (2) above shalt be regarded as privileged in law'.</p></blockquote>
The purpose of this amendment is self-evident. In sub section (2) is the statement that is provided for the auditor to make in circumstances when he leaves the services of a company. It is my feeling that in those circumstances or indecd, in any circumstances where an auditor may feel it necessary to make a statement about a company, there should be protection for the auditor. I can understand there may be some fear that giving him this privileged position could lead to an abuse but I suggest that the auditors—those who are members of the professional bodies—are persons who can be entrusted with the power that this privilege gives them. This privilcge is necessary to ensurc that, if they have some doubts which they may feel in a court of law they may be unable to prove, but it is their balance of judgment in their professional capacity that these doubts do exist and should be voiced, they should have the safeguard of knowing the statement they make is privileged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is important to ensure that wherever there is any niggling doubt the balance of this legislation should encourage information to he brought forward. Unless something like this is in the Bill there could be a tendency fcr people to be hesitant about coming forward with information and making statements which thcy may feel in their hearts they ought to be making, but which they do not have full confidence would stand up in a court of law under cross-examination. I suggest this should be built into the Bill or some alternative statement of this sort should be accommodated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>364</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to speak against the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) because he has given much thought to this Bill and I think the reasons he has given in moving this amendment will appeal to many of us. Nonetheless, even this week we have seen a call by the Chairman of the Stock Exchange for firmer control of the workings of the Department of Trade Inspectors. At a time when there is much criticism about the abuse of privilege by those entitled to make statements about other people's good names, we should be very careful indeed before we think of extending that to large numbers of auditors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect, and perhaps the Minister will be able to tell us more, that there is already, or will be when this Bill becomes an Act, some degree of qualifying privilege in circumstances that wculd enable proper criticism to be made. But to extend that to an absolute privilege, as appears to be the intenticn of this amendment, would not only be profoundly wrong but profoundly dangerous. It would encourage those who might be deemed incomeptent—and already some auditors have been spoken of by qualified Members in this Committee as being weaker bretheren—if they had been voted out of office for proper reasons, to get their own back by the destruction of other mcn's good names in circumstances where those men would not be able to defend themselvcs or take proper action. I hope we shall hear more from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Law Officers' Department [Mr. Arthur Davidson]</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first of all apologise to the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) for not being here at the very beginning of his remarks. I appreciate his concern that auditors should be able to speak as freely and frankly and criticise as vigorously as they feel is necessary without fear of facing a libel action or an action for defamation, but I can assure the hon. Gentleman that statements by auditors in those circumstances are already subject to the law of qualified privilege unless they are motivated by express legal malice, that is, by spite, or some other improper motive. The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that circumstances in which absolute privilege is accorded to statements are very rare
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0865">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>365</span>
indeed. Statements in the Houses of Parliament and by witnesses in court proceedings are protected by absolute privilege.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I have taken up time unnecessarily on this. Can the Minister indicate under what provisions qualified privilege is accorded?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. It is already afforded to statements made by a person who has a duty to make that statement to another person or body who has a duty to receive it when there is a common interest in the statement being made. Then the statement is subject to qualified privilege. It is privileged in the absence of malice. A statement here would be made in accordance with a statutory duty. Such a statement is already subject to qualified privilege and it is not necessary, in those circumstances to write it into the Bill. Quite clearly, auditors have a statutory duty, certainly a moral and social duty to report their findings and misgivings to the company and the company has a duty to receive that information. In those circumstances I can assure the hon. Gentleman I am happy to state for the record that qualified privilege does exist and will continue to exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary, but I would be more grateful if greater clarification could be given on this. He is much more qualified in law than I am. May I have an indication whether this privilege is given under an Act or whether it exists in common law? I say this out of personal ignorance on the matter and would be grateful for enlightenment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terence Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a complexity here which no doubt the Parliamentary Secretary will clarify. It is raised in another context concerning inspectors of companies under subsection 165(	<i>b</i>). t would be helpful if we could know from the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) whether he intended the amendment to be directed towards absolute privilegc or qualified privilege. I assume that the amendment refers to absolute privilege. Perhaps that is something on which hon. Member could help us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>366</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there is a situation where qualified privilege does exist I would be happy with that because I accept that any statements with malice behind them should not be defended by the privileged position. If the qualified privilege does ensure that the auditors are in a situation to make the statements they genuinely and honestly believe it is necessary to be made—even though they may have certain doubts whether they can prove them in a court of law—that would meet the provision I had in mind. I accept that there are dangers in having absolute privilege and certainly in having it extended. If qualified privilege can do the trick that would be absolutely acceptable. I would be grateful if the Minister can give any indication of how this has come about so that I can be happy in my own mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it the situation now is—and would be under this Bill if no amendment is carried—that auditors have qualified privilegc, as the hon. Member has said. I think I am right in saying they would only be liable if action was taken in the courts and it was shown that they had actually been motivated by malice. The same situation applies to inspectors of companies under Section 165(	<i>b</i>) of the 1948 Act. They are not in the same position as the hon. Member for Caernarvon or myself, who could now say anything at all, whether motivated by malice or not and nobody could do anything about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And frequently do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister can make a remark like that and there is nothing I can do about it except totally deny what he has said. I cannot sue him in the courts. I have been appallingly libelled by him and there is nothing at all I can do about it. If he had only qualified privilege I could take action if I could show he was activated by malice. Perhaps the Minister can confirm that the situation is as I have described it. If I understand the hon. Member for Caernarvon correctly, he would not wish to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very happy to confirm that the hon. Gentleman's rendition of the law is exactly right.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0866">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>367</span>
Statements of this sort are already covered by the common law. There is a duty on the part of auditors to make statements. There is a duty on the part of the company to receive statements. So, in the absence of malice, spite or ill-will or general bad motives of that sort auditors need have no fear. They are already protected by the law of privilege.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not utter carelessness also apply as well as malice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has to be an expression of malice. If the statement is carelessly made it would be up to the auditor to correct it but it is privileged in the absence of malice. If the carelessness was of such a nature that there was behind it or spite or evil motives that would of course negate the defence of qualified privilege.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. The debate has been useful to me. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government will know that we certainly support the intention of this clause, which is part of a complex of clauses designed to ensure that if the auditors feel something is wrong they are in a position to bring it to the attention of the shareholders. We would not wish to dissent from that at all. The only point which puzzles me arises from the debate we have just had, because we are told that the auditor may resign and deposit a notice to that effect. Then the obligation is cn the company to send, within 14 days, a notice setting out the fact that the auditor has resigned and that either there are no circumstances connected with his resignation it thinks ought to be brought to the notice of members or creditors or that he has given a reason why he has resigned. That is the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Notices also have to be sent to any person who is entitled to be sent copies of
	<span class='label label-info column'>368</span>
the documents mentioned in Section 158(1) of the 1948 Act. All that is quite clear, but we are then told:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Copies of a notice need not be sent out under subsection (3) above, if, pn the apptication either of the company or of any other person who ctaims to be aggrieved, the court is satisfied that the auditor has used the notice to secure needless publicity for defamatory matter".</p></blockquote>
I am somewhat puzzled by that provision in the context of the previous debate. As I understand it, the person who feels he is aggrieved can prevent the notice being sent out and the auditor making his position clear if it has defamatory matter in it that would get needless publicity. Further, I am not quite clear about the nature of the court. I do not think it is defined, and I am not clear how anyone reaches the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt this is a simple legal point that the Under-Secretary can clear up. If somebody resigns as auditor and makes a statement that someone claims is defamatory, to which court does that person or company apply, and under what machinery?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is somewhat curious in view of cur previous discussions. t seems that an auditor can be prevented from making his statement on the ground that it contains defamatory matter. That is a matter for the court to decide. But a safeguard already exists that we discussed in a previous amendment—namely, that if an auditor publishes defamatory matter and his intention is to use the notice to secure needless publicity for it, malice must be implied. I do not see how any auditor who has made a statement containing defamatory matter and who uses a notice to secure publicity for it can be acting without being motivated by malice. I may be naive, but it scems that the right course of action in those circumstances would be for those who consider themselves aggrieved to take action in the courts on the ground that the auditor was motivated by malice and that privilege did not extend so far as to allow him to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that there is some simple explanation, as there was previously, but I am far frcm clear about the matter. I believe that we need the double safeguard of privilege not being absolute and the defamatory matter not being suppressed. Perhaps "suppressed" is too strong a word—the defamatory matter not being brought to the attention of the shareholders and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0867">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>369</span>
others. Presumably they have no other means of obtaining it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we read further into the clause, we find that the company can issue a statement to the cffect that the auditor has resigned, including the date on which the resignation took effect. At this stage we get into a curious situation. t may be that the auditor resigns, his statement explaining his resignation contains defamatory matter, and the court decides that he was giving it needless publicity. All that the shareholders know is that he has resigned and that his resignation took effect on a certain date. t seems that there is no means by which shareholders or creditors can get hold of the true nature of the auditor's views. I am not taking sides on the issue, I merely want to be clear about the Government's thinking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade [Mr. Clinton Davis]</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In Clause I5 (4) "the court" is the court which has jurisdiction to wind up the company in question. As I understand it, the court has to determine two issues—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for intervening so early in the Minister's reply, but this is rather like the peculiar case that we came across under the 1948 Act, where a section referred to a winding-up but not in the normal situation. Which court is it if the company is not being wound up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the High Court. I believe that in Scotland it is the Court of Session. It is not a question of winding up, but it is the court that has jurisdiction to wind up. That is distinct from the point that the hon. Gentleman has been making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The court has to determine two issues. First, it has to determine whether the statement is defamatory. Secondly—this is its most important duty—it has to determine whether thc auditor was securing needless publicity for the statement. The court is not there o provide relief for individuals who may have been libelled by the auditor. Any such persons would have the usual course of action available to them to seek redress. We re concerned with a statement issued by an auditor in the circumstances prescribed by the clause. Clearly it would be an abuse—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we must be
	<span class='label label-info column'>370</span>
very precise in this instance. As I understand it, the statement is not issued by the auditor, he merely gives it to the company, which in turn issues it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but the duty on the company is to circulate the statement. Therefore, there must be a remedy available to the company when a defamatory statement is made and when the auditor is clearly seeking to secure needless publicity for the defamatory matter. The company must have a defence against a situation that might arise if it has failed to circulate the statement. We are not dealing with an individual who has been libelled but with a specific situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is said that the defence of qualified privilege might be enough, but it must be recognised that it is not enough. One would be dealing with a situation that arose long after the statement. When an action is brought against the auditor in those circumstances it may be that the action will succced because malice is established. But that will not secure the remcdy for the company that is faced with a particular and immediate situation where it needs to be able to adopt a course of action for two purposes. ts first purpose will be to deal with the statement, and its second will be to have a defence for not circulating the statement. I hope that I have dealt satisfactorily with the points that have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another position might arise—I am not speaking now with any great authority—where a further statement is produced expunging the defamatcry material and where, because of the provisions in the clause and later in the Bill, the auditor is able to address a meeting that has been convened for the purpose, among other things, of dealing with the statement. He would be able to address his remarks to the mecting at the appropriate time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all the circumstances I hope that the Committee will feel that I have dealt with these points adequately. If the hon. Gentleman is worried about any other matters, he can raise them now or perhaps we can engage in correspondence about them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the Bill has a natural tendency to slow itself down. The moment that we look behind the wording some nasty things emerge from the woodwork. I am anxious not to slow
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0868">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>371</span>
down these proceedings unnecessarily, and I take the Under-Secretary's point about the auditor having the right to requisition a meeting, but if what he suggests is true, it means that the auditor has to go into the meeting cold, so to speak, in the sense that the meeting has had no previous notice of what it is he is worried about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the Minister's reply about the court. I understand that it happens to be the same one that would be dealing with the winding-up. That is an answer that on investigation would reveal the full picture. When a statement is made I understand that the person concerned can be sued because he has only qualified privilege, given that he is activated by malice. if the statement includes defamatory matter and the auditor has used the notice to secure needless publicity, surely that must be malice. I find it a difficult distinction that the Minister is seeking to draw.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has said that we are concerned with the company and not the individual, but that is not so if one reads Clause 15(4), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the company or of any other person who claims to be aggrieved."</p></blockquote>
That is a very wide expression. It is my impression that the drafting and the intention have not been considered as carefully as they might have been. I make no criticism on those grounds because in Committee we often stumble across various matters that need to be considered further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be happy if the Minister will consider the matters that I have raised between now and Report. At present it seems that there is a real danger that the shareholders will not see the entire statement if the auditor happens to go too far. All that happens is that the company informs them that the auditor has resigned, telling them the date of his resignation. I do not want to delay proceedings, but it is my impression that this is a little more dangerous than perhaps we suppose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that we are touching on matters that will be of crucial significance in problem situations in future. t is imperative that we should be absolutely clear. I hope that the Under-Secretary of State will use his experience and capacity to consider the wording before Report. I hope he will ensure that
	<span class='label label-info column'>372</span>
there are no ambiguities that will be distressing to those who might find themselves in situations of controversy in future. Parliament should give absolutely specific guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation that needs attention is where the auditor is in reasonable doubt, does not want to act in such a way as to bring down the whole pack of cards but feels that some sort of discipline is necessary. To go to the lengths of forcing the calling of an extraordinary general meeting marks out the auditor as a man who is seeking publicity or has become personally motivated. We need to find some intermediate method of exercising discipline that will not put the auditor at risk. He has to consider what might happen to the reputation of himself and his firm. If he is not supported at the meeting, or appears to have been wrong, those reputations may well be endangered. If we do not devise some intermediate form of discipline appropriate for an auditor who is in serious doubt but who cannot be absolutely confident that he is right, we shall force auditors not to act when some sort of action is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that subsection (4) is reasonably clear when it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to secure needless publicity for defamatory matter"?</p></blockquote>
Do we need to be more precise than that in the way that my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) has suggested? Is it not better that it should be left to the court to determine the matters that prevail at the time?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not a lawyer, but I understand that qualified privilege would lie between the parties concerned. If the information were to be given to parties not concerned, the court might hold that to be a degree of needless publicity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has satisfied me that there is the need for the protection of the company, particularly in the interval before a case can come to trial if it is to make a specific case. Therefore, I hope that the present wording will stay, subject to the Minister considering it closely to ensure that it is in order. As I read the subsection, the sense of it seems good. It seems that it is wise that the decisions should be left to the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It depends on the degree of publicity required for the specific business concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I shall look at the clause again to ensure that what we have required is right and clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is right that we should make this provision. t is distinct from the point raised by the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins). The question of malice is one for a subsequent libel action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that shareholders would come to a meeting cold, Clause 16 gives an auditor the right to have a further statement about his resignation circulated and, in any event, he has the right to address the meeting. If he imports into his statement something which is mailicious, he will render himself liable to an action for slander and the defence of qualified privilege may not be available to him. A company has to be provided with this power because otherwise it would be obliged to circulate a defamatory statement and that would be intolerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) said that an auditor who had reasonable doubts about the position might feel constrained not to issue a statement. But providing he acts in good faith, he will be protected by the defence of qualified privilege.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not an unknown circumstance. It is a problem which faces every inspector under a Section 165 inquiry. Those inspectors have to guard themselves and be sure that they do not act with malice. Otherwise, they are liable to an action for defamation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subject to the proviso that I shall look again at the points raised in the debate and at the drafting of the clause, I hope that the Committee will feel that it properly sets out requirements which the law ought to enforce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>RIGHT OF AUDITOR WHO RESIGNS TO REQUISITION MEETING OF COMPANY, ETC.</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause intermeshes very closely with Clause 15 and we support it in principle, but we should like the Minister to explain how it intermeshes with the rights given to auditors under Section 160 of the Companies Act 1948. Section 160 deals with the position of an auditor who has been asked to resign by the board. He is given the right to make representations which have to be circulated to shareholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 16 is slightly different. It deals with the case of an auditor who has decided to resign without action being taken by the board. He is given the right to make a statement which must be circulated to shareholders. The onus has shifted from action taken by the board to action taken voluntarily by the auditor. This is a difference of degree, but it would be helpful if the Minister could confirm who I have correctly interpreted the intermeshing of these provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope we may also be told how often the provisions of Section 160 and the rights conferred on auditors have been used. This information would help us to judge the usefulness of Clause 16 which goes to the heart of the Bill in giving to the auditor additional powers to match his additional responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same wording about needless publicity for defamatory matter is used in Clause 15(4) and Clause 16(4), though there is a difference in emphasis. Clause I6 goes much further. The auditor may ask the board to circulate to shareholders his reasons for resigning and it is almost inevitable that such a statement will contain defamatory matter and criticisms of the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The points made by my hon. Friends the Members for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) and Up Minster (Mr. Loveridge) in the previous debate about the care we should have in considering these matters and ensuring that they are properly drafted are even more important on this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Replying to the last debate the Minister said that it might be better to use the words "seek to secure" rather than
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0870">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>375</span>
"secure". Section 160 of the 1948 Act is drafted in, effectively, exactly the same way as Clauses 15 and 16. The Act says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that copies of the representations need not be sent out…if…the court is satisfied that the rights conferred by this section are being abused to secure needless publicity for defamatory matter".</p></blockquote>
Evidently the parliamentary draftsmen are satisfied that these words, which appeared nearly 30 years ago, have worked all right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If additional powers are being thrust upon auditors, they must have the appro-priate responsibilities to go with them. It would be very difficult for them to ask a board to circulate a statement to share- holders which contained criticisms of the board. We must ensure that the position of auditors, 	<i>vis-a-vis</i> the board and the courts, is properly defined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an auditor submits a statement to a board and requests it to be circulated to shareholders, directors must, within 21 days, call a meeting to take place not more than 28 days later—the normal period allowed for the calling of an extraordinary general meeting. If the auditor's statement contains a defamatory matter, that time- scale would imply a very quick submission to the courts, which would surely involve a great deal of publicity. Is the Minister satisfied that the court would be able to give a decision to the board so that the timescale provided for in the clause could be met?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers given to auditors go to the heart of the Bill and it is important that the wording is right. It would be very unfortunate if auditors, having had these new powers thrust upon them, were fearful of using them in case they fell foul of the board and were not supported by the courts. They might then have to pay considerable fines and costs which would do their reputation no good. I hope the Minister can assure us that he will look at the wording of this clause again before Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear from my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) that the wording in relation to needless publicity is the same in this Clause as in the 1948 Act. Unlike many parts of many Bills, this is a specific matter in which many varied circumstances would have to be taken into account by the courts and in which it would be
	<span class='label label-info column'>376</span>
difficult for Parliament to lay down precise and specific definitions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the words have been in existence since 1948, it is almost certain that a customary interpretation by the courts, based on case law since that time, will have been built up. It would be a pity if the Minister changed the wording so that a new interpretation were necessary or if the suggestion were made that Parliament wished to change the case law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that the wording is the same makes it more important that the Minister should keep it in the form in which it has existed for so long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I would like to raise with the Minister is the relationship between the auditor who resigns and his successor. As I understand it, Clause 15(2)(	<i>a</i>) refers to the circumstances connected with the resignation of the auditor which he instructs should be brought to the notice of the members or creditors of the company. There may be questions of audit procedure or technicalities which are not appropriate for publication and yet which perhaps should not be lost with the resignation of the auditor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to feel that Clause 16 provides the auditor with an opportunity or even an obligation to brief his successor as to the precise nature of the anxieties which he has met despite the fact that he cannot continue as the auditor to the company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) asked me how I see Section 160 and these provisions intermeshing. They deal with somewhat different situations. I do not dissent from his view of the legal position. He set it out admirably and concisely. These provisions are to deal with the situation of the auditor who wishes to resign in mid-term because of a situation which has developed and because it is necessary, and this is the view if all the professional bodies involved, to strengthen the power of the auditor and to give backing to the weak auditor. I am not saying that this will necessarily be the last word. It is the unanimous opinion of experts in this area that these provisions will do much to strengthen that position. The provisions
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0871">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>377</span>
are to be applauded for that desirable reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me how often rights were exercised under Section 160. I have no means of knowing that and cannot help the hon. Gentleman on that matter. It is not a question of Government responsibility. There are no statistics available to my Department. The hon. Member is right in saying that the reasons which would appear in the notice would inevitably be critical of the company and of those responsible for running the company, and therefore would be 	<i>prima facie</i> defamatory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman went on to suggest that there was conceivably because of that, the possibility of a deterrent arising for auditors. There is an effective deterrent at the moment but we are seeking to remove the deterrent. Of course, the fearful auditor, the auditor who is a little spineless, may produce if he wants to get out of the firm—a pretty weak statement. I should have thought that that would be a case where frequently the shareholders and creditors can read between the lines even if the auditor is not sufficiently firm of purpose. I do not think that is likely to be the situation as a matter of practice. I think that the auditors feel that it is essential that they should have these powers. I do not think that the majority will be deflected by fears of libel actions. They will know that they have the defence of qualified privilege. It does not deflect those appointed under Section 165 to produce reports or from discharging their duties fully and well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also referred to the question of timing. He referred, quite rightly, to subsection (3). Under the Clause the requirement to send out copies of a notice within 14 days would be infringed unavoidably by a company if it applied unsuccessfully to a court under Clause 15(4) claiming that the auditor was using the notice to secure needless publicity for a defamatory matter and if the company did not obtain a decision until more than I4 days after it had received the notice. t clearly would be in breach. We take the view that that is harsh and we propose to introduce an amendment at a later stage so that a company in this position would be guilty of an offence only if it did not circulate the notice within 14 days of the court's
	<span class='label label-info column'>378</span>
decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not wholly answer the point made by the hon. Gentleman. However, if he looks at subsection (3) he will see that it is an offence for the directors to fail to take steps to convene a meeting within 21 days of receipt of the auditor's requisition. The meeting must not be fixed for a date more than 28 days after the date of the notice convening it. If an application is made to the court it is unlikely that that timing could be applied. There are a number of possibilities that could then arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, if it were thought appropriate the meeting could be adjourned. Second, one need not rely on the statement at all. The auditor has a right to address the meeting and to provide a further statement in advance of the meeting. If there is insufficient time to circulate the further statement he has the right to demand that that statement be read at the meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister think that an auditor would be very hesitant to make an oral statement at the meeting if the board had already applied to the court saying that in its judgment the order was seeking needless publicity for defamatory matters and if the court had not yet given its judgment? Under those circumstances any sensible auditor would wish to keep his powder dry until he knew what the court's ruling was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Inevitably the auditor would act on legal advice in such a situation. It depends on how material the alleged defamatory remark is to what he is seeking to say. It might be possible to sever the two things. In a sense the shareholders and creditors will be put on notice by the fact that an action is pending. Although they must not prejudge the situation, they will be alerted to difficulties that have arisen. It is not the last word in securing the position that possibly may be defined. It is a desirable substantial improvement on the present situation and the power and strength of auditors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to raise a point which I hope the Minister will include in his consideration of the whole complex issues between now and Report. What worries me is the possible relationship between the decision by the court not to allow a statement to be issued because it is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0872">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>379</span>
said to be achieving needless publicity if a defamatory matter, and the subsequent stage when the meeting takes place, and yet again, the third possible stage, where an action is brought for libel. It would be very difficult, if the statement had not been circulated in the first place, not to influence the court subsequently, either in relation to whether further libels were being perpetrated at the meeting or whether they had been perpetrated already, and whether this was covered by a subsequent action in the courts for libel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me more is that the initial decision of a court not to allow a statement to be circulated in the first instance would inevitably, or to a large extent, determine or even predetermine, the result of a subsequent libel action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that it does that. The court is not at that stage dealing with the rights of a plaintiff and a defendant in libel action. It is dealing with a situation which is quite distinct from that. The court in this instance will be a different court because the court dealing with a libel action will be the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court. In any event it would be dealing with a different matter. t would not be dealing with the determination of a 	<i>prima facie</i> position. t does not concern itself with the question of needless publicity directly except in so far as it may affect the question of malice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that difficulties in this respect may arise. I do not think that we should be deflected from legislating here because of the possibility of difficulties. We shall have to see how experience provides us with further insight into this matter. I do not think that we have sufficient experience, based on Section 160, to determine the issue that the hon. Member for Upminster (Mr. Loveridge) has raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not investigated the case law but I will do so before Report stage. My understanding is that there is very little case law and therefore it may be that these words have not been interpreted by the courts. If that is the case, the point that the hon. Gentleman makes would not necessarily be a good one. If we feel it right we should, perhaps, make thc law a little more specific and tidy it up in the way suggested. That would have merit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>380</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has just said that he would look at case law on this issue before Report stage. It would be helpful. Although over the past 30 years there has not been much case law on this. I think that it will be a growth industry in the future because of the new powers that are to be thrust on auditors. Inevitably we shall find that auditors are in conflict with boards more frequently. We are giving them the powers to requisition meetings and we must expect the provisions and the protection given to the board in this clause to be used more frequently than in the past. t would be helpful if the Minister could look back at case law on this. He intends to look at the wording on needless publicity for a defamatory matter. Obviously that investigation on his part will take in case law questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am now advised that there are no reported cases under Section 160. I can conduct the most detailed research and come up with absolutely nothing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ought to have replied to the point raised by the hon. Membcr for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) that a good relationship between the resigning auditor and the successor is essentially a matter for the professional bodies to deal with rather than for the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that the application to the court to the effect that the rights conferred by this subsection are being used to secure needless publicity of defamatory matter would not be held 	<i>in camera</i> but in public. If I am wrong I would be grateful if the Minister would correct me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that they are held in public would inevitably give a great deal of publicity to this issue. Leading on from that, is it not inevitable that if, thereafter, the board decided to sue the auditor for libel, there will be a great deal of publicity?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the libel action is bound to take into cognisance the fact that the first court decided that the statement should not be circulated because it was seeking needless publicity and therefore was not protected by qualified privilege. These are legal but important points about which the Minister should satisfy us if we are to be certain that both auditors and boards are to be properly protected under the new
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0873">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

rights and responsibilities conferred under this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that we should not be deflected from making these provisions law because of the difficulties. I agree. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee wish to see this type of clause enacted. Nonetheless it is our responsibility to see that the law is as accurate and thorough as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his courtesy in saying that he would look up the case law on the matter to which I referred. I appreciate that when I know the Minister to be a busy man. However, as we now hear that there is no case law on this question, the point I raised hardly applies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the court has an inherent power to deal with this matter 	<i>in camera.</i> Proceedings in chambers are dealt with in that way. But that would not be the situation unless there were overwhelming reasons why a case should be heard 	<i>in camera.</i> The court is loath for that situation to arise as it conflicts with our basic democratic requirements. The court is slow to move along that course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the situation that the whole statement may be read out in open court? Is not that a curious situation if it is true?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the position inherent in any libel action. The libel is repeated, in a sense, in court. It must be repeated otherwise it is not possible to apply judicial consideration to the question whether the libel occurred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not concerned with the case of a libel action. I was concerned with the court considering whether the matter should be circulated. t is curious to say that the court shall decide whether something shall be published, and that the matter should be read out in open court to see whether it should be published. That is a strange situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not an authority on the

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has a point. If the Minister says that the clause provides that the matter should be referred to a court, as there is otherwise a threat of needless publicity, and if the case is not held 	<i>in camera,</i> we may change the words "needless publicity" to "maximum publicity". The matter is bound to receive far greater publicity by virtue of the referral to courts. Perhaps that is a reason why there is no past case law. Boards of directors may have taken the view that it was inappropriate to refer matters to court as they would be bound to receive headlines in the newspapers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because the court has an inherent power to deal with a situation of this kind by way of affidavit.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now turn to a somewhat different area, which is the question of the powers of auditors in relation to subsidiary companies. This is a matter which has given some cause for comment from the Society of Conservative Accountants, which has done an immense amount of work in considering these clauses. I understand that the Department has a copy of its submission. It takes a double view.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0874">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>383</span>
On the one hand it says that Clause 17 is not necessary and, on the other hand, that it should do something that it does not do now. Perhaps I might address myself briefly to both points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Society says that the clause is not necessary. It maintains that the present situation is adequately covered by the normal practice of a holding company's auditors making an inquiry of the subsidiary company's auditors. It is suggested that there is no problem in that area. I have some doubts about that. I am always a little worried that the extent of inquiries by the auditors of a holding company into the affairs of subsidiaries is not as great as it should be. The division of matters between the auditor of a holding company and the auditor of the subsidiary gives rise to problems. The present set-up under this clause, is, so to speak, from holding companies to subsidiaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point which is not covered by this clause gives cause for concern. It concerns the question whether the auditors of a subsidiary company have adequate means of establishing the position 	<i>vis-a-vis</i> the holding company. The instance is cited of a material amount which may be described as amounts owned by the group's companies. The auditor of a subsidiary has no means of verifying the validity or the existence of the assets involved. Therefore the creditors or the minority shareholders of the subsidiary assume that the statement is valid. The auditors assume that the assets are valid, but they have no means of checking whether that is so. Therefore it is suggested that we should include a provision in the clause to give subsidiaries adequate information, and provide the auditors of the subsidiaries with adequate information as to the assets which are held under the umbrella of the holding company. We should consider that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a further point about the relationship of the holding company to the subsidiary company on the question of the debts of the subsidiary company. A number of hon. Members have received representations on that point. Some of us may be aware of cases where this has presented a problem. I refer to the case where a subsidiary company has been lent money, or where a transaction has been engaged in so that a creditor of the subsidiary company exists. It may be that the assets of that subsidiary are clawed
	<span class='label label-info column'>384</span>
back to the holding company. When the creditor seeks to obtain money from the subsidiary he finds that the assets are not there. There is a problem if the creditor has relied on the good name of the holding company but finds that he has no legal claim against the company. There have been cases where that situation has existed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We ought to consider whether we should seek to cover that point, as apparently it is not covered by the clause. It would be helpful if the Minister commented on that in general terms. We may need to consider whether subsequent amendments would be helpful in clearing up the dangers which may arise if the position of the subsidiary company in relation to the holding company, or that of the creditors of the subsidiary company, is not fully protected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) criticised the clause on the basis of the memorandum of the Society of Conservative Accountants. His criticism was double-barreled. First he said that the clause was not necessary as the existing practice was adequate. Secondly, he said that something should have been included that was not included. That is a fair summary of his criticism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We appreciate that the purpose of Clause 17 is to ensure that the auditors of the holding company have as much information as they require about the affairs of the subsidiary companies so as to assist them in the audit of the group accounts. In spite of the hon. Gentleman's assertion that the provisions of the clause are unnecessary, at present the auditors of a holding company have no right of access to the accounting records of the subsidiaries. Nor have the officers of the holding company a legal entitlement to obtain from the subsidiaries the information which the auditors need and should have. Although it may well be the practice of the respective auditors of the holding company and subsidiaries to consult, there is a need, in the view of the Government, for a legal obligation on a subsidiary company to make information available in the event of the main company's auditors being unable to obtain it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The holding company has a duty to compile group or consolidated accounts and its auditors have need of information from all the companies in a group. I hope
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0875">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>385</span>
that that answers the hon. Gentleman's misgivings and explains the reason for the clause. It is to remedy that deficiency that the clause imposes on a subsidiary an obligation to give information to the auditors of a holding company. That is the requirement of the clause. Such an obligation may obviously only effectively be applied to companies incorporated in Great Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the purpose of the clause. However, I question whether it is necessary. I am not aware of any case where the auditors of a holding company have been unable to obtain satisfactory assurances from the auditors of the subsidiary company if they are not carrying out the audit themselves. My general impression is that normal accountancy practice covers that point. If the Minister says that experience shows that that is not the case, we see the argument for the clause. We seem to have been going on for years and years without this being a problem. At least, I am not aware of it, and I understand that many accountants are not aware of it. I do not know whether accountants think that there is a problem. I should be prepared to take the Minister's statement on a matter of fact, but he did not make a statement of fact. He made a theoretical case for a problem that does not seem to exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously I have not given facts. I accept that I based my remarks on a theoretical opinion. The Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies proposed the inclusion of a provision on the lines of this clause as, in its opinion, the power was necessary in practice. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has great respect for that body. Normal accounting practice deals with the situation. However, this clause deals with the awkward case where normal, good professional practice breaks down. The Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies was concerned to deal with the unusual case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why the provisions in this clause are thought to be necessary. I do not think I can expand the case further but the CCAB takes the view, as do the Government, that existing practice is not adequate. The clause as drafted will enable auditors to have information
	<span class='label label-info column'>386</span>
which, at present in some cases, they are denied and which I am sure the hon. Gentleman would agree they ought to have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously I would be misleading the hon. Member if I said I knew of any cases. Quite clearly I do not and if the hon. Gentleman would like me to write to him about it if I can discover some cases I would be happy to do so. That is probably the best way out of this. But I am afraid the CCAB does say that cases do arise. Perhaps that will enable the hon. Member to go some way to accepting the clause as being necessary, I will write and try to get rid of the hon. Gentleman's misgivings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does seem a pity that we should legislate in purely hypothetical circumstances if such they prove to be on further investigation. However, even if cases are known and discovered I am concerned about Clause 17(2) which seems to introduce an element of guilt by association. It says that every officer of a statutory company or a holding company which is in default shall be guilty of an offence and I do not see how every officer can be automatically guilty. The Minister himself has told us that this clause exists to deal with a case where professional practice breaks down. It may break down over an exchange of documents or it may even break down over clerical difficulties. Every officer or director who may be away building bridges in a far land or irrigating deserts could be held automatically to be guilty of an offence without even knowing about these exchanges going on. Even if some circular or minute had been sent out to him he might not be expected to read very closely through the small print. I wonder whether the Minister would look at this again to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0876">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>387</span>
make sure that if guilt there is to be, it is only for those who genuinely are at fault, and not the third parties who may be doing their duty perfectly well but who are not clear what is happening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has answered only half the points I have mentioned. If he knows of no cases and if his officials apparently cannot find one and as far as we know the Consultative Body has not specified any—the right course of action would be to make it clear, in the absence of such evidence, that the Government propose to delete the clause, particularly since it involves penalties for offences which apparently have not taken place since time immemorial. It is unnecessary legislation and it scems a shame to enact it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other relevant point arises where the subsidiary company's auditors are not able to find out what the position of the holding company is. There are cases, particularly in the context I mentioned, where there may be a tendency for the holding company to strip a subsidiary of assets and leave the subsidiary's creditors with little, if anything. There are other cases and the Minister has not covered them. We are in a silly position where the legislation is covering a situation which no one knows to have existed and yet not covering cases which we do know exist and are likely to go on unless we do some-thing about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was aware that I had covered only half the point. I am incredibly courteous and I was giving way to the hon. Member for Upminster (Mr. Loveridge). I can assure the hon. Member that I was intending to answer the point. I assure the hon. Gentleman that "officers in default" is carefully defined in the 1948 Act. We are covering old ground because we discussed this on an earlier clause. It means any officer in the company who willingly or unwillingly authorises or permits default. We would have to prove that the person in charge knowingly or willfully committed the offence. There is no risk of the person the hon. Gentleman is referring to being caught.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that assurance. We did cover a similar point earlier and at that time there was some hope held out that the 1948 definition might be written into this Bill. Then there
	<span class='label label-info column'>388</span>
would be some hope that those reading the Bill could understand it. Does that apply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If, on looking at it, there seems to be any ambiguity or doubt I will certainly consider whether it can be cleared up in this way, but the definition is very clear in the 1948 Act. On the general points the hon. Gentleman was making, I do not suppose he will be satisfied with what I am about to say because I cannot give him any specific case, but of course the CCAB is made up of professional experts and they consider this to be necessary. The CCAB has a wide expertise and it is not a body which would ask for a change of this sort if it did not think there was some basis for it. Perhaps we can leave that matter there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I deal now with the second point the hon. Gentleman made. He said that the clause failed to cover the inability of the subsidiary company's auditor to verify assets which consisted of amounts owed by the main conpany. I take the hon. Gentleman's point but it would not, in the Government's view, be proper to give the auditor of the subsidiary company a right to information from its holding company. The subsidiary company's auditors are concerned only with one company's accounts. Although the assessment of the value of debt owed by the holding company or other companies in the group can cause problems they would be no greater than those raised in connection with loans to companies outside the group. I understand the point but it is not, in the Government's view, appropriate to give auditors of a subsidiary company a right to information from its holding company. I hope that will explain to the hon. Gentleman why that point is not covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that is a very good reply. Let us leave the first point about whether the whole thing is necessary until Report stage. I hope I might put on record that we may at that point feel it appropriate to table an amendment to leave out Clause 17, which is a type of amendment not normally selected at Report stage because it would have been discussed on "Clause stand part" in Committee. If we table such an amendment in this instance our intention would indeed be to leave the clause out because we consider it unnecessary in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0877">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>389</span>
light of subsequent correspond I read that into the record for consideration at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other point, dealing with the powers of the auditors of a subsidiary to look at the position of the holding companies, there is a distinction here and I am not satisfied with the Minister's answer. t may be that if a subsidiary makes a loan the auditors can only say "There is a loan". It may turn out to be a bad debt. But it is clear that the subsidiary company making such a loan to a third party would have taken normal commercial steps to establish that the assets were there to cover it. That would be a right and normal commercial transaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are asking: What is the position of the subsidiary which apparently has a claim over some assets of the holding company? In those circumstances the auditors of the subsidiary do not necessarily know whether the assets are there. It is not unreasonable for them to say that they ought to be able to establish whether the assets are there. At the very least they ought to be able to get a straight assurance from the auditors of the holding company that assets are there adequate to cover the claim shown in the balance sheet of the subsidiary company. This is not an academic point, because of the practical problem I have mentioned where the holding company is stripping the subsidiary of assets and not meeting the claims of the creditors of the subsidiary company in full. It ought to be possible for the auditors of the subsidiary to find out what the true position is. I do not want to delay the Committee but this is something to which we will need to return. I hope that we will get an indication from the Minister that he appreciates that this is a real point and he will realise that we are not satisfied with thc inadequate explanation provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do take the point. I do not consider it to be an academic one and if there is a deficiency in the way the hon. Member has outlined it I wculd like to look at it. I give an assurance that I will look at it. The answer I gave was a very brief one. t may well be that it did not completely cover the point. Perhaps you will leave it with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not really clear what change this clause makes in the law as it now stands. It is concerned with the statement of first directors on application for the registration of a company and I would have presumed that these provisions were included in existing legislation. I am unclear why they should suddenly turn up at this point. No doubt the Parliamentary Secretary can give us a number of explanations and we can consider them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the clause is to put a stop to the frequent practice of newly incorporated companies failing to notify the registrar of the names of any directors or other officers. At present the only documents which the company seeking incorporation is required to deliver to the registrar are the memorandum and articlcs, together with a statutory declaration that the requirements of the 1948 Act in respect of registration have been complied with. Once the company has been incorporated it is necessary to notify the registrar of the names and addresses of directors within 14 days of their appointment. Many companies fail to comply with this requirement. As a result, there is no responsible person whom the registrar can contact if the company fails to meet subsequent obligations, such as the filing of its accounts. The clause is designed to prevcnt that situaticn occuring, by providing that a company shall deliver to the registrar with its memorandum and articles a statement giving details of the first directors and secretary. The officers named in the statement will be deemed to have assumed office from the time of inccrporation. This will ensure that a company has responsible officers and that the registrar knows who they are. The clause alters the existing practice in that regard. I hope that I have explained clearly the differences and the need for the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his explanation, but we must all be anxious not to burden companies, especially smaller ones, with an unnecessary load of form-filling and paper work. Is not one of the problems about the new provision that it is otiose? In many cases when companies are first formed and incorporated, the initial directors are names drawn from the lawyers, auditors or accountants who provide the technical means for the forming of the company. Those directors are often there only for a matter of days or weeks until the company starts doing something. In those circumstances, is there any benefit to be obtained by requiring that the statement of the first directors shall be delivered to the registrar, or is it just another instance of form-filling that has no purpose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arththur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman. At present, as I have already outlined, there is frequently no responsible person whom the registrar can contact if the company fails to meet subsequent obligations such as the filing of its accounts. The clause is considered to be necessary due to the inefficiencies of the present situation. I know that the hon. Gentleman is opposed to any unnecessary burdens being placed on companies, and so am I, but I do not consider that the information that is required is unnecessary or an extra burden.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am puzzled because the present provisions have remained unchanged for so long. There is a slight feeling of unease in my mind. From what has been said, it seems that the provisions in the clause should have been in a Companies Act ever since the existence of limited liability. It is not clear why we did not legislate in this way in 1967. What has provoked the Government into taking this action? No doubt, there is some legitimate explanation, but it seems so curious as to be worthy of probing a little further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These provisions were in the 1973 Bill. This is not something that has suddenly emerged.

	<span class='label label-info column'>392</span>
The hon. Gentleman will realise that the problem has become worse with the huge growth in the number of companies over the past 10 years.

	<div class='title'>NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES IN DIRECTORS AND SECRETARY, ETC.</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 68, in page 22, line 15, leave out `fourteen days' and insert 'three months'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is concerned with the notification of changes in directors and secretaries and relates to Section 200 of the 1948 Act, which is concerned with the making of returns of first directors and secretaries. It is suggested in the clause that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The company shall within the period of 14 days from the occurrence of"—</p></blockquote>
that is to say a change in the directors or secretary—
	<br><blockquote><p>"any change in the particulars contained in the register, other than a change consisting only of a director of the company becoming or ceasing to be a director of another company; send to the registrar of companies a notification in the prescribed form".</p></blockquote>
What is an adequate time for this change to be notified? It is suggested that it should be 14 days, but we believe that there is a case for making it somewhat longer than that. In earlier amendments we have suggested that there may be a number of burdens on companies, especially on smaller ones when the directors are concerned with the day-to-day business and are effectively running the companies. As a result, they may have various preoccupations such as stocktaking. Therefore, it seems that 14 days is a very short period in which they have to act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister says that he does not like three months, perhaps we could agree that it should be a month. I suggest that a fortnight will present difficulties for small companies—for example, where those responsible for operating them are on holiday. It is not infrequently found that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0879">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>393</span>
small family businesses close down for a fortnight's holiday or a three-week holiday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording as it stands seems to be excessively tight. Perhaps we might agree to split the difference, or something of that sort. I do not want to enter into fierce negotiations. I point out that two weeks seems too tight, given the normal length of holidays and the impact that this provision might have on smaller firms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has suggested that 14 days would create difficulties. I am sure that he already knows, as he is knowledgeable in these matters, that companies are already required to notify changes in their directors and secretaries within 14 days under Section 200(5) of the 1948 Act. I am not aware that that requirement has caused any problem. However, as he is always asking me to quote facts, figures, cases and examples where difficulties have arisen, perhaps I may throw the ball back at him and ask him whether he can give me any examples where difficulties have been caused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that it is important that the information on the files at Companies House relating to companies' officers should be as up to date as possible. Companies should regard it as their duty to notify changes as soon as possible. I think he will also agree that the notification of such changes is hardly a daunting task; in fact, it is a very simple one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has suggested that 14 days is unreasonable, but I do not think that even the smallest company would have difficulty in complying with the provision. I am always tempted to take a gamble and split the difference, but in this case I believe that existing practice has proved to be adequate. I believe that three months is over-generous. It seems that 14 days has not proved a difficulty in the past. In those circumstances, I must resist the hon. Gentlemans blandishments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When discussing the previous clause we were concerned with unnecessary publicity of a defamatory nature. I think that it might be considered to be publicity of a favourable kind if I stated exactly who had made representations to me on this matter on behalf of
	<span class='label label-info column'>394</span>
small companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been assured that there are problems for small businesses when holidays occur. In Section 200 of the 1948 Act a series of periods are provided, including one of 14 days. The representations that I have received relate to the problems that arise now. We do not necessarily have to leave everything exactly sa it is. I understand that the Minister may feel that he must adopt a conservative or even a reactionary attitude to these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to press the amendment, but if I receive further representations from the same impeccable sources between now and Report it may be that I shall have to return to the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite clear why these changes are necessary, given that cone would have expected them to be dealt with in existing legislation, especially the 1948 Act. As the wording is somewhat complex, it would be helpful if the Minister briefly explained the changes that are proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have noticed that subsection (3) refers to Section 9(3) of the European Communities Act 1972 and suggests a substitution for the existing legislation under the European Communities Act. I think it would be helpful if the Minister could elucidate upon that. I notice that the final lines of Clause 19(3) state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"but this subsection shall not affect the operation of the original paragraph (	<i>c</i>) in relation to any return sent to the registrar of companies under Section 200 (4) of the Act of 1948 as originate enacted …"</p></blockquote>
I have a nasty feeling that there are many legal pitfalls involved, one being whether we can amend the European Communities Act 1972. My hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) will correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that a number of the provisions in the 1972 Act are, to a considerable extent, immutable. I am not quite clear whether that presents a problem in relation to the clause. t will be helpful if the Minister gives a brief explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian Sedgemore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not altogether clear about the effect of the clause. Perhaps the Minister will make clear whether we shall get more or less information about changes of directors and secretaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, I am a shareholder in companies A, B and C, and I am concerned about the activities of someone who is a director of those companies. I am concerned because he is a Tory. I suspect that he is not earning his seedcorn and is up to nefarious activities. I hear through the grapevine that this director has also become the director of company D. Is this clause different in its effect from existing legislation? Would the director in my example have to notify companies A, B and C of his new directorship? Would they have to notify the registrar? If I made a search in mid-term of companies A, B and C, would I find under this clause, that the man who is causing me concern had become a director of company D?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I say at the outset—I shall come to the points raised by the hcn. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) in a moment—that on reflection I am concerned about the clause because of the reasons that have been enunciated by my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Luton, West (Mr. Sedgemore). I do not necessarily adopt that specific argument, attractive though it was. There is no doubt that there would appear to be scme diminution in the amount of information that would be available to the public. That is why I want to reflect further on the clause. One has to know how effectively the law has been applied hitherto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My information is that it has not been as effective as it ought to have been and it is not particularly easy to police. We must ask how we can make it more effective and whether we should be allocating a great deal of unnecessary effort to achieve that goal. We also have to ask whether there are other ways open to the public reasonably to ascertain this information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should look further at this matter before Report. I have indicated my doubts privately to the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins). There is substance in what my hon. Friend the Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>396</span>
Luton, West (Mr. Sedgemore) has said, although the clause was based on a recommendation of the Jenkins Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may have spoken in private with my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins), but the rest of us are slightly in the dark. When the hon. Gentleman referred to a diminution in the amount of information, he presumably meant that less information would be available about changes in directors than is currently available under Section 200 of the 1948 Act. I do not see why this should be the case. Can the Minister elaborate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not responsible for the liaison between the hon. Members for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) and Worthing though I should have thought that they were geographically so close that they could have got together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sussex is a big county.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I simply alerted the hon. Member for Worthing to my concern about this clause which I repeated this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause relieves companies of the need to make a return when a director becomes or ceases to be director of another company, but requires any notification of the appointment of a director or secretary to be accompanied by a consent signed by the person concerned. This requirement is designed to ensure that persons cannot be appointed without their knowledge. We want to keep that part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Section 200 of the 1948 Act, a company must make a return within 14 days of any change of director or secretary and of any other change in the particulars required to be entered in the register of directors and secretaries. The other particulars include not only such things as the director's address and nationality but also the directorships which he holds in other companies. If, for example, a director takes on an additional directorship, all the companies of which he is already a director are required to send a notification of the change to the Registrar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Jenkins Committee felt that this was not a burden which ought necessarily to be borne and the clause implements its recommendation. Under the clause, a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0881">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>397</span>
director will have to notify other companies that he has become a director or ceased to be a director of another company so that their registers can be amended, but there is no obligation on them to notify the Registrar until the annual return is filed. In the interim period, there would be a diminution in the amount of information available to the public when searching a register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection 3 makes a consequential amendment to Section 9 of the European Communities Act 1972 to bring it into line with the amended Section 200 of the 1948 Act. Section 9(3)(c) requires the Registrar to put a notice in the 	<i>Official Gazette</i> of the receipt by him of
	<br><blockquote><p>"any return retaking to a company's register of directors, or notification of a change among its directors".</p></blockquote>
In future, companies will no longer have to make a separate return of their first directors and secretaries and therefore there is no need to provide for the gazetting of the receipt of this return. The subsection makes the necessary amendment to Section 9(3)(c) while preserving the requirement to publish notice of receipt of any such return which relates to a company which has applied for incorporation before Clause 18 comes nito effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause is concerned with the registered office of a company. I know from my experience in Government about the problems of catching up with some companies who have failed to produce their accounts. This suggests that there is a case for tightening up the law on the notification of registered offices, but I am not sure that this clause covers the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty is often that a registrar is trying to get mail delivered to the directors of a company but when a postman arrives at the address, he has considerable difficulty finding the person concerned. The clause does not appear to cover that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4) of the clause says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If default is made in complying with subsection (1) or (3) above, the company and every officer of the company who is in default shall be liable to a default fine".</p></blockquote>
There are constant references elsewhere in the Bill to "default" and "fine", but I can find no other reference to "default fine" and I do not understand why the words are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also in this clause a similar problem about the European Communities Act. I am not clear whether we are able to amend this provision given the restraints of our Treaty commitments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not quite get the point that the hon. Gentleman was making at the beginning of his speech.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been considerable difficulty in obtaining accounts and other documents that companies are required to produce because of the problem in tracing the whereabouts of some individuals.

The purpose of the clause is to tighten up the provisions which require companies to have a registered office and to notify the registrar of its location.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 107 of the 1948 Act requires a company to have a registered office from the date on which it starts business or from the fourteenth day after its incorporation—whichever is earlier—and to inform the Registrar of its location and any change in the location. Under the new provisions, a company will be required to have a registered office at all times and to specify its intended situation when applying for incorporation, in the same way that the names of directors have to be specified under Clause 18.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many companies fail to notify the Registrar of the location of their registered office just as they fail to notify the names of first directors. The result is that the Registrar cannot easily contact responsible officers if a company fails to meet its obligations and there is also difficulty in serving documents on a company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is designed to prevent that difficulty by providing that a Registrar shall not register a memorandum or articles unless the location of the registered office is notified at the time the company seeks incorporation. The default fine is a maximum of £5 per day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the Government are trying to tighten up these provisions, but I wonder whether they are succeeding. Subsection (2) refers to the intended situation of a company's registered office. I accept that at the time that a company wishes to be incorporated, it must tell the Registrar where it intends to
	<span class='label label-info column'>400</span>
have its office, but there is no certainty that the office will be at that place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A company has only to tell the Registrar in advance that it intends to have an office at, say, 100 Fenchurch Street. There is no knowledge that it has set up an office there. We need to be able to establish a company's place of residence to ensurc that mail may be delivered there. In common parlance, a company can simply make the declaration "We intend to have an office at such and such an address". I do not think that will necessarily help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The main intention of the clause is to get the first address of the registered company. Companies are already required to notify changes of address. Subsection (3), requires a notice in the prescribed form to be given to the registrar within 14 days of the change in the situation of the registered office. There has to be a registered office first if there is to be a change. It is very difficult for the registrar to find out where the registered office is when a company is first set up. There are difficulties about enforcement, but it is already an offence not to notify the change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Section 437 documents arc deemed to be properly served if they are delivered to the registered office, that is, the address in the registrar's file, and are not returned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause tightens up the provisions. There may be difficulties of enforcement but the position under Clause 20 will be considerably better than at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that last point we must all have some doubts. Let us suppose that I wish to register a company with the registrar and I decided to notify the intended address as "c/o the hon. Member for Luton, West (Mr. Sedgemore)". We know of the hon. Member's interest in directorships of companies and particularly those which have Tory members on the board. What action will the registrar take to check that the address is correct? Will he not accept that this is the intended address and, thereafter, if there is trouble and someone wishes to pursue the company, the door hammered on will be that of the hon. Member for Luton West who will say that he never knew that I was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0883">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>401</span>
intending to give his address as the address of the company I was forming?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will that loophole be blocked up by using an intended situation rather than an actual situation? The implication of intention is that the arrangement could be a good deal looser than exists under the 1948 Act. I sympathise with the Minister. I am sure that he wants to tighten up the situation. So do I. From the examples which I have quoted I am not sure that he will achieve it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the smaller businesses, there seems to be one slight anxiety. I should like a reassurance from the Minister. A small company may get to the point of establishing itself but may not be in operation. It may not yet have premises. If it is using a home address will it get into planning difficulties under other Acts of Parliament? If the home address is given for the purpose of the registrar would that be adequate protection? Would that ensure that it is not troubled by planning difficulties? Will it be forced to hire a 	<i>post restante</i> address on a temporary basis to satisfy the registrar?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a difficult problem. It is not like the rather more sophisticated issues with which we have been dealing. It is the simple problem of whether we can find the people who are running a company. I know from experience in Government that it is a problem. I could quote hundreds of instances where this happens. We are all for dealing with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leaving the "intended" point on one side my experience is that it is not the new company that is the problem. If it is trying to avoid being traced that is unusual. It is usually with the older companies, which have been totally moribund for a long time, that there is difficulty in getting anything out of them. This is not a partisan point. There are members of all political parties in such companies. If this is so, is this the best we can do to ensure that they can be found? I do not want to push this or to prolong it. We can do little more than we have done here. There are some possible solutions such as declaring that if a company does not make returns it ceases to exist. That may have unfortunate repercussions on creditors. I would have thought that there
	<span class='label label-info column'>402</span>
is the possibility of some solution to this dilemma. I hope that the Minister will give further consideration to it before Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why, in subsection (4), is the fine described as a "default fine", whereas elsewhere it is normally described as a fine? The amount of the fine is not specified here, nor does it say whether it is limited. I have no doubt that it depends on some other points in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that this appears to be a difficult matter. I shall certainly look at it. If I send an invitation to the hon. Gentleman asking him whether he has any suggestions perhaps he will write to me with them. My hon. Friend and I will be happy to consider them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall look at that point about default fines to see whether it is necessary, and why the description is different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>DISQUALIFICATION FOR PERSISTANT DEFAULT IN RFLATION TO DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS TO REGISTRAR</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 111 in page 24, line 15, after 'period', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'beginning with the date of the order and'.</p></blockquote>
This is a drafting amendment which clarifies the date on which a disqualification order begins. It meets the point which was made on what was originally Clause 7 and is now Clause 9 of the Insolvency Bill. It is also relevant to the drafting of Clause 21.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause refers to the maximum length of a period of disqualification, but the date of commencement of any such period is not specified. The amendment clarifies the position by asserting that the period commences in all cases with the date of the court order and not from any earlier or later date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are proposing to make a similar amendment to Clause 9 of the Insolvency Bill at Report stage. I hope, therefore, that the Committee will feel this is an appropriate amendment to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0884">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>403</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 90 in page 25, line 5, leave out 'ten' and insert 'twenty-one'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment needs no explanation. The point deals with the amount of notice which the Secretary of State shall give of his intention to apply for an order under this section, to the person against whom the order is sought. On the hearing of the application, the person may appear and give evidence or call witnesses. In essence, what is worth inquiring into in this subsection is the question of how long it is likely to take for communications to reach the individual who may be affected. We were speaking just now of the problem of accommodation addresses and whether the company's office address was adequate. If someone has been persistently in default—this is not infrequently the case—the registered office may be difficult to trace. I wonder whether, because of the possibility of an accommodation address or something of that kind, it is sufficient for the Secretary of State to give only ten days' notice. It may have to go a long way before eventually reaching the individual concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If someone is to be disqualified cn the grounds of persistent default it seems a little unnecessary suddenly to say that he has only 10 days. Twenty one days gives a person greater time to respond. I am not greatly wedded to the idea but in the circumstances 21 days is better than ten days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is quite an important amendment. Ten days is not a very long time. The words "persistently in default" and the reference to five years imply that there has been a long record in this matter. In ordinary circumstances I suppose that this would have been the case. t is also possible for three or more defaults to fulfill that requirement and these could have arisen on a single occasion. Therefore, there is no absolute necessity for there to have been this prolonged background of build-up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the element of the Scottish courts being brought into this clause. I had an infortunate constituent who had a disastrous experience with a conflict of law arising between the Scottish courts and our own courts. There is no doubt that if such a conflict were to arise it would give cause for considerable delays in these circumstances. When such a person is
	<span class='label label-info column'>404</span>
receiving such a letter he must surely have time to get himself prepared, to get legal assistance and establish what his case is before the hearing. Not only should the time be extended from 10 to 21 days but there should also be a personal service and one should not rely merely on recorded delivery letters. I hope that the Minister will feel that 21 days might be more appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot agree with the hon. Member for Upminster (Mr. Loveridge) about personal service or on extension from 10 to 21 days. What we are dealing with is simply the Secretary of State's notice of intention to proceed and not with the disqualification application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Additionally to that period, the court decides what time should be permitted for the case to be prepared. Therefore, there is no reason to detach ourselves from the period which has been prescribed in Section 188 of the 1948 Act. A similar period is prescribed in the Insolvency Bill. If we have different periods prescribed I think we would get into a state of confusion which would be undisirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If someone says that they have not been appropriately or properly served with a notice and can satisfy the court of that, the remedy is quite clear, and the court is able to intervene on behalf of that person and to say that proceedings have got to start again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not dealing with a new situation. We are dealing with someone in persistent default. If we are to carry the point that we must embark upon personal service it will elongate the procedures and, if not fatally affect them, will seriously impair their effectiveness. If, as we expect, the Supreme Court Rules will provide that the application has to be made by originating summons, that summons will have to be personally served. I am not anxious for the notice of intention to be personally served. That would be a serious disadvantage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is a drafting amendment. t makes it clear that overseas companies with a

	<span class='label label-info column'>405</span>
place of business in Great Britain are to be included amongst those companies in respect of which persons disqualified under Clause 21 may not act as director or take part in management.

	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cecil Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find myself in a difficulty with this Clause. I agree that, if Parliament says that the returns should be filed, they should be filed. However, it seems rather strong to say that we should disqualify somebody for not submitting the annual return. The annual return is not a big event in the life of most companies. It is of consequence to only a few people. The annual returns of the majority of companies will never be inspected by anyone. It is not unnatural for busy people running small businesses not to regard the submission of their annual returns to the Registrar of Companies as one of the highlights of their year. It is true that some directors of small companies are lax in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I declare an interest. When I was in practice, this was part of my firm's service. We submitted the annual returns. Sometimes they were overlooked. Sometimes emergencies occurred and people were busy. This return was not regarded as an important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Small business men and trade union leaders are at one in their attitude to the annual return. I remember within the last six months seeing in 	<i>Hazard</i> a reply to a Question. An hon. Member asked how many trade unions had submitted their returns and accounts, as required, to the Registrar of Friendly Societies within the time limit. The information was given that a staggeringly small proportion had bothered and that the majority of trade unions were well behind in the submission of their returns. Some of them were years behind. I do not think that that makes them bad trade unions, but it shows that busy people tend to regard the provision of data as not being a principal occupation. The good trade union leaders get on with
	<span class='label label-info column'>406</span>
looking after the interests of their members. They try to improve their members wages and working conditions. For instance, if Mr. Joe Gormley were reminded the week before his annual conference that it was about time he sent in his return.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the hon. Gentleman is mis-stating the position. As an accountant, he knows that the process of determining default in this context is a long process. The essence of this matter is that there must be three or more convictions or default orders made against a person for relevant offences within a period of five years. That is far removed from neglecting to file a return. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will come back to reality and bear in mind that fact that the Tory Government put forward this proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not deny that the proposals were put forward by my Government. I do not deny that this Clause has been at the heart of departmental officials' plans for a long time. To them the submission of the annual return is one of the big events in a company's year. The fact that a return is not submitted may upset them, but that does not make the matter important. Officials tend to regard the matter as important. Businessmen and trade union leaders, who live in the real world, are at one. They see these returns in a perspective which this clause suggests that the Government and the Department do not see.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to correct another impression. I do not want the hon. Gentleman to imagine that the Department of Trade run ceaseless parties celebrating the fact that companies actually file their annual returns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was hoping that the Minister would tell us that they did. I have often wondered what those people did. I do not refer to those present this morning to advise the Minister. They have demonstrated that they are a hardworking group. Even the Parliamentary Secretary has been able to appear learned and knowledgeable as a result of their ministrations. That is a major coup.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not quarrel with the clause. I do not intend to vote against it. However, I felt that this was a worthwhile opportunity
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0886">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>407</span>
to point out that the submission of these returns, important though it is, is not of predominant importance. Clause 21 is a case of over-kill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for raising the point. We have covered this ground before, but perhaps it will be worth returning to it on Report if we have the opportunity. There is a need to treat small companies separately from large and middle-sized undertakings. I am sure that the Minister made a mistake in not accepting the earlier statement and that we shall have to return to this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: t would be helpful if the Minister briefly outlined the position of this clause, as he sees it, in comparison with the related clause in the Insolvency Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is referring to Clause 9?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand it to be the Minister's intention to drop the clause in the Insolvency Bill if this one is passed. Perhaps I have misunderstood the position. It might be helpful if the Minister were to inform us of his intentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause I propose to include in the Insolvency Bill deals with the register of disqualified persons in that narrow context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I first deal with the points made by the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South (Mr. Parkinson). I dealt reasonably effectively and, I hope, destructively—with the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that these matters are not important. That was the gist of what he sought to convey to the Committee. He referred to over-kill. There is undeniable evidence that persistent default must be taken seriously. Representations have been made to me by Members of Parliament. I know from what I observed as a back-bencher—not from my knowledge of what went on within the Department—that Ministers in the Conservative Government received similar representations about this form of persistent default. The matter must be taken seriously. This clause takes it seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) suggested yet again that a distinction should be drawn between
	<span class='label label-info column'>408</span>
small and large companies. There are certain basic essentials and duties that are vital to being incorporated and having the privilege of limited liability. I do not believe that it would be right for the impression to go out from this Committee that we take these matters lightly. Matters were taken too lightly previously and, as a result, there were too many persistent defaulters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall not harass people unreasonably. A prosecution is the end of the road. Hon. Members who are familiar with this problem—especially the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South—know that that is so. We are dealing with a situation in which a person has had three or more convictions or default orders within a period of five years. I believe that there is overwhelming support from hon. Members on both sides that there should be this additional sanction. It is not a question of over-kill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Attention was drawn to the relationship between old Clause 7 and new Clause 9 of the Insolvency Bill. Clause 7 of that Bill gives power to disqualify a person if he has been a director of two or more insolvent companies wound up in five years, or if his conduct of any of those companies makes him unfit to be concerned in the management of a company. This is part of a package dealing with people who are not behaving as they should as directors of a company. I believe that, read together, they operate as a substantial improvement in the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments are important as there is a lacuna in the law.
