	<div class='title'>MEASURES TO RESTRICT THE GROWING OF MALE HOP PLANTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed—(22nd January)</i>—No. 24, in page 5, line 29, after the word "area", to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"of less than 9 square miles"</p></blockquote>
—[	<i>Mr. Body</i>].</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Gavin Strang)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State has to be elsewhere on important Government business, so I shall continue the remarks he was making in reply to the debate on Amendment No. 24.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) will recognise that the amendment will have the effect of increasing the costs of designation and confuse those whose interests may be affected, since designation orders might be made for a number of contiguous areas. For example, if one decided to cover 27 square miles, a number of orders would be needed under this amendment, whereas it could be covered with one order, given the flexibility of the clause. Moreover, to protect female hops adequately at any one point could conceivably require a quite substantial area, equivalent to about 28 square miles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holland with Boston expressed his concern and the fear of some hop growers that the clause could give the Minister powers to prevent the growing of male hops throughout the country without coming back to the House for further authority. I can assure him that these fears are unfounded. Subsection (4) provides that any order made under this clause will
	<span class='label label-info column'>298</span>
be subject to negative resolution by either House. Moreover, subsections (2) and (3), taken together, provide for those concerned to make their views known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member expressed his understanding that the clause was intended to provide for the experimental growing of seedless hops. That is not so, as my right hon. Friend made clear in the Second Reading debate, when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… this is not an experiment but a commercial proposition".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st December 1975; vol. 901, c. 1332.]</p></blockquote>
That is the light in which these proposed measures must be judged. The Hops Marketing Board has carried out experiments in the past but now feels, with many growers, that it would like to proceed, perhaps with caution, into commercial operation. Therefore, it sought our help, which is provided for in this clause, for the benefit of the industry generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concern has been expressed about the effect of this measure upon the taste of beer. Male hops are not used in brewing. The taste of beer attributable to hops is dependent upon the variety used and is unaffected by the seed content. Some hop varieties are better grown seedless. and the growing of such varieties will be helped by this measure. Of course, other varieties will continue to he grown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of these remarks, I hope that the Opposition will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Parliamentary Secretary clarify his last remark about the hops used in the production of beer? I am not sure whether he said that we used seeded hops, seedless hops, or whatever. As I understand, in the production of beer we are one of the few countries which use the female hop which has been seeded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both seeded and seedless hops are used. Misunderstanding sometimes arises because some people think that male hops can he used for making beer. As the hon. Member knows, both seeded and seedless hops are used, but largely because of the new varieties which have been evolved, it is more commercial and economic to grow seedless hops. That is the purpose behind the measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0171">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>299</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for his explanation and, in particular, for the fact that he has been able to step into the shoes of the Minister of State at short notice. He may not have considered all the arguments perhaps as fully as the Minister might have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the amendment may be ill-phrased—I thought I said that at the outset—and that nine square miles might not be a suitable measurement. But the purpose—it was done on some advice—was to enable a sizeable area to be allocated by the Minister in an order or series of orders and to prevent the Minister from relying merely on this Bill in making a number of orders which would in due course cover the whole country without the necessity to come back to the House for statutory authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
T appreciate the Minister's point. It is quite clear from the way the Bill is phrased that orders must be laid before the House and the House will in future be able to oppose the extension of these areas. But one must be realistic about it. The Parliamentary Secretary knows as well as I do that these orders will come in at some late hour after 10 o'clock, and one knows that that is not productive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Gentleman is doing the House an injustice. Is he suggesting that when these orders are laid and made, despite the fact that hon. Members are given a considerable period, usually 40 days, within which to table a prayer and oppose the order, hon. Members interested in hop growing and whose constituents are concerned about these matters do not take the trouble to go to the Vote Office to discover what orders have been laid?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am going by the track record, and we all know what that is. But once there is statutory authority for a succession of orders one knows very well that at a late hour these orders do not get rescinded. We know perfectly well that the whip and his colleagues will see to it that a muster of goodly people will go into the Lobby and will not take a few minutes off to stop at the Vote Office and digest exactly what they are voting about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be realistic. Once this statu
	<span class='label label-info column'>300</span>
tory authority is given to the Minister, the whole of England and Wales could be subject to a succession of orders and the "area"—to use the word in the Bill—could be the whole of England and Wales. If we are not realistic about that, we shall not be realistic about anything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Might I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary that in the place of a measurement such as square miles one might have Ordnance Survey measurements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: References.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or references; I am grateful to my hon. Friend. That surely would be a suitable way of measuring the area that is intended. After all, it must be set out in the first order somehow. One must have some kind of measurement inserted in the first order, unless the Minister will be so bold as to take in the whole of England and Wales. But, assuming that he will have just one small bite of the cherry, he has to resort at some time to a measure. I suggest that the kind of measure he has in mind for his order could be inserted in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary said that male hops are not used in brewing. I know only one part of the brewery business, but I am surprised at that in view of what was said on Second Reading. My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Crouch), who was supported by my hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone (Mr. Wells) both of whom represent hop growing areas, spoke of the distinctive flavour of the male hop and how those who liked the taste of certain quality beers might be dependent upon the use of the male hop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope therefore that the Parliamentary Secretary has his facts right. No doubt he has been carefully advised in this matter, but, in the light of that contradiction. I should be grateful and others outside the Committee would be grateful if he could ascertain just what the position is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the Parliamentary Secretary spoke of experiments. I made a mistake when moving the amendment. The Minister did not suggest it was an experiment. He did not use that phrase. My hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Mr. Hamilton), who is a member of the Hops Marketing Board, used the word "experiments" when he said:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>301</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The experiments are limited to isolated areas within Hampshire."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st December 1975; Vol. 901, 	<i>c.</i> 1333.]</p></blockquote>
Therefore, some of us were under the impression that the Hops Marketing Board had continuing experiments in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Costain, may I have your guidance? Would it be in order during the discussion on the amendment to have a debate on the situation relating to the brewing industry and beer? The subject has already been raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Those remarks were strictly out of order. Reference in passing is quite in order, but not to how beer is brewed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to go into that, but I must declare an interest as non-executive Chairman of CAMRA Real Ale Investments, which is an up-and-coming company in the brewing industry. I am concerned about the effect that Clause 5 will have upon the availability of seeded hops—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not discussing Clause 5; we are discussing the area of nine square miles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was just coming to that. The area of nine square miles and the eradication, in certain areas, of the male hop and the limitation that eradication will have upon the supply of hops to the brewing industry should be discussed under this amendment. That is the matter to which I wish to direct the Committee's attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be more appropriate to discuss that matter on the "clause stand part" debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case, perhaps I can speak later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The area of nine square miles in my hon. Friend's amendment puzzles me. It is some time since I was involved in mathematics. Indeed, my university course led to the only science degree where a knowledge of mathematics was totally unnecessary, which is probably the only reason I succeeded in the course. But my hon. Friend is in difficulty with the figure of nine square miles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that to grow effec-
	<span class='label label-info column'>302</span>
tively seedless hops without danger of pollination, there has to be a guarantee that no male hops will be grown within three miles. The figure of three miles is critical because that is the area over which the seeds can be pollinated. Remembering the old formula of TTr2, which will no doubt cause HANSARD apoplexy, for a hop garden growing seedless hops to be three miles from any male hops being grown would require a surrounding area of 28 square miles—working it out rather quickly—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Ellis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That depends whether it is an oblong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a pure circle from an area in the centre. We ought to be thinking in terms of much larger areas than that suggested by my hon. Friend. He is on a perfectly fair point which should have the Government's attention about whether Parliament should say, "We give you the right to designate these areas for the production of seedless hops, but there ought to be some control over how big each area should be." It does not matter whether one calls it square miles, acres, hectares or what, because if one has a designated area of so many square miles I should have thought that it could take on extraordinary shapes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An area of so many square miles does not have to be absolutely square. It can cover all sorts of contours and lines of natural geographic features. There might be a case, however, for saying that the area should be limited in size for every order which is laid. It would help the Committee if the Parliamentary Secretary would comment on that matter, and confirm that the areas would have to be much larger than nine square miles if they were to be effective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I think that all hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body), now recognise that to restrict the area to nine square miles would be impracticable. One point that the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) did not properly make was that there will almost certainly be more than one hop garden in a designated area. Therefore, it is not just a question of one little hop
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0173">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>303</span>
garden where no male hops will be grown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is something that the industry has asked for. Therefore, there is no question but that the Government would be doing this in a sensible and intelligent way in consultation with the industry itself. There is also no question but that male hops will continue to be grown, and that there will still be a large production of seeded hops. What we are talking about is simply creating certain designated areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the hon. Member has raised a fair point that conceivably under this legislation the Government are taking power to designate an enormous area—perhaps the whole of England and Wales—as a seedless hops growing area. My immediate inclination is to say that it is unnecessary to put a limit in here, because I am sure that there is no question of any Government ever seeking to do that against the wishes of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in recognition of what hon. Members have said, I undertake to look again at the practicality of putting in an upper limit. It would be one which would have to give the Government maximum flexibility. But it would meet the hon. Gentleman's point that at least there would he a maximum area which could be designated by one order. I am happy to look at that matter again and to let the hon. Gentleman know how we feel about it on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary has made an important concession. It strikes me, purely as an amateur reading through the clause, that there may he some defect in the drafting. There is great emphasis throughout on "the order". The sense. nevertheless, is nerhans a series of orders. However, it is well worth looking at the matter again. I have reservations—I do not want to explore them now—that links the point that I am making merely 	<i>en passant</i> as regards subsection (4) in terms of the revoking and variation of subsequent orders. We shall come to that later, but the specific wording here is perhaps too restrictive in terms of " the order".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. The draftsman might reply to my hon. Friend to the effect that where
	<span class='label label-info column'>304</span>
the phrase "the order" has been inserted it follows the expression "an order", and that, therefore, the definite article relates to the order that has been made. It is for the Minister, not for me, to give reassurance about that. However, in view of what the Minister was good enough to say, I shall not press the matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 25, in page 5, line 30, after "organisations", insert "and individuals".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment follows remarks which I made on Second Reading, in column I288 of HANSARD for 1st December, and concerns the way in which the Minister goes about establishing the orders. I say straight away that I have no objection to the aim of the clause. It is a thoroughly sensible commercial decision that growers have come to, and have persuaded the Government to take this approach as well, that areas used for the growth of seedless hops are good for the industry and for the country's economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hesitate to quote again what I said on Second Reading, but I suggest that it is important that the areas which are designated are those in which there is the widest possible consent of these concerned with growing hops in those areas. I can think nothing more infuriating for a number of hop growers in an area to be forced against their will to move over to the production of seedless hops. There might be good, commercial reason for doing it overall, but when we consider matters such as these in Parliament we should bear in mind the interests of individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I hope that the only areas which are designated are those in respect of which there is a good deal of consent by hop growers before the programme begins."</p></blockquote>
At that moment the Minister was good enough to say "Certainly", which appears on the record. I responded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I welcome the Minister's statement."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st December 1975; Vol. 901, c. 1288.]</p></blockquote>
I used the words "hop growers" at that stage advisedly, and I was conscious that line 30 on page 5 of the Bill refers to "consultation with such organisa-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0174">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>305</span>
tions". From our experience, we all know that often, while organisations might represent the bulk of growers, they need not necessarily represent everyone. It is the minority of growers with whose attitude I am most concerned. We cannot overestimate the need to have as wide consent as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, as the Minister agreed with me and allowed his view to go on the record on Second Reading, when I referred to "hop growers" rather than "hop growers' organisations", I hope that the Government will accept the amendment, which seeks to add the words "and individuals" after "organisations". That would allow everyone in those areas to know that their views would be understood and taken into account before the order was made. The Minister should find the amendment acceptable. It would give an additional safeguard by which individual people growing hops in certain proposed designated areas would have their views considered, and they would then be more likely to accept the Government's proposals with good grace. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain. I cannot recall how we disposed of the previous amendment. My hon. Friend wished to withdraw it. I think, but was it formally withdrawn?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful if I responded quickly now, because I fully understand and sympathise with the concern of individual hop growers in any area which will be designated for the growing of seedless hops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) already provides an opportunity to individuals to object to a proposed order. However, we recognise the distinction which the hon. Gentleman has drawn between individuals and organisations and are happy to accept the amendment in principle, so that those commercial growers in a proposed designated area who are known to us are individually consulted at the outset. I hope that the hon. Member will agree to withdraw the amendment on the understanding that the Government will table an amendment on Report to meet the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is excelling
	<span class='label label-info column'>306</span>
himself this morning. There should be a lesson here. When some of his perhaps more exalted companions are here, we do not seem to make much progress.I hope that we shall have many more mornings when the Parliamentary Secretary will be in charge of the Bill because we seem to make much better progress when he is here. I am happy to accept his undertaking, but I gather that my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) wishes to say something.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to my hon. Friend. I shall not detain the Committee unduly. I am grateful to the Minister for what he has said because this is an important matter of principle which we should apply in many other cases. Consultation ought to occur before notification of an order. Consultation before makes the whole process go much more smoothly afterwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not just the well-known hop growing areas that have an interest in hops. Norfolk, for example, grows a quantity of hops for replanting. Such areas are not hop growing areas for commercial purposes where hops are picked, but they grow hops for planting out in other districts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that in consultations—though it will not affect the area—the growers of plants will not be forgotten.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. In view of what the Minister has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 26, in page 6, line 8, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(5) Within three years of the order having been made, the Minister shall revoke the order unless, after consultation with such organisations as appear to him appropriate as representing persons carrying on in the area the business of growing hops, he is satisfied that the order should continue in effect."</p></blockquote>
I dare not believe that the Parliamentary Secretary's concessionary spirit of mind will overlap into this amendment, but I hope that he will be sympathetic to the amendment.

I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will take the opportunity that the amendment affords of making a clear statement so that all hop growers, where
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0175">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>307</span>
ever they may be in England and Wales—including that area of Norfolk where I suppose they have to grow a few hops because they cannot make a success of growing the produce that we grow over the border in Lincolnshire—will understand precisely what is in the Minister's mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise, as my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) has indicated, that this measure has the support of hop growers. I am doubtful whether we should generalise about hop growers. Obviously not all hop growers have been consulted. Obviously there is concern about it. Indeed, if it were not for that concern, these amendments would not have been tabled by me. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will make absolutely clear what is the purpose of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the reasons I emphasise this is that my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Mr. Hamilton)—who is a member of the Hops Marketing Board and knows as much about the subject as any of our colleagues in the House—said on Second Reading in an intervention:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The basic underlying reason for this measure is to improve the export potential of British hops, and there is nothing else to it."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st December 1975; Vol. 901, 	<i>c.</i> 1334.]</p></blockquote>
If that is so, surely there is a case for this amendment. It seems intolerable that restrictions should be imposed upon any kind of agriculture or horticulture, especially when experiments may take place in future to improve seeds or methods or culture, and so on, unless there is a need for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is true that this measure is needed for export potential, we should know within three years whether it will be justified. At the end of, say, three years—if the Minister does not think that long enough, I should be willing to add another two or three years, making the period five or six years—the Minister should look again at this restriction upon the liberty of horticulturists and farmers to see whether the restriction is really necessary for the reason that was given for its introduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am arguing against a permanent infringement a liberty, albeit a not very
	<span class='label label-info column'>308</span>
important liberty. I hope, however, that we all recognise that no liberty is unimportant. In this House we cheerfully give these ministerial powers and very cheerfully they are used by a succession of Ministers. The volumes of statutory instruments now add up to a horrifying number. Once they get into a volume, they never seem to get out again. One must look ahead, ten, 20 years hence, at the present rate of progress, if progress it be. We are churning out delegated legislation at a horrifying rate. I repeat that very few instruments are removed from the Statute Book. It all adds to the difficulties of those who have to try to keep within the law and advise others about their obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that it is a small point, and I do not seek to inflame it into anything bigger. Nor do I want to start talking about matters of principle. But if professional advice is to be given by lawyers, auctioneers, valuers, and so on, whose task is to advise farmers about what they should and can do, it is important that restrictions imposed upon agriculture should be in such a compass as to be comprehended by professional advisers. If we go on churning out statutory instruments at the present horrifying rate—I regret to say that the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is as prolific as any Government Department—there is a real risk that it will become intolerable, not this year or next year, but ten, 20 or 30 years hence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure may be necessary, it may be widely supported by the hop-growing industry, but the fact remains that it may not be necessary in years to come. In perhaps three, six or more years, a time may come when it will no longer be necessary. Therefore, there should be a point at which the Minister should be required by the authority that this statute gives him to consider whether it should continue. He should be called upon to revoke it at a certain time unless he is quite sure, after consultation, that this power over hop growers is no longer necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has ventilated a most interesting point. It is another aspect of the amendment which I should like to explore with the Minister. The amendment prescribes not merely the period of time but a consultation procedure. What concerns me here is the wording of subsection (4) in lines
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0176">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>309</span>
7 and 8 on page 6. The Minister may well take refuge in these words in reply. The wording is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"may be revoked or varied by a subsequent order so made."</p></blockquote>
That, of course, would be discretionary. My hon. Friend is trying to impose a duty periodically. But in line with the proposed periodic duty there is also a consultative process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that in the Bill as drafted the revocation or variation by a subsequent order "so made", as we read in lines 7 and 8, is one so made in terms of it being laid and following a certain procedure through both Houses of Parliament, and does not embrace and comprehend the preceding consultative steps that the Minister envisages in the introduction of an order. In other words, his machinery now for revocation and variation stands on a different basis from the introduction to the initiation of an order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have been able to make that point reasonably clearly to the Parliamentary Secretary. If I have it wrong no doubt he will tell me, but I think that I have it right. The wording "so made" is linked not to the preceding subsection but expressly to proceedings in both Houses of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand the thinking of both the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) and the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) in wanting to ventilate this matter. I agree with a great deal of what the hon. Member for Holland with Boston said with regard to the great mass of secondary legislation going through the House, but it is inherent in a modern civilised society and the sort of agricultural policies we seek to pursue in Britain, whether it be disease control or measures such as this. My own feeling is that such matters should be considered when we are discussing devolution—not just to Scotland and Wales but perhaps to English provincial assemblies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that it would be wrong for me to dwell very long on that more general matter, Mr. Costain, but perhaps I can say to the hon. Member for Holland with Boston that it is conceivable, but perhaps unlikely, that in future there may no longer be a demand for seedless hops. It may be that new varieties will come out—although I do not think
	<span class='label label-info column'>310</span>
that anybody expects this—which no longer put such a premium on the hop being seedless. That matter is recognised, and is why it is written into the clause that any designated area can be revoked in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One important matter to be recognised is that the effect of the amendment would be to subject commercial growers in designated areas to an extended period of uncertainty. The decision to seek to produce seedless hops and to request an order to this end will be taken only by the growers concerned after full consideration. Once the decision has been taken and they have obtained an order, they need to be assured and to be able to assure their customers of continuity of supplies. It would be inappropriate for a commercial exercise of this nature to be subject to unnecessary uncertainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason above all, I should be unhappy writing in that the order would automatically fall, or that it would automatically have to be renewed, after a three-year or four-year period. Hon. Members will acknowledge that whenever that is done people assume that something will only last for that period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One example is the beef regime, where beef was secured for one year. The Government intended that it should be a long-term achievement. But opponents of the Community and the Government said that it was for one year only. We will know by the end of February who was right. My guess is that the Government will secure the beef for more than one year. However, it is important to avoid uncertainty for an area designated for seedless hops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the point raised by the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge. It is an important and basically technical drafting point whether a
	<br><blockquote><p>"statutory instrument subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament, and may be revoked or varied by a subsequent order so made"</p></blockquote>
embodies the consultative exercise which preceded the initial enactment of the order. The advice I received is that it does. Subsections (2) and (3) relate to orders under this subsection as well as to the original order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hestitate to argue with the Parliamentary Secretary over terms
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0177">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>311</span>
of drafting, but I would relate the operative words "order so made" in line 8 to "shall be made" in line 5. There is a direct relationship between the two phrases. In talking of revocation or variation
	<br><blockquote><p>"by a subsequent order so made",</p></blockquote>
one's mind goes back to line 5 where it states that the order shall be made by a parliamentary procedure. That has no reference at all to the preceding consultations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has a fair point and the best way to resolve it is for the Government to take advice on the matter and to assure him yet again, as I do now, that the clause will make it mandatory for consultations to take place before an annulment order can be laid. The advice I have received is that his point is covered. However, I will look at it again, giving him a definitive answer and a full justification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 27, in Page 6, line I3, leave out from "within" to "such" and insert "six calendar months".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will regard this as a reasonable and fair amendment. As the Bill is drafted, the Minister may specify only a short period of time, which might be quite inadequate to enable a hop grower to eliminate his male hop plants. I am not suggesting that the Minister will be wilfully unreasonable and stipulate the minutes or hours, instead of weeks or months. But I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will understand that the rooting up of the male hop plant will be a matter of major importance for a large number of growers. I do not think that my hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone (Mr. Wells) was wholly facetious when he said that one would need a JCB to do the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not talking about small plants that can be easily eradicated with a bit of poison, or a hoe or even a fork tool. The hop plant has very deep roots, and if the hop grower is to avoid committing any offence under these regulations a major operation will need to be carried out in order to eradicate it. It will de-
	<span class='label label-info column'>312</span>
mand tools which the hop grower may not possess. In an area there may be a considerable demand upon the requisite tackle and the contractors who have the tackle available may be in considerable demand. It may not be feasible for the hop grower who is anxious to cooperate and willing to conform with the law as best he can to eradicate these hop plants unless a generous length of time is given for the task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that six months is too long a period in the opinion of the Hops Marketing Board, which wants to get on with the job. The board uses words like " urgent " and " extremely urgent ", as if male hops were spreading some terrible contagious disease. In certain areas we want to eliminate male hop plants, and if it is not done in the first year, it will not be all that serious, despite what the Hops Marketing Board says. If they were eliminated in two years from now in the areas that we have in mind, that should be quite enough. It would enable the work that the Hops Marketing Board wants to do to succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I urge a very generous length of time to enable those hop growers to do the job which will be passed on to them. The Minister of State said last week that hop growers want this Bill. He said that it was all being done with their co-operation, and that there was a degree of pressure for the Minister to introduce Clause 5. If that be so, he must assume that he will have the co-operation of the hop growers, particularly in those areas where the first orders are to be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend indicate what is the cost or estimated cost—if any there be—of the eradication or destruction of a hectare of male hops? He mentioned the JCB excavator. As you, Mr. Costain, are well aware, the hire of such a machine is extremely costly—many pounds per hour. I should like to know whether the Government or my hon. Friend have made an estimate of the cost of eradicating an area of male hops.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It must cost hundreds of pounds to eliminate male hop plants in a hectare. I am sorry we have lapsed into this language. I wish we could have retained the acre a little longer, until this Bill became law. My hon. Friend the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>313</span>
Member for Maidstone said that the tools that would be used would cost about £4.50, £5 or £5.50 an hour, depending on how far the tackle had to be moved. If one is to eliminate a hectare of male hops, clearly it would cost hundreds—perhaps thousands—of pounds. The hop growers will have to spend a considerable sum of money for this purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the realisation that the Minister is not suggesting any compensation for these hop growers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my hon. Friend, in telling us this story of the male hop, could say how many acres of male hops there are in this country? What is the proportion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot help my hon. Friend. I represent Lincolnshire, not Norfolk. In Lincolnshire we do not grow weeds like hops. We do not grow weeds at all. Therefore, I have not such authority to speak about hops as I might have if I represented part of Norfolk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand, the difficulties of eliminating the male hop will be quite considerable. Any order that is made will place quite a burden on the hop growing industry. In these days of rapidly increasing costs—anyone who has had to engage a contractor for any kind of farm improvement will know that costs have doubled in the past two years—we are expecting hop growers to incur considerable expense. In most cases they will have to borrow the money, involving negotiation with the bank manager, and that takes time—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are talking about an amendment relating to the period of six calendar months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was arguing that hop growers will incur considerable expense in excavating these plants. They must find the money before they incur debts with the contractors. It may take some time to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Committee to take the view that six months is not an unreasonable time in which to call upon the hop grower not just to eradicate the plants—it is a lot more than that: to arrange for the work to be done, get an estimate for the work, find the money for that purpose, then arrange for the labour and equipment to be assembled. All these matters take time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>314</span>
If it were a matter of just one hop grower in an area, he might be able to do it quite rapidly. But if the order is to extend to quite a large area, from what we gathered from the arithmetic of my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling)—at which I marvelled; if he is no good at arithmetic, goodness knows what a distinguished degree he must have taken at the university—if it be some falling number of square miles—I forget what the calculation was, but it was many square miles—it must follow that probably a large number of hop growers will be called upon to carry out the eradication of hop plants at the same time. It may be difficult for them to conform to the law, which they would wish to do, in less than six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As there is no real emergency, despite the words of the Hops Marketing Board, we can take our time. If it is done in a couple of years, and no one will really be hurt, I should have thought that it was quite proper to insert a period such as six months to enable hop growers to be able to carry out the task without having the length of time made oppressive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body). He has raised an important point. It is easy for the Government and Government draftsmen to put a clause on paper, not fully realising the cost of what they are putting in writing and instructing people to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been clearly stated—I am sure you, Mr. Costain, from your experience of the construction industry, are aware of the cost of hiring machinery—the excavating, destroying or otherwise removing of a large area of male hops will take a considerable time and cost a considerable sum of money. I hope that the reasonable request of my hon. Friend will be met by the Minister. Failing that, I hope that he will come forward with a statement or an assurance that this matter will be considered before Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have experience of the construction industry and I am appalled that in the clause, which we are trying to amend responsibly, the Government have not made any estimate or gone to any trouble to appreciate the cost to many farmers
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>315</span>
of eradicating male hops. It is an important point. The country is not in the best economic situation and yet the Government are foisting heavy costs upon people with no provision to pay grant or compensation, seemingly. They are expected, when perhaps they are not making much profit, to go to their bank managers to ask for heavy loans to meet a commitment placed upon them by the Govenment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not ask the Government—because of my concern for public expenditure—to make money available for this purpose, but I ask the Under-Secretary and the Government to meet this constructive amendment. Failing that, I hope that the Minister in replying to the amendment, will give a clear indication that before Report the Government will endeavour to meet the meaning behind my hon. Friend's amendment which I consider is very responsible and correct. It would have been wrong if the Opposition had not raised this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister to reply to some practical questions. I should like to know how many acres of male hops are grown in this country? What proportion is it of the total acreage? Do some hop growers have nothing but male hops or the larger proportion? It seems to me that the cost to someone who has to destroy—I presume this means grubbing up, burning or otherwise disposing—will be far more harsh upon a grower who has a large proportion of his crop within the definition of "male hops", because he has to replant with the seedless hops which would be an additional large expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister give the information I am asking for in as much detail as he can so that we may have some idea of the sort of problem which will face growers as a whole and individually? Is there a Government grant? I do not believe there is, and I should like confirmation of that. In most cases, such as grubbing up old apple orchards, Government grants have been paid in the past and I should like to know whether some help will be given, possibly through the Hops Marketing Board, to help those people who might find themselves in a situation where the vast majority of their hops will be put out of action, leaving them with a small acreage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>316</span>
This is a matter which needs more probing. These hoards and any official body believe—we do ourselves when it is of some interest to ourselves—that any matter which we consider and which we have to deal with is the most important and urgent matter. I cannot think but that my hon. Friend's amendment would do anything but good. I wonder whether it proposes a long enough time, but possibly it does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree very much with what my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) has said. The Committee is in difficulty in that the majority of us are not as expert in the life cycle of the hop as we might like to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful if the Minister would explain what is involved in removing a male hop plant and to what extent this is a major civil engineering matter—I am sure it is not. As I understand it, there are difficulties in this matter because I gather that when it is growing early in the season it is very difficult to tell whether a hop plant is male or female. I understand that it is not until May or June that the difference becomes apparent. I am thinking particularly of wild hops, which grow in hedgerows or on waste land, which are referred to in subsection (5). That is where the greatest difficulty is likely to arise, if we have an area designated and created—if the Minister retains his conciliatory and hopeful attitude—with the general agreement and acceptance of hop growers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that the greatest danger under subsection (5) arises in odd areas which are outside hop gardens. I gather that hops grow frequently outside hop gardens. Recently a constituent of mine in the Lake District found hops growing in a hedgerow there. As an ex-senior employee of the Hops Marketing Board. he recognised the plant. The North of England and Westmorland is a long way from the major hop growing areas. I imagine a hop was blown off a lorry which was taking a load of hops to the breweries in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. I suppose it landed by the side of the road and grew. Therefore, within the hop growing areas, quite a lot of wild plants grow in places which are adjacent to the hop gardens. That is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0180">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>317</span>
where the major difficulty is likely to arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thinking about how long people should have to remove male hops, I can see the difficulty that the Hops Marketing Board has suggested. If one does not know until May or June that a male hop exists and one waits six months, that may be too late. It may be that the plant has done all the damage. It is rather like a ram in a field of sheep or a bull breaking into a field of cows. If one has to wait six months to find out who the bull belongs to, the damage has been done and one might just as well not bother to find out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty that will arise over taking action to get rid of male hops is what will happen and what will be involved when they are found growing in a hedgerow. If a male hop is found growing in a hedgerow, it will be important to know how it can be removed. Is it just pulled out by the roots by hand or does one have to dig it out, as was suggested earlier?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subsection is quite explicit in the case of unoccupied land, but what is the position with common land, which is a rather different matter? There are vast acreages of common land in the countryside and I would expect to find within the hop growing areas considerable quantities of common land. Do legal procedures exist whereby rogue male hops growing on common land can be dealt with fairly quickly? The subsection refers to " unoccupied land " and says that notice must be served on the person entitled to occupy it. But on common land that cannot be done because in many cases there could be hundreds of people—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is covered by Amendment No. 30.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg your pardon, Mr. Costain My mind was working on the way this might be tackled in terms of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain. I am doubtful about that, because Amendment No. 30 merely covers a defence for somebody who has received a notice and who has failed to act accordingly.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is correct, and with regard to the occupier, if male hops were to be found growing on common land and the Minister had to serve a notice on all persons who were entitled to occupy that common land, I should have thought this could give rise to major difficulties. My hon. Friend is on a good point, but Amendment No. 30 raises rather a different matter to which we might return.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have explained how difficult it is to separate the amendments from the clauses. On the previous clause, I gave a ruling that we shall have a debate on the "clause stand part" question.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, Mr. Costain. It might give the Minister time to seek advice, because this point is very important. I am sure the Minister has a good deal of information which will help the Committee enormously. We should then be able to consolidate our attitude when we have heard what he has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that it is true to say that hon. Gentlemen are seeking deliberately to prolong the debate. I agree that it is important that we try to confine the debates to the amendments and be reasonably consistent with what the amendment is about, particularly if we are to have a "clause stand part" debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall confine my reply to the relevant points which have been raised in relation to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sole purpose of the clause is to facilitate the growing of seedless hops by preventing the pollination of female plants. If accepted, the amendment would frustrate this purpose. The male hop—the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) has pointed this out—can be positively identified only for a brief period at flowering time when effective action must be taken urgently if the release of pollen is to be prevented. The delays which would arise from acceptance of this amendment would make it highly probable that pollen would be released with consequent effects on the seed content of plants in hop gardens in the vicinity, with possibly substantial
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0181">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>319</span>
financial loss to the grower or growers concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In passing, I might mention that when the consultative exercise has taken place preceding the laying of the order and the designation of the area, then growers would have an opportunity to object. If there were large areas containing male hops, that factor would form a ground for objection to the laying of the order, as would be the cost involved. Hon. Members must realise that, basically, male hops exist in gardens with female hops in the ratio of about one male to 200 females. Furthermore, the most likely way of tackling the problem would be through the use of herbicides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of cost, I point out that seedless hops command a premium today. Therefore, those growers who go over from seeded to seedless hops in the designated areas would, as a result of the change, be marketing a product which, in general, commands a small premium price.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not true, too, that seedless hops tend to give a lower yield than seeded hops?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but they have a higher yield of the active ingredient, which is what counts. When I talk about yield, I mean it in the proper sense, namely, in terms of the actual value of the output per hectare or per acre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn briefly to the question of common land. We expect that problem to be tackled mainly by the hop growers themselves. Hon. Members should remember that the incentive and demand for this to be tackled would come from the designated area hop growers, some of whom might already be trying to grow seedless hops, therefore we should expect them to play their part in eradicating male hops from common land. The whole exercise will be done in cooperation with the Ministry, and if necessary Ministry officials will help and, in the last analysis, will remove male hops from common ground. It would be impractical to write in the words "six months", as sought in the amendment. If, notwithstanding all the advance notices and warnings that a grower has had, we find that there are still male hops in isolated gardens, as becomes clear in subsection (6), Ministry officials would themselves move in and do the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>320</span>
I think that hon. Members are inclined to view the matter in terms of confrontation between the Ministry and unwilling hop growers. I am convinced that the areas will be so chosen that it will be a totally voluntary and collective effort. Instead of the Ministry working against the growers, it will be working with the growers. As I have said already, it would make complete nonsense of the clause if we were to accept the amendment. I hope that the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body), in the light of remarks made by me and also by his hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling), will withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Parliamentary Secretary used the kind of adjectives which seem to come regularly from the Hops Marketing Board. He said that it is urgent that male hops should be eliminated. That may be so, but I suggest that the Minister should give us an idea of what notice will be given to hop growers, or what notice those growers will get who happen to have, like the constituent of my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling), a hop plant growing accidentally. We ought to be given some idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that the matter is urgent, and that something will have to be done urgently if one of those terrible things, a male hop, is about. According to the Hops Marketing Board the flowering period is in late spring and early summer. Therefore, I imagine that at least a few weeks would occur during which a male hop could be detected. Even if it was detected at first flowering, there would still be several weeks in which to give some notice. If it was detected only at the end of the flowering period, the period of notice would have to be merely a week or two. Injustice could be caused to someone who, quite accidentally, was growing one or more male hop plants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that we are faced with the issue of urgency against justice. I do not want to over-play the justice angle, but if people are to keep within the law, and a change in the law, some notice of it must be given It may prove to be oppressive to a few individuals, perhaps only one or two or just one, but even one individual is important. Such an individual may not be a professional hop grower but may have some hop plants in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0182">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>321</span>
his garden or on his farm, and suddently he may be told at short notice that he is to eliminate them, and that if he does not he is committing a crime. The person might be acting in good faith, and wishes to conform to the law, and such action would be unjust to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that the Parliamentary Secretary will indicate the period he has in mind, if that is not to be six months. Presumably he is thinking of a period much less than six months in view of his remark that this is a wrecking amendment—he did not actually use that phrase but he got near to it. He said that it was impractical, which I submit is the same as saying that it is unworkable and therefore wrecking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman inferred that the Opposition were suggesting that a confrontation was being set up. "Confrontation "is a strong word to use, but perhaps it is not altogether inappropriate in this case. A law needs to be passed only to make people do something which otherwise they would not do naturally. There would be no need for this legislation, no need for Clause 5 at all, if all those who had hops on their land wanted only female hops. But the Minister is satisfied, and the Hops Marketing Board is certainly satisfied, that a subtantial number of people have male hops and may go on growing them, either deliberately or accidentally, and that in order to coerce them into getting rid of them—"coercion" is the right word—we must have legislation and create a new crime, and make it a criminal offence to grow male hops in certain areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to create a new crime, and punish offending growers by a fine of £100 or whatever the amount may be, we should give people a reasonable amount of notice to enable them to conform with the law. Therefore, the Minister should be forthcoming and tell us how much notice he considers reasonable in these cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept part of the Parliamentary Secretary's explanation. There is no doubt that a great deal of warning to hop growers, if "warn
	<span class='label label-info column'>322</span>
ing" is the correct word to choose, will be given during the consultation period. The Minister rightly pointed out that any hop grower, be it an organisation or an individual, will have the opportunity to register a firm objection which might affect the outcome of whether a particular area is to be designated a seedless hops area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, while the Minister indicated that approximately one hop plant out of 200 was male, he did not indicate whether the Government had made an estimate of what approximately would be the cost of removing, destroying, digging up, excavating—here I use the description used by my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body)—an acre, not a hectare, of hop garden. It is important that some estimate of the cost to the industry should have been made. That is my sole reason for intervening on this amendment. Can the Minister give any estimate of the cost involved to the hop industry in designating a certain area seedless?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give an estimate of the cost. We are hoping that these areas will include few male hops, and that there will be little need for the removal of male hops. However, if the hon. Member wants some detailed attempt at figuring the cost of removing the old hops, say, from a hectare of female hops which includes male hops, I shall write to him and try to provide him with some figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) has acknowledged that because of the nature of this operation there will be occasions when we shall be able only to give a few days notice. Therefore, the best I can do for him—he will recognise that this is important—is to say that we shall ensure that the actual consultation and advertising which precedes the designation of an area, when growers will have an opportunity to object, will be as elaborate and as substantial as possible. That will enable the people in the area, in so far as it is practical to achieve it, will know well in advance that it will no longer be within the law for them to allow male hops to grow on the land, or at least that they may be liable to an order asking them to remove them. The best thing that we can do is to ensure that very

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 28, in page 6, line 17, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(6) The regular cropping of the new growths for eating as hop tips shall be deemed to be adequate prevention of pollination".</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Committee will detect the Kentish influence in observing the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone (Mr. Wells) attached to the amendment, and may be persuaded, therefore, that it comes from a source well equipped to give a little advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that hop tips are now eaten to some extent—I have not tasted them myself—as a delicacy. A number of horticulturists are engaged in this kind of horticultural production. I do not think that it is very profitable, but not many forms of horticulture are at the moment. I will not dwell on that matter, Mr. Costain, because it would be out of order, but horticulturists nowadays must constantly be looking for new crops, new varieties and new forms of production, and a number have sought to go into this kind of venture. I hope, therefore, that the Minister does not intend to require Parliament to take a course which will prevent this modest branch of the horticultural industry from earning a few extra pennies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am assured—perhaps the Minister has been advised by ADAS on this—that if this form of horticulture is pursued and there is regular cropping of new growths, there can be no fear of pollination. Therefore, there is no threat from the terrible male hop that Parliament is now determined to rid the country of. I hope that the Minister will be able to agree to the amendment to enable this small part of horticulture to continue in existence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) has not been able to provide us with all the details of the various ways by which hop tips are consumed. This is a matter of some interest to my hon. Friends and to me. Many of us have not had an opportunity to savour this delicacy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no question of the Government preventing this section of hop growing from continuing, but in designated
	<span class='label label-info column'>324</span>
areas it will have to be done by the use of female hops. Obviously, to exempt male hops on the basis of regular cropping of new growths would present considerable inspection difficulties and would put commercial growers of seedless hops at risk. It would be impractical to allow male hops to be grown, even for this purpose, in designated areas. It would not be feasible to police them adequately, and the hon. Member must recognise that female hops can be used for this purpose. I hope, therefore, that he will agree to withdraw the amendment so that we can make some progress with the clause this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I shall not be accused of not trying to make progress. I do not utter a syllable without keeping a close eye on the hon. Gentleman who is concerned about the speed of progress of the Committee. The Opposition are not trying to dwell on any of these matters and spending any more time than is necessary on them. That is why I have tried to move these amendments expeditiously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I regret the use of the word "police". We are elevating the male hop to a criminal status which I feel it hardly deserves. I suspect that some briefs have been coming from the Hops Marketing Board. I have received some, and appalling adjectives are used in them—for example, the word " urgent " apparently cannot be used unless it is followed by "repeat, urgent" as if it is absolutely desperate to rid Britain of the male hop because it is doing something appalling, far worse than any bull getting among the cattle or among the cows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry, also, that the Parliamentary Secretary used the word "impractical". We are concerned with preventing the male hop from pollinating. If this form of horticulture is being pursued, there can be no possible risk of pollination. There would be no risk of the male hop doing its dirty work and upsetting the ambitions of the Hops Marketing Board. I hope, therefore, that we can take not a relaxed view—that would be too much to expect from the Hops Marketing Board—but at least a quieter and more considered view of this matter and not resort to urgency as much as we have. There may be a need for it, but it is not as desperately urgent as we have been told. I regret that horticulturists are to have this very ordinary liberty of theirs

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is that, if the Minister intends to resort to the heavy hand and enter someone's land to carry out work on that man's land at a cost which he will recover from the owner himself, he should give some reasonable notice of his intentions. In the first place, I suggest that there should he 21 days' notice. The Parliamentary Secretary has probably been advised why 21 days' notice should not be accepted. It is not the kind of notice that one would have from the Hops Marketing Board—it would give no notice at all. I am not exaggerating when I say that, because in a memorandum it circulated it went so far as to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is a practical difficulty in requiring any notice".</p></blockquote>
It is quite appalling that a public body should urge Parliament to equip officials with the power to enter somebody's land without any notice whatsoever. I regret that the board expressed its opinion in such a way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary is familiar as to why a period of 21 days has been embodied in the amendment. That is the least period of notice normally given when statutory powers enable others to enter someone's land. I hope he will not say that the male hop is such a dreadful creature that we have to break with precedent and allow a
	<span class='label label-info column'>326</span>
shorter notice than is normal, when many more urgent matters merit 21 days. I hope he will accept the amendment, enabling the occupier of the land to have 21 days' notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the period should not be less than 2I days, and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will acknowledge that most owners and occupiers of land want to be law-abiding. Twenty-one days is a reasonable period, which would enable the individual concerned to consider the implications of the notice, to take advice and find from contractors and those who deal in herbicides the cost of doing the work himself. That would all take a week or two and, as we live in a reasonable society, we can assume that there may be occasions when a notice will not necessarily be read by the farmer immediately. He may be away at a conference or on holiday. I urge the Parliamentary Secretary not to make an exception here and allow less than 2I days notice to be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have added a requirement that the Minister should tell the owner of the land the cost of the work the Minister expects to do. In this notice, the farmer, hop grower or individual householder, who happens to have an erring hop plant in his garden, is told that the Minister and his officials will descend upon his land and take remedial action, whether it be the JCB moving in, or a tin of herbicide we do not know. Certainly, drastic action will be taken to eradicate the male hop from that man's land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the use of herbicide, will the male hop be identified and dealt with, or will the hop grower have to deal with the whole area he is trying to make seedless?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in some doubt about it. The Minister has not been able to tell us. He said that he has it in mind to use herbicides and no doubt he received advice from the ADAS on the matter. But some hop growers doubt whether any herbicide would be effective and that something much more drastic will be necessary. If eradication is required, it must be done to ensure that there is no further damage—my hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone (Mr. Wells) was not being facetious when he spoke of the JCB.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should notify the farmer, horticulturist or householder what cost
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0185">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>327</span>
is likely to be incurred. It seems unjust to tell a householder that the work will be done without notifying him of the cost. It may be very small. If it involves pouring a tin of herbicide over a hop plant even the Ministry could not do that at any great expense. But if the Ministry goes to a major contracting company, which may do it much more cheaply if left to its own devices, and enters into a contract, goodness knows what the cost will be. Surely it is not unreasonable for a notice to specify the estimated cost to be incurred by the Minister so that the landowner may examine the estimate and decide whether he cannot get the work done at a more reasonable cost. In any event, there should be an expressed opinion of the cost of the work if the Ministry move in and do the work for the owner. As matters stand no one will have any idea of the likely cost, which will cause injustice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must re-emphasise that the male hop can only be positively identified in a brief period at flowering time, when effective action must be taken urgently if the release of pollen is to be prevented. The delays which would arise from the acceptance of any of these amendments make it highly probable that pollen is released with consequent effects upon the seed content of plants in hop gardens in the vicinity, with possible substantial financial loss to the growers concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can only assure the hon. Member that the Government will do all they can to see that the scheme is operated in a sensible and amicable way. I hope he will withdraw the amendments because they are impractical so far as the objectives of Clause 5 are concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has used the word "impractical" again.

	<span class='label label-info column'>328</span>
It is quite appalling. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary does not know what he and his officials are confessing. It means that they have no idea what the cost will be either now or later. It is rather serious that he should say it is impractical to disclose the likely cost. The least we should know is the estimated cost of work to be done at the Minister's behest. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will reconsider that word "impractical", because it seems, I repeat, something of a confession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I referred, of course, specifically to the seven and 2I days which are stated in the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must bear in mind that the Ministry will take action almost invariably where a person is in default, having received a notice. I undertake, however, to look before Report at the question of the practicality of advising an occupier of the approximate cost in the unlikely and exceptional event of the Ministry having to do the job itself. We shall consider that matter, and I will inform the hon. Gentleman on Report of the Government's view.

I hope that we shall have no difficulty about this amendment. It merely intends to make clear in the Bill that a person should not be guilty of a crime unless he is aware that he has committed that crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a pig farmer, but I spent 20 years practising at the Bar. Far be it from me to give a dissertation on criminal law, but there used to be a time when the doctrine of 	<i>mens rea</i> was rampant in our criminal courts. In other words, a person could not be found guilty of a crime unless he knew that what he did was a crime. That is not quite the case now, and I am afraid that the House of Com-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0186">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>329</span>
mons has been guilty of introducing various new offences which can be committed even when someone does not know that they are offences. It is contrary to the common law of England and to criminal law of a decade or two ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of new offences are creeping in, often found in statutory instruments, these mischievous items of delegated legislation that the hon. Gentleman is responsible for introducing at sinister hours of the night while others are nodding off. It is regrettable, as I am sure most hon. Members would agree, that people should be charged, let alone convicted, of an offence unless they are conscious of having committed it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sole purpose of the amendment is to set up a defence for the hop grower, the horticulturist, the farmer, even the householder, even the former official of the Hops Marketing Board who lives in Westmorland, the hon. Member for Brigg and Scunthorpe (Mr. Ellis), not to be convicted or fined the sum of £100 or whatever it may be, for doing something of which they are wholly innocent and unaware. Some people might say—it might have been the doctrine of even 20 years ago—that it would not have been necessary to move the amendment, because the then Court of Criminal Appeal would have insisted on the doctrine of 	<i>mens rea</i> and would have said that there was no such thing as an absolute offence and that a person had to have a guilty state of mind before he could be judged guilty. Those days are gone. That is why I submit that it is necessary to insert words such as those in the amendment to enable the doctrine of 	<i>mens rea</i> to survive in this sphere of the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore hope that the Minister will be sympathetic. It would be awful if, in respect of this beastly, dreadful male hop that we have now learned to despise, and the dreadful crime that it may be to keep a male hop on one's land, we should lose the historic doctrine of 	<i>mens rea,</i> and if a person is innocent of any knowledge of having grown this beastly weed 	<i>mens rea</i> may be submitted as a defence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would still be open to the Ministry to prosecute, to have before the
	<span class='label label-info column'>330</span>
magistrates the owner of the male hop, but at least the magistrates would be able to say, "Not guilty" if they were satisfied that the owner of this vicious weed was unaware that he had it in his possession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 5 does not render a person liable to prosecution solely because he has male hops, cultivated or wild, growing on his land. The point is that an offence arises only under subsection (7) when the individual fails to comply with the notice requiring him to remove specified male hop plants within a given time for the purpose of preventing pollination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the hon. Member's attention to subsection (7) which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Without prejudice to the power of proceeding under the preceding subsection, a person who without reasonable excuse fails to comply"</p></blockquote>
I draw the hon. Member's attention to the phrase "without reasonable excuse". It has to be accepted that the circumstances in which the male hop plant came to he on the land is of no relevance to the offence committed. I hope that that explanation will enable the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel that I cannot withdraw the amendment. It might well be that the owner of the offending plant would dislike male hops as much as the general manager of the Hops Marketing Board and be willing to be part of the crusade against this terrible plant. But notwithstanding his own zeal against male hops. he may be abroad on a prolonged holiday. He might be unaware that this plant was growing or that he had received a notice by post from a Ministry official to his home address. He might be a sick man. convalescing in some hospital. He might not receive the letter. All sorts of reasons might prevent him from knowing about this male hop or the notice sent out by the Ministry. The notice might not have been received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
know that the Post Office is the most efficient of all our nationalised organisations, but the post might fail on this one occasion. Such things can and do happen. It may sound eccentric, but there are occasions when people are unaware of notices which have been sent which give rise to injustices. Cases
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0187">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>331</span>
come before the courts from time to time—not often, perhaps only once a year, but they do occur. We need a long-stop to prevent injustice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Parliamentary Secretary could be sure that the notice would be received and that the offending owners of the male hop would know about it, he could argue that the amendment was unnecessary. Experience has shown, however, that this kind of provision is necessary to make sure that no injustice is caused. I hope therefore that the Minister will be good enough to reconsider the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that subsection (7) states "without reasonable excuse", but that would be for the magistrate to decide. The owner of the male hop might have an agent or tenant, or an occupier of the land at that time, or even some relation who was looking after the land who was responsible. Therefore, the innocent owner might be said to have no" reasonable excuse". Such decisions have been made by a magistrates' court, particularly by a busy court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hope that the Minister will accept this amendment in view of his stand on the last one. If people may be convicted of a crime of which they are wholly innocent and unaware, at least they should be able to be fined only £50, not £100. I need not take up any time arguing this amendment. If one looks through the tariffs nowadays for committing crimes, the figure of £50 is more in line with the going rate for offences of this nature.

I emphasise, as best I can, that this very simple amendment is intended to be an assurance that somebody who has acted with complete innocence is not to be punished for something of which he is unaware. That is all the amendment seeks to do. It is a very simple case of doing justice, and I hope that it is a matter which can cross the frontiers within the Committee. There must be hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>333</span>
that much heavier fines are imposed on people who have committed the grave crime of growing the male hop. I hope that a sense of proportion will prevail and that the figure of £50 may be considered more appropriate than a figure of £100.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The maximum fine for failure to comply with a notice served under subsection (5) is £100—I emphasise that £I00 is the maximum. In the event of obstruction of an authorised person which might prevent him from ascertaining that an offence under subsection (7) had been committed it is logical to impose a like penalty for the obstruction. Taking that point into account and that we are talking about a maximum fine and realising that we should accord some sense and responsibility to the magistrates, I hope that the Committee will be able to accept the arguments I have put forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 33, in page 6, line 45, at end add:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(11) This section shall not apply to ornamental varieties of hops growing at a distance of more than 100 yards from any commercial hop garden".</p></blockquote>
This amendment is to enable horticulturists to continue what they are doing at present quite legitimately. It will enable them to go on doing something which will not injure the commercial growing of crops of the female hop. On the amendment, my name is preceeded by that of a Kent Member. my hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone (Mr. Wells). It will be understood that he. rather than I, inspired it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that many horticulturists in Kent, and perhaps beyond that county, who are concerned with growing ornamental grasses, are anxious that this amendment should be accepted. The distance of 100 yards may not be far enough. I gather from the Hops Marketing Board that three miles is the distance—even allowing for that board's rather extravagant use of language concerning the male hop—which is far beyond the I00 yards set out in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Originally, 100 yards was inserted because that was considered a safe distance, for the purpose of pollination, from any growers of the female hop. Those experts in horticulture may be mistaken, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>334</span>
three miles may be the safe distance, not 100 yards. Even if it were three miles, I suggest that there is no reason why one should not insert an amendment to enable those who are growing ornamental hops to continue doing so. I assume that these ornamental varieties are not used in brewing. I understand that those which have existed near female hop gardeners have not caused any pollination and that so far no risk can be established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to confirm that. If not, perhaps he could give the Committee some information—hard fact rather than the frothy opinion with which we have been furnished up to now—about whether there are any hop gardens where the female hop is being cultivated exclusively and where damage has been done as a result of the growing of these ornamental varieties within a distance of, say, three miles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that ornamental hops have a great part to play. I was provided with some ornamental hops by one of the greatest individuals in farming, the late lamented Jack Merricks, whom I believe was a great fighter for freedom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He was a great man and a great farmer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: His death was tragic and many people miss him. He provided me with the sort of hops which I grew as a screen adjoining my house, which was of immense benefit and one of the most delightful things. I grew them for about I0 or 12 years and would hate to think that nobody could grow these hops in future where they wished to do so and as long as they are not causing any harm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will give us some hard facts about the distance at which the obviously very potent male hop can throw the seed. My hon. Friend referred to three miles, not 100 yards. That seems to be a very envious attribute for the male hop. I cannot quite see why it seems to be being treated, according to my hon. Friend as if it were another "Jaws" or some such animal as that. I believe that ornamental hops are grown quite considerably. They are of great benefit to certain people, and I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0189">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>335</span>
hope that they will not be prevented by this clause from being grown.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any male hop, cultivated or wild, of both commercial and ornamental varieties, may cause pollination in a hop garden if it is within the distance that wind-borne pollen may carry. This can be up to three miles. One male hop plant can have an adverse effect on the seed content of a significant number of female hop plants. If the measure is to be effective, no exceptions can be made. Female hop plants grown for ornamental purposes are not affected by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to be helpful, because hon. Members have asked for further information. I understand that the annual Japanese hop, which is among those grown ornamentally, does not readily cross-pollinate. If it transpires that we can be satisfied that such plants do not present a threat in any given circumstance, it will not be necessary to take action under the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman say "annual"? That is not the purpose of the ornamental hop which provides a screen for many years, or can do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Japanese hop is an annual. I am trying to be helpful to hon. Members. I am indicating that we shall not enforce this provision if it is unnecessary. If the biological facts show that there are ornamental male hops which present no risk to seedless hop gardens—I understand that the chances of these hops being in designated areas are pretty slim—I undertake to look at the position. If it can be shown clearly that there is no risk, we will not enforce this provision against these varieties of ornamental hop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member will be willing to withdraw his amendment on the basis of that helpful reply. I am sure he is not trying to saddle us with an amendment which could enable hops, ornamental or otherwise, to be grown which would undermine the whole effect of the clause and make a designation area impracticable and unworkable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, and I shall not press the amendment. But I am a little alarmed that the Minister said that his Department did not propose to
	<span class='label label-info column'>336</span>
enforce these orders. That is strange language. We are creating a new crime—and crime it is—and the Minister will not necessarily prosecute all these crimes. But it is not always upon the Ministry, having introduced a new offence, to enforce it. Other people may be able to do so. If an order has been made, surely others, apart from the Minister, may enforce it. Therefore we are treading on very thin ice when we speak in that language about enforcing an order that has been made by way of a statutory instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think I can say more, but I respectfully protest about the use of the language adopted by the Parliamentary Secretary. He may have done so inadvertently not realising the significance of what he said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the words I used were fairly loose, but the point I was trying to make to clarify the position is that if we can achieve a situation where there are exemptions which do not threaten the purpose of a designation area, we shall endeavour, between now and Report, to establish how such an exemption might be effected. I am not saying that we necessarily accept at this stage that there are instances where it would be practical to make an exemption. We will look at the possibility of whether we can exempt certain varieties of hops. When we try to write such a provision into the legislation, it may prove to be more trouble than it is worth, but I undertake to look at it before Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the first speaker, I remind the Committee that the clause is about the breeding habits of hops, not the drinking habits of humans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will heed your warning, Mr. Costain, but as the refreshment hour approaches I make no apology for directing my remarks to beer, because hops are an important part of the brewing industry. In making my brief contribution I speak on behalf of 30,000-plus members of the Campaign
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0190">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>337</span>
for the Maintenance of Real Ale, the objectives of which are the commercial objectives of the company with which I am associated and about which I declared an interest earlier this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that beer is not made from hops, because from some of the remarks this morning it may be assumed that that is the case. Hops are used merely as a preservative and for flavouring in beer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also advise the Committee, if it is not already aware of it, that only the British—God bless them—make beer with the help of seeded female hops, that is, hops that have been impregnated by the male. The rest of the world, if my information is correct, uses seedless female hops. We must note, therefore, that beer is never made with the direct assistance of male hops. To some extent, the flamboyant language used by my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) has not been totally relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 5 has come about as a result of pressure from British hop growers who want to cash in on the export market. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will comment on that when he replies. I am advised that only I2 hop farms out of about 500 want to export, which means that all male hop plants in the areas in question have to be destroyed. Once this Bill becomes law, designated areas will be mapped out by Ministry experts and everyone will have to co-operate in the eradication of the virile hop, in order to prevent pollination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all a question of the alpha acid which the brewers obtain from the hops. The rest of the world, supported by many large brewers in this country, including the Brewers' Society and the Hops Marketing Board, are of the opinion that seedless hops produce more alpha acid. Because the brewers can use as much or as little of the acid as they wish, like a housewife adding flour to a cake, they can meddle with the taste of the beer. Few, if any, experts or connoisseurs of beer could possibly complain or even know that his or her beer had been made with a seeded or seedless hop. It is important to have that information before we reach a decision on this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The advantage of seedless hons is their greater bittering effect, which is a third
	<span class='label label-info column'>338</span>
higher as a result of the alpha acid content in seedless hops. However, yields per acre of seedless hops are approximately 20 per cent. lower than the seeded variety. Therefore, the economics of growing seedless hops are not necessarily advantageous. It is important to take that point into consideration while we are considering Clause 5.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>The Chairman's 	<i>attention having been called to the fact that six Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room, and six Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that we have a quorum again. Perhaps it is the attraction of what lies downstairs almost immediately beneath us, that may well have drawn those hon. Members who should be here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British hop growers have a greater capacity to produce than the British market has the potential to absorb their products. But until the world market recovers—and it is in a downturn at the moment—it is important that our growers do not over-produce. Furthermore, the exercise is of no relevance if seedless hops are not competitive, first, with the seeded hops and, secondly, with the seedless hops grown abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore it is important to establish. first, that there is a valid market for seedless hops and, secondly, that any aid given by FEOGA for replanting hop gardens is not used to grow hops whose ultimate destiny is to collect aid in a depressed market. That is particularly important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, it must be first established that subsection (3)(	<i>b</i>) adequately protects the interests of growers in a given area who wish to continue with seeded hops—a point we have debated already at some length—and, secondly, that subsection (8), concerning powers of entry, is carefully scrutinised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 22nd November last, a report appeared in the 	<i>Daily Telegraph</i> stating that the Bill
	<br><blockquote><p>"… is in response to increasing demands by British Brewers for seedless hops."</p></blockquote>
This is a misrepresentation of what the Hops Marketing Board actually said and is, therefore, to be ignored, particularly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0191">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>339</span>
as I am advised that many independent brewers in this country—especially one close to this House, Youngs—prefer to keep things as they are and are most suspicious that the price of the seedless variety of hop may rise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My purpose is to obtain clear assurances from the Government on a number of points. Will the Minister clearly emphasise that the eradication of the male hop in designated areas is not the thin end of the wedge? Will he give an assurance that traditional brewers using traditional British seeded hops will always be able to obtain them if they wish to do so? Will he further give a firm assurance that the whole exercise is not just a gigantic farce, with the taxpayer paying a fortune to eradicate male hops for the sake of a pittance in export orders?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the point I made earlier. Is there a large opportunity for exports, and is the seedless British hop likely to be competitive with the seedless hops produced overseas? Will the Minister ensure that inferior hop extracts are not imported on a grand scale into this country to replace our hops?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The points I have raised have been expressed to me by a large number of people and a large number of organisations. Are the Government aware of exactly what they are doing in putting forward this Bill and the effect that it will have? These are all serious points and require to be dealt with most seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not follow exactly what my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) has just talked about. I am well aware of his connection with the worthy aims of the Campaign for the Maintenance of Real Ale, and as I spent the first 20 years of my life living within one-quarter of a mile of perhaps the most famous of all the country's small private breweries producing real ale at present, I am not unacquainted or unsympathetic to the points he raised. But I want to raise a number of issues which have not so far been touched upon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, and earlier today, I made it clear that the Opposition's sympathies basically lie with the Government, the Hops Marketing Board and the majority of hop growers who wish to
	<span class='label label-info column'>340</span>
establish a market abroad for seedless hops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is utterly desirable. My hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) referred at our last Sitting to a remark I made on Second Reading, that to establish this regime will need a degree of ministerial muscle. Whilst he and I deplore, in our philosophic approach, the excessive use of ministerial muscle, I regret to say that in establishing a regime of this sort there is no option but to have a strengthening of ministerial muscle on these matters. Having said that we approve the general aims of the clause, I hope that the Minister will answer a number of questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provided the general aims of the Bill become law, will the Minister tell us how soon the Government propose to start issuing orders under Clause 5? Will he give us some idea of when he envisages the first orders being made? Does he intend to start with one in Kent and one in, say, Herefordshire and to enlarge those areas? Or does he intend to start with only one? It would be helpful if the Minister would tell us to what extent he envisages the hop-growing areas of this country being included within orders under the clause. If we could have some idea of Government strategy on the matter it would be of great assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to raise one detailed point regarding statutory instruments which will be laid in conjunction with these provisions. Under subsection (4) these orders will be
	<br><blockquote><p>"subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of their House of Parliament …".</p></blockquote>
That, I hope, means that that is the annulment point and does not mean that the ability to consider the statutory instrument will be limited to either House of Parliament. On a matter of this sort, it is essential that the opportunity to discuss and annul, if necessary, these orders should be within the gift of both Houses of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should next like to turn to the next stage of the establishment of the orders after the area has been designated and ask the Minister how he envisages the policing or control of the male hop plant. This is the tenth debate this morning, and in the course of one of them I asked him about common land. He replied that the growers will take the initiative. How does the Minister see the operation
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0192">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>341</span>
of the scheme within an area in the first year after the establishment of a designated area and a seedless hop zone? How does he envisage the seeking out of the male hop plants?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard evidence this morning of the safe region being three miles to prevent the pollination of a female hop plant. Therefore, a minute hop garden, to be surrounded by a safe zone of three miles, would need an area of 28 square miles. That is a large area. There will be large areas with parcels of land which will need close inspection for any male hops. Clearly, it is beyond the capacity of the Minister's officers to go round looking for male hops. As he said, the growers will take part of the initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the hon. Gentleman imagine that the growers within a designated area will get together and that they will take it upon themselves to travel round the designated area, systematically looking for male hop plants? It is important that, when areas have been established, active steps are taken to search out any male hop plants. Growers forming themselves into " search and destroy " groups also presents difficulties. As the Minister said, the principal way male hops will be destroyed is by the use of herbicides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can envisage growers and their employees looking around the countryside for male hops and, to use a North country word, "doctoring" them with herbicides. That could create problems because they might also kill other plants around the male hops. If someone should find a male hop growing in a hedgerow and treat it with a herbicide, it is possible that the surrounding plants would be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>342</span>
That brings me to the next point. Will the Minister tell us whether he would agree—and clearly it is impossible, though desirable—to eliminate all male hops in a designated area? To what extent is a sample of seedless hops permitted to contain an element of seeded ones? It will be impossible to eliminate every male plant; some female hops within the hop gardens will be seeded by mistake. If a percentage of seeded hops is allowed within a sample of seedless hops, will it be necessary to find every male hop in the area?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raised a point earlier about common land. The difficulty with common land—and I spent many hours in the House during the passing of the Commons Registration Act—arises through the intricacies of the law. Some commoners jealously guard their rights and difficulties have arisen because thousands of cases are still awaiting arbitration under the Commons Registration Act. They are causing immense delays—as the Government courteously wrote to me the other day—to the essential need to get on with the next commons legislation to improve land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But if groups of commoners resented people going over common land sprinkling herbicides, it might be necessary for the Minister to use his powers under this Bill to eliminate any male hops growing on common land. Who would be invited to pay?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
