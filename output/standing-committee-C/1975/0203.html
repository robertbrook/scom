	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this amendment we are discussing Amendment No. 67, in page 9, line 20, leave out " may " and insert " Shall".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Gavin Strang)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we adjourned last Thursday, hon. Members raised a number of points. I believe that some of them were based on a misunderstanding of the Government's position, and I hope, Mr. Costain, that you will allow me a little time to explain why I think these amendments should not be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are, of course, differing views as to whether we should export livestock for slaughter at all, but it is common ground that, if we are to exportlivestock, we have a duty to ensure, as far as is possible, that they are properly treated. We helped to formulate and strongly supported the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Animals in International Transport. We also welcomed the EEC directive on humane slaughter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need information on the proposed destinations of the exported farm animals, the arrangements for transporting them there and the treatment which they will receive on arrival. We need this in order to comply effectively with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>392</span>
present and any future obligations, and also in order to make it possible for our veterinary staff to co-operate with their opposite numbers abroad inensuring that the welfare regulations are observed in practice. I am sure that no member of this Committee would wish shipments to be permitted in circumstances where we could not be assured of the welfare of the exported animals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) referred to the possibility of animals being sent to North Africa. We do not allow the export of animals for slaughter to any countries where humane slaughter is not practised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holland with Boston is not yet with us, but I assure the Committee that there is no question of our departing from the assurances that my right hon. Friend gave in the debates in the House on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no evidence that any animals shipped from this country have been slaughtered in any non-European country for many years. The hon. Member for Holland with Boston said that he had heard suggestions that, if the clause were passed without an Order being made, the protection now afforded to exported animals would be reduced. This is not the case. Effective control overthe welfare of exported livestock is already being exercised by means of administrative arrangements under The Exported Animals Protection Order 1964,and by licensing control under The Export of Goods (Control) Order 1970 administered by the Department of Trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These arrangements are working satisfactorily, and will continue to operateuntil such time as Ministers make Orders under Clause 8. It is hoped that this clause will enable the introduction of a new control system, operated exclusively by the Agriculture Departments, which would be simpler for exporters and offer comprehensive protection to the animals concerned. The emphasis should, I think, be on a proper consultation with all concerned to get the best control system, and I would not wish these essentials to be sacrificed in order to comply with a fixed time limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the Minister's firm intention to make an Order as soon as possible. However. present licensing controls operated by the Department of Trade are on a United Kingdom basis, and we wish to continue with a uniform export policy
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0222">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>393</span>
for the United Kingdom as a whole. Hence we would prefer not to make an Order covering Great Britain until corresponding legislation is available in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that all hon. Members will agree that we cannot afford to be complacent about the welfare of exported animals. Although, as I have said, thepresent arrangements are working satisfactorily, I would not wish to miss any opportunity which might occur in the future to introduce further safeguards, or to correct any shortcomings which may become apparent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause as it stands will enable Ministers to do this. Amendment No. 62,if carried, would limit Ministers' powers for the making of Orders to a period of 12 months from the passing of the Act. I am sure hon. Members will see that this limitation could prevent Ministers from introducing new welfare controls which might be required in the future as a result of changes in the pattern of trade, or of new developments in transport, or new international agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) indicated inhis speech in the last debate in the House of Commons, when the House votedto resume the export of live animals on the basis of assurances given by myright hon. Friend, that although he voted for that he subsequently—if not regretted it—wondered whether he had taken the right decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been one incident. My learned Friend might be thinking in particular of the French incident which was featured on a BBC television programmeI saw that programme and it was very interesting. I hardly ever see television, but it so happened that I managed to get back to Scotland in time to see that programme one Thursday night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should explain that we have been able, following that incident, to introduce, on an administrative basis, a further tightening of the situation and an addition to the information which we obtain from these exporters. To some extent, this legislation will enable us to put this on a more effective statutory footing when the Order is made. We have found that the French authorities have responded to our representations
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>394</span>
and we are building up a very effective relationship between the veterinaryofficers representing the Ministry in this country and in other countries,particularly France, to where these live exports are made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing I have said detracts from my hon. Friend's observation that where at all possible we favour the export of carcases rather than live animals. There is no doubt that that is the view of the majority of British people, and of the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning now to Amendment No 67, which deals with the question of what information exporters should be required to give, we must be in a position to obtain all the relevant details, but we should like to be able to do this without asking for more information than is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause as it stands will enable Ministers to make Orders to protect thewelfare of any type of animals. In any Order designed to protect the welfare of exported food animals, it will be necessary for the exporter to declare the final destination of the animals and the arrangements for conveying them later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, this Clause may later be used to make Orders to control the exportof other species of animals in different circumstances. In some cases—for example, horses going abroad for racing or for exhibition—it might not be necessary to insist that the final destination is stated. For this reason, I would prefer that Ministers should be given discretion to decide on exactly what information is appropriate in relation to particular Orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Clause is drafted in the usual discretionary form appropriate to an enabling Act. I hope that theCommit-tee will agree to pass it as it stands, thereby giving Ministers continuing powers to make Orders to give proper protection to the welfare of exported animals.In return, I can assure the Committee that the first Order under this Clause will he made as soon as possible, bearing in mind the consideration whichI have mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, I should like to go further. I have carefully considered this matter since the last meeting of the Committee and I am happy to assure the Committee that the Government will ensure that the Order is made within 12 months—which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0223">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>395</span>
meets precisely the point which has been made by the hon. Members on both sides.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may be going to mention a point I raised on the question of declaring, which I thought was to be mandatory upon the exporters, the method of conveyance from the port to the ultimate destination.That is how I—a layman—read the paragraph, and the Minister may remember that I made the point that I thought it would be impossible to state whether the animals were to go by lorry, train, air, or whatever it would be, depending on conditions in the country concerned. I hope from whatthe Minister has said that it will not be mandatory and can be altered in each circumstance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it can be altered in each circumstance and we take the hon. Gentleman's point than an exporter might intend—I think this wouldbe exceptional—that a load of livestock once at, say, a port in France would go by train—which is unusual but that might be his intention—and if a train strike occurred he would want to send he livestock on by vehicle. We certainly take that point abroad and there is no questionof writing in impractical requirements. However, that is not to say that wdo not want information on what is intended, and we will not in any way be prepared to do without information which we think would be helpful, and necessary to ensure proper surveillance of animals, both in this country beforethey leave and, more important in the mind of many hon. Members, in the receiving country also.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister is aware of the occasions on which a veterinary officer inspects live animals that are exported, both in this country before they go and when they arrive at the other end inthe port lairage, and again when they actually arrive at the slaughterhouselairage. Inevitably, the professional position of a veterinary officer is at stake if he is to overlook or inadequately to supervise this operation. Ihope that the Minister will make it clear that he is satisfied that the veterinary officers do a proper job, and that the health and welfare of these animals are fully cared for and taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>396</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I accept that. At the same time, we need the clause because we need powers to obtain additional information. We are determined to leave no stone unturned in meeting the view of the vast majority of Members ofthe House. There can be no question about that. There was great reluctance on the part of the House of Commons to pass the Motion which finally enabled this trade to resume, and there is an important obligation on the Government to see that every effort is made to prevent hardship to animals exported to other countries and to the Community in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment also suffers from a technical disability of a legal nature. In the years to come, Orders might be made which relate to animal welfare generally and in such Orders it could be nonsensical for there to be a mandatory requirement whereby the Order would have to contain a reference to the information referred to in subsection (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remarks of all hon. Members on Amendment No. 62 indicate that there is general support for the Government's intentions to tighten up the regulations surrounding the export of live animals. I think that I shall have said enough to assure hon. Members who were pressing the amendment that the Government have taken on board the urgency which they attach to the clause and will indeed see that appropriate measures are laid before Parliament as soonas possible, and certainly within 12 months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I greatly appreciate, as I am sure the whole Committee does, what the Parliamentary Secretary has just said, particularly the undertaking he has given about making the necessary Orders within 12 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I, however, ask him a little more about Amendment No. 67? He cast some doubt on whether such an amendment would be necessary, suggesting that it might even be anachronistic—I think that was the word he used. Real concern has been expressed about this trade by farmers as much as anyone else. Many farmers regard it as a stigma upon what they are doing. and they dislike as much as anyone the kind of publicity this trade is attracting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two matters which are sought in subsection (2) are absolutely essential. One is the information relating to the intended destination of these animals.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0224">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>397</span>
There is much less concern about animals going to Rotterdam or just across the Channel, but when they are re-exported many miles beyond that, perhaps to North Africa and elsewhere, there is a matter for real concern. The second is the arrangements for conveying them. This goes to the heart of any cruelty that may exist. One would have thought that no information could be as important as those two matters which Amendment No. 67 requires to be put into any notice by the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caerwyn Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I bring to the attention of my hon. Friend something which has been put to me recently on another aspect of this matter—the export of foals and ponies for slaughter. This trade seems to take place largely from mid-Wales and Scotland to Northern Ireland, and subsequently to Eire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Great disquiet has been expressed about the transport of these animals. Often they are far too young for this purpose. They are taken along with the parent, even though they may be under age for such long journeys. Disquiet has been expressed about lairage. It seems that there is not adequate cover to ensure their proper welfare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind my hon. Friend of a letter written last December by his Department to one of my constituents. It says:
	<br><q><p>"One general point that I might perhaps make is that the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Animals in International Transport, which came into effect between most member countries of the EEC on 1 July 1974 has in fact since been ratified by both Italy and Ireland. The Convention does not cover trade between Scotland and Northern Ireland as this does not fall within the definition of international transport. I would therefore doubt whether the Convention is particularly relevant to the trade in Shetland ponies which you mention."</p></q>
of course, am concerned about Welsh ponies from mid-Wales which have to do the journer to Stranraer in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter goes on:
	<br><q><p>"The other point is that large numbers of horses and ponies make long road and sea journeys within the British Isles and in general it has been found that the welfare legislation in the UK and in the Republic of Ireland has ensured that these animals travel without unnecessary suffering."</p></q>
I maintain that people are not convinced that these animals are adequately covered. I hope that my hon. Friend will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>398</span>
take another look at this provision to see whether more can be done. Many of us will subsequently have to resist this trade entirely unless we can getmore protection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The export of live animals came to a sudden stop somewhat by accident under the previous Conservative Government. I believe that there was some upset in the passage of another Bill. However, the succeedingAdministration attempted to put matters right, having the O'Brien Report intheir possession. I studied that Report most carefully, and had consultations with various bodies in my constituency—both the animal lobby, if I may so describe it, and the farming lobby.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took the view that the findings of the O'Brien Committee were taken by a responsible body and were well considered. On the assurances that the Minister gave at the Dispatch Box, I acquiesced in the proposals, only to be horrified, distraught and overwhelmed with mail in the succeeding weeks as a result of the poor application of the undertakings which the Minister gave. Admittedly, I rapidly received letters from the Minister or his deputies interms of prosecutions which had ensued, I believe, in France at the time
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to take full consciousness of the position of Members ofthe House of Commons. He will be as aware as anyone that concern for animals,whether in terms of vivisection or whatever, is far greater than concernforchildren—alas, and curiously. Possibly, it comes second to concern about changes in the canon law, certainly in my part of the country. I am not being facetious. It is a problem which concerns many people very deeply and causes much vexation. as well as emotion, to Members on both sides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I re-emphasise my own distress that the provisions and undertakings of the O'Brien Report appeared to be bottomless to some degree when it came to theacid test. Therefore, I urge upon the Minister the obligatory words of the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) in his remarks about the, as always, gracious reply and—on this occasion, rather more unusually—helpful reply from the Parliamentary Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>399</span>
I follow the argument about 12 months and I welcome my lion. Friend's assurance in relation to it, but does this not prove or, at least, bear out our point rather than remove it on the need for the word "shall". There is no harm in using "shall". There may be an argument about 12 months and that difficulties will arise, but now that the case has been admitted that the Government's intention is to do this as a safeguard, the consciousness that they are taking this on board surely can only be underlined by using "shall".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go into the whole logic of this matter. I did that like a university class in logic last week and I do not intend to repeat it today.However, the Parliamentary Secretary's speech rather emphasises that, and Iwonder whether he will consider an amendment, perhaps in another place, to introduce "shall" instead of "may". As this is clearly the Government's intention in any case, nothing can be lost thereby.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will have another look at AmendmentNo. 67. I should have thought that the one argument against "shall" in subsection (2) would be that it would provide a more onerous duty on behalf of those handling the matter and the question of ultimate destination leading to difficulty. Nobody can fill in a form other than to the best of his ability. If those who fill in a form give the destination as they understand itto be, I should have thought that would be sufficient for any legal requirement. There may be confusion because the intended ultimate destination may not be the ultimate destination in actual practice. There seems little reason why the Order should not contain this, and why the necessary form shouldnot be completed in this way other than it is another difficulty for the people filling in the form. It is a duty that we should undertake. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will look at those two matters as sympathetically as he looked at the issues last week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A third point, however, has been brought to my attention by an Opposition Member. We saw evidence of this last night on television in a rather horrifying film about cock-fighting. I am not sure whether those animals come within the remit of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food when they are fighting or only when they are procreating.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>400</span>
In either event, I hope that he will draw it to the attention of the appropriate authorities which deal with these matters in order that that, too, may be banned as we are trying to do with hare coursing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his reply. I hope that he will carry out his intentions even further and write this matter into the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very briefly, I will reply, first, to the point made by the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body). We certainly need to know the destination of these animals, and it is the case that in practice most exporters know what is intended. We expect them to find out if they do not know. That is the purpose of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) raised the question of ponies. I assure my hon. Friend that I will take it upon myself to look into the question more fully. The O'Brien Committee considered the question of shipments to Northern Ireland, as my hon. Friend knows, and forhealth reasons decided that trade to Northern Ireland is limited to a very small number of high value breeding animals. It argued that there was no question of these animals being ill-treated or re-exported. Notwithstanding these points taken from O'Brien I will, as I say, look at this question again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentions the transport of high quality animalsfor breeding. I was speaking of animals going for slaughter. It is known that they are going for slaughter. They are ponies used for pet foods, and soon, which eventually go to Southern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is why I have undertaken to have a further look at this matter. I am sure my hon. Friend recognises that nothing he has said would lead us not to want to press ahead with the clause. What he is doing is usingthe debate, quite rightly, as an opportunity to raise this matter, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew-shire, West (Mr. Buchan). He raised the question of cock-fighting. That is something that is not strictly pertinent to the clause, never mind the amendment. However, once again, I am happyto assure my hon. Friends that I will look into that point also.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0226">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>401</span>
Any evidence held by my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor on exports would be helpful and my officials will look into it as a matter of urgency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was disingenuous of the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) to say that there was an "accidental" vote in the House of Commons during the period of the Conservative Administration which had the effect of stopping the trade in live animals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A mistake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that it was either accidental or a mistake, to take up the word interjected by the Member for Macclesfield.

It was a reflection of strongly held views by a large number of hon. Members which, in turn, reflected feeling in the country. All hon. Members receieletters continually—although the Scots are less prone to this thanthe English—and throughout the United Kingdom there is an intensely active animal welfare lobby. The vote in the House of Commons during the Conservative Administration reflected that, as indeed did the debate in whichmyright hon. Friend gave certain assurances with regard to this trade. He also adequately took into account the views of those who are most concerned about the welfare of live animals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge was being a little unfair when he suggested that the Ministry was not implementing adequately, or sufficiently urgently, the assurances given by my right hon. Friend. I think he would acknowledge that he was once again referring particularly to that highly publicised French incident. We welcomed the fact that the BBC had come across that incident and drew it to our attention, since when we have acted swiftly. But the hon. Gentleman knows better than I that we are not responsible for what happens on French soil. We can only seek to influence the veterinary profession and the authorities in other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most people who follow these matters closely would support the assertion I have already made, that we are now achieving a good relationship with the French veterinary profession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I must take up one point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West. He may not have heard the point I made earlier about Amendment No. 62, which was that we want to introduce an Order so as to be able to require additional information and tighten up the position, but in 14 months or two years' time we might want to introduce another Order. Under Amendment No. 62 we should not be able to so do. We should require to introduce it within 12 months and then the power is lapsed. Surely hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point I was really making was not that my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to return to the argument of why enabling legislation invariably uses "may" rather than "shall". But there can be no argument between us in that the Government have given an assurance that they will lay this Order within 12 months. We shall consider the point that the hon. Member has made and refer to it again on Report, but at this stage I cannotgive an undertaking that we shall change the clause. We shall take into account the points which he and other hon.

which generates even more vexation—that was the word used by my hon.Friend—and concern among people in the country and hon. Members thanthe export of cattle for slaughter on the Continent or elsewhere.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 61, in page 9, line 18, at end insert:
	<br><q><p>"The Minister and Secretary of State shall consult with any representative body of exporters before making any new regulations affecting the circumstances in which and conditions on which a certificate or licence may be obtained".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><q><p>"(5) No order shall be made under this Act until the Minister has consulted the main organisations that are representative of the exporters of farm animals".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is self-evident. The amendment arose mainly through the difficulty that exporters of carcase meat—whose case I took up earlier in the proceedings and who are constituents of myhon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body)—were having in not getting sufficient consultations on a proper footing to enable them to carry on their business. I want to make quite sure that representative bodies of exporters—including the British Livestock Export Councilunder the chairmanship of a former Secretary of State for Scotland, I believe, whose new title in the House of Lords I cannot pronounce—are fully consulted sufficiently
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>404</span>
far ahead for these consultations to be practical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has already given his undertaking that the consultations wouldhave to be in a practical form. He understands that, and all I ask is for him to undertake these consultations. If he can give me that assurance, I shall be perfectly happy. I hope that this consultation is really meaningful—as the phraseology has it these days—and that bodies that export cattle have sufficient time to consult their constituent members so that they have practical knowledge to discuss with the Minister's representatives and bring forth practical regulations which will meet the Minister's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment that I tabled—No. 70—is in substantially the same terms, but my purpose is that, although I am in favour of my own constituents being consulted, particularly any constituent with the largest possible interest in this trade, there are many others who are concerned with the export of cattle and other livestock who should have their viewstaken into account. I have in mind the National Farmers' Union and the various pedigree organisations that are active in the export trade of animals for breeding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should declare an interest, which I failed to do earlier, because I have over the years exported many animals, although I am glad to say they were to for immediate slaughter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want a number of regulations imposed upon us that are intended toprevent cruelty being avoided if we also imperil some of our exports to countries much further away than the Continent where we have, in recent years,built up a considerable export trade, as the Minister well knows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore hope that, even if the amendment does not need to be added to the Bill, the Minister will indicate the kind of consultation he has in mindand will, perhaps, give an undertaking that he will consult not just those who are immediately concerned with exporting but also farmers, livestock breeders, and others, who have a considerable interest in ensuring that this trade is cleaned up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to assure hon. Members that it is our practice, and we shall certainly look at this assiduously, to consult all the interests concerned before making new Orders on animal

welfare under the Diseases of Animals Act 1950.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A very wide range of interests are involved, including particularly the farmers' unions and the numerous animal welfare societies and, of course, the organisations concerned with the export of animals. This procedure is so well established and understood that I would not think it necessary for the present clause to specify that consultation must be held, and certainly I would regard it as most undesirable to suggest that one set of interests should be given a legal right to consultations but not others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, although I cannot accept these amendments, I can assure hon. Members that Ministers will in practice act in accordance with the spirit of the amendments. Hon. Members have indicated that these are probing amendments and that they want an assurance that we will consult properly and meaningfully with these interested organisations. I am happy to give such assurances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With such good will now prevailing throughout the Committee, and with so many liberal assurances coming from the Government, I feel these two amendments might be withdrawn altogether in the hope that, when we reach the next amendment, the good will can continue. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw these amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They have not been moved, so they cannot be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 65, in page 9, line 27, leave out subsection (3) and insert:
	<br><q><p>"(3) It shall be an offence punishable by a fine of £500 on summary conviction for a person required to furnish the information under subsection (2) to provide information that is false."</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>406</span>
This amendment is intended to give some teeth to the regulations. I may be mistaken, but it appears that there is no penalty to be exacted if somebodywho is exporting these animals is doing so badly, contrary to regulations, and choosing to disobey the regulations and give false information. I hope that the Minister will assure me that that is not the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that in introducing the regulations the Minister will be able to say that the regulations themselves contain a penalty clause. If that is not the case, it is self-evident we should have some penalty so that those who give false information—as has been done in the past when application has been made for export licences—should be punished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said earlier this morning that he saw the film showing the export of sheep from this country. They went on to Paris, down to Marseilles, and possibly beyond to North Africa. As I understand it, the man who applied for the export licence inserted false information in his application form. He has not since been punished, because it seems that the Minister has nopower to institute proceedings against him. If that be true or otherwise, perhaps the Minister would be good enough to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From that film, plus other evidence that has been available to many of us who are concerned with farming and who move around the markets, we know perfectly well that some very grubby activities have been going on among these exporters who are making money out of British farmers and British consumers. They are people for whom we need have no sympathy. They are doing no service to British agriculture in the way some of them have behaved. Of course,I exempt the larger and reputable companies, but there are many smaller exporters who have behaved contemptibly and, it is understood, dishonestly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is self-evident that exporters who give wrong or misleading information in an application form should be prosecuted. Otherwise, these regulations will not be enforced. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will either give us a clear assurance that people who give false information can be prosecuted as the law now is or will be under the Bill, or alternatively that he will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>407</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to support my hon. Friend the Memberfor Holland with Boston (Mr. Body). Although I have not found myself in sympathy with one or two of the probing amendments which he has moved so far, I am a believer in incentives and disincentives. I believe that this disincentive—a sharp penalty for providing misinformation—would reassure not only members of this Committee but the public at large that thoseengaged in the trade are 	<i>bona fide,</i> and that false information is notbeing given, and that the destination stated on documents is the destination to which the animals are going for slaughter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While saying this, I must dissociate myself from some of my hon. Friend's remarks. I believe that, as a whole, the trade—the farmers, the auctioneers, the exporters, and all those involved in the export of live animals, particularly cattle, for slaughter on the Continent, care as much about the animals as the layman, Members of this House, and those urban dwellers who are deeply concerned about the welfare and health of animals exported for slaughter to the Continent. It is only in an isolated case that there is abuse—perhaps one in 100, or even fewer than that. There are not allthat many people involved in this trade who abuse the situation, who createunsatisfactory conditions, and who are not concerned about the health of the animals under their care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Notwithstanding the remarks which I have just made, I believe that my hon. Friend has raised an interesting point in the amendment and that the Minister should have the right to impose a firm penalty to deter those who might bring the export trade into disrepute. I therefore wish to support the amendment and hope that the Minister, if he is not prepared to accept it, will indicate to the Committee how he thinks the Government should act when it comes to light that people are purposely providing false information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unless the Minister has some good reason, I support this suggestion of a fine, though I want to hear what the Minister thinks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body), with whom I have normally
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>408</span>
agreed in this Committee, on what he said about the ordinary dealer in the cattle market, though perhaps he did not intend that. The ordinary dealer in the market is one of the most valuable people in the countryside because he knows his job from A to Z, and when there is a slump in any trade he is ready to back his judgment and buy in the market when there is no other trade. Dealers perform a valuable job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I agree with what my hon. Friend said about anyone who fills in documents falsely—that, of course, does not apply here—I felt that some of my hon. Friend's remarks might be interpreted as a slur upon people who, in my opinion, have done a tremendous job over the years in enabling cattle, sheep and pigs to move and keeping trade going for different classes of animals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I conveyed that impression. I should be the last person to contradict the experiences of my hon. Friend as regards markets. Obviously the ordinary dealers have played a notable part in restoring the prosperity of British agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is that there is a minority—a disreputable minority—who are doing no good to British agriculture as a whole, to the farmer, or to the markets and those who earn their living in the markets. There are not many of them—some of them have been identified already—but they go from market to market and cause much ill-feeling among those who want the markets of this country to be well established places where a 	<i>bona fide</i> trade can be carried on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An offence under an Order made by virtue of Clause 8 would be an offence under the Diseases of Animals Act 1950, and, as such, would be punishable by the penalties laid down in Section 79 of that Act. These penalties may include fines of up to £400, or £50 ner animal if more than 10 animals are involved. The giving of false information in order to obtain a licence is an offence which may be punishable by imprisonment inlieu of a fine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A fixed penalty would be inappropriate, and since most export consignments involve more than 10 animals, the courts already have all the powers that this amendment seeks to give them. I should prefer not to complicate the 1950 Act further by providing different penalties
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0230">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>409</span>
for offences under the new section of the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will recognise the force of that argument, in addition to the fact that we can impose a fine of £50 per animal. It makes sense when we are lifting these fines, and with inflation, it might become necessary more frequently. I do not say that it will become more frequent. Given the Government's anti-inflation policy, the signs are that this will be a temporary, though severe, ripple in the average inflation rate in Britain overthe past two or three decades.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would have the effect of deleting subsection (3) of Clause 8 completely. This subsection must be retained so as to ensure that Orders made by the Minister and the Secretary of State jointly under the new sectionare to be treated as if they were Orders of the Minister under the 1950 Act. That is a technical but important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have said more than enough to reassure hon. Members that whatthey seek will be achieved without the need to press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make some new points which raise a question of profound principle. I should like to direct the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum which precedes this document and in which there are two references affecting Clause 8,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is in paragraph 5 on page 	<i>iv</i> under the heading "Financial Effects of the Bill" which says:
	<br><q><p>"The exercise of the powers under Clause 8"—</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Financial Memorandum is not part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That I appreciate, Mr. Costain, but surely it is published concurrent with it and for the guidance of hon. Members in their deliberations of the said document. I would submit humbly, but forcefully, that, it being
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>410</span>
there, it would be the utmost folly for one to ignore or cast the information on one side, or not to have right to refer to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, when it is necessary within points of order torelate to this clause in particular, as we are discussing "Clause stand part".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, but my reference expressly indicated where to find the reference, which reads:
	<br><q><p>"The exercise of the powers under Clause 8 for regulating the exportation of animals from Great Britain is not expected to result in any appreciable change in administrative or other costs."</p></q>
I should like to know more about " any appreciable change ", be it up or down, precisely what is the terminology. It strikes me as a very loosely-formed phrase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On page 	<i>v</i> of the Explanatory Memorandum, paragraph 12 reads:
	<br><q><p>"Clause 8 will not involve any significant additional staff time in the Agricultural Departments, but could lead to marginal savings of staff time at the Department of Trade."</p></q>
Here again, the wording is loose. Why should any staff time be involved at all in terms of additional members?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to relate the situation—I trust I am in order—to the generality of the growth of bureaucracy about which we are all reading so much nowadays. One of the purposes of Financial Explanatory Memoranda,as extended by the present Prime Minister under his previous administration, was to include details of Civil Service figures. That was expressly undertaken by the present Prime Minister during the 1960s, to enlighten and to inform the House on measures that it was passing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Currently Parliament finds itself the butt of many commentators for passinglegislation which on occasions is meritorious—it commends itself to the majority of the House, and frequently it commends itself to the whole House. But we are accused of not doing the reckoning, not doing the final sums. Hence my pressing as a matter of some principle, although we are not talking about very much, the need for more specific detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point I should like to raise is included in paragraph 12 on page 	<i>v</i> which says:
	<br><q><p>"Clause 8 will not involve any significant
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0231">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>411</span>
additional staff time in the Agricultural Departments, but could lead to marginal savings of staff time at the Department of Trade."</p></q>
I had personal correspondence with the Prime Minister round about May of June of last year which culminated in a Parliamentary Question, agreed previously with the Prime Minister, to which he responded saying that he would see that steps were taken that in future Explanatory Memoranda the impact of any measure being legislated by the House on local authority manpower and local authority rating would be spelled out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have only a marginal case here, but it is sufficient of a hook on which to hang my hat. I would aver that there are certain market authorities and market owners in the local authority sector who could well be affected by the operation of Clause 8. If they are, it should be so stated. If they are not, it should be so stated, if the Prime Minister's undertakings mean anything and if the Howe intends, as it has purported to do in recent weeks—I would not say "months" but "weeks" quite expressly—to exert a closer scrutiny and hold over the public purse. We must restrainourselves in terms of measures which we impose upon the country unless and until we carefully calculate the cross-benefit and the taxation consequences of such measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have not transgressed too far, Mr. Costain. I felt it was quite appropriate for you to make the point that you did. I am not endeavouring to ingratiate myself in any way. You kept me on the lines, but equally itis a matter of principle that one should be allowed, when debating " Clausestand part ", to make cross reference to something that appears stapled together with the same document. It would be entirely ludicrous were we to do an Admiral Nelson on this and pretend that it did not exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member. A cross-reference is perfectly in order. When it becomes a major topic of debate it is out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse the comments of my hon. Friend the Memberfor Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) and expressing the hope that the Minister will give us a full and detailed reply, bearing in mind the position of the Prime Minister in these
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>412</span>
matters. I rise to apologise for raising a matter earlier in the debate when it should have been raised now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two points to raise. I start with that on which you corrected me, Mr. Costain—that is the matter of the export of horses. The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) raised this earlier in the debate and I did not think that the Parliamentary Secretary gave an adequate reply. This is a matter which causes grave concern, grave vexation, grave worry, not only to Members of the House but to many people outside the House whose interests and concern are our interests and concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What representations, if any, have the Ministry and the Parliamentary Secretary received from the International League for the Protection of Horses one of whose objectives is
	<br><q><p>"to combat and ameliorate country to country traffic in live horses for butchery"?</p></q>
This is a matter that generates considerable emotion. We are not a people who have much liking for horsemeat, but this is not the case on the Continent where Belgium, France and other places are big consumers of horsemeat. I know that trade in horses between this country and the Republic and betweenthe Republic and the Continent causes a great deal of anger, frustration and concern. wonder what steps the Ministry is taking to bring this traffic to an end and what safeguards exist for people who are concerned about this trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point that I want to mention is that at the beginning of the debate on this clause I said that I am basically fully in favour of the Government's position and believe that the clause, as it stands, is right and correct. But I do not think that the debate should be brought to an end without somebody saying that, although the House of Commons has a perfect right to make a decision on virtually any matter—as it did in 1973 to bringthe export of live animals to a halt for a period—I feel that as I represent a rural constituency in which livestock farming is particularly important, it is right for me to mention that the interruption of this trade brought considerable hardship to livestock farmers. I must emphasise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That interruption of the trade came at a time when the industry was facing grave problems. Farmers were suffering from liquidity difficulties and, as the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0232">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>413</span>
Minister of Agriculture, whom I am delighted to see here this morning, knows, the animals that were exported to the Continent were those that in the main were not required by the wholesalers and the slaughterers in this country, because the British housewife is a discriminating person, and barren cows and overfat bullocks did not provide the sort of meat that the people ofthis country wanted to buy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, such animals were required on the Continent, for one reason or another. At that time the continental buyers wanted them on the hoof rather than on the hook. The interruption of the export of live animals caused a considerable drop in income for many United Kingdom livestock farmers. I was naturally delighted when, under the present Government, in 1974 this trade was introduced again. I spoke forcibly in the debate, urging the Government to allow this trade to be started again, with satisfactory safeguards for animal health and welfare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can only repeat that, having given oral and written evidence to the O'Brien Committee, I believe that its recommendations clearly showed that the trade as a whole was exonerated. As my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) has said, it is only one or two niggers in the woodpile who brought a bad reputation—[An hon. Member: "That is racism".] I apologise if that is a racialist comment. We had a ruling downstairs on the use of "racialist swine", but I have not gone that far this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not be niggardly either. I thank the Minister of State for that comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interruption caused the livestock farmers of this country a great deal of trouble. Before the O'Brien recommendations were accepted by the Government, there were already fairly adequate safeguards for animal health and welfare, and the Government action on the O'Brien recommendations increased the

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to add only one point on the question of the export of horses and ponies. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr Winterton), who is managing to hunt with the hare and the hounds extremely successfully this morning. I agree with both points of view, so I suppose I am doing the same thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would add a few words about the welfare of ponies in this country, beforeexport takes place. A great number of ponies are bred and kept in back gardens in urban areas. They are treated as pet dogs, not fed with the right type of food and not given the right environment—in other words, sufficient grass to move around on. They get diseased; worms, and so on build up, and this is why many of these animals go for slaughter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish the animal welfare societies would look into this problem. I believethat overbreeding of ponies has led to the export trade, and I would like to see it stopped by far less buying by people who do not realise that ponies need special care and proper exercise. I believe the trade has become bigbecause of the demand by practically every child, urban or rural, to have apony because the neighbour has a pony. This is a question that the animal welfare societies could well look into.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon Members have raised a number of interesting points in this debate. There can be no disagreement about the need to ensure that we employ only the number of civil servants we need and, furthermore, that they work efficiently on behalf of the nation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad that the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) reminded the Committee that it was the Prime Minister himself, during the period of office of the previous Labour Government, who took the necessary steps to see that the Explanatory Memoranda of Bills passing through this House contained information on these important matters. The hon. Member has explained how he has succeeded in obtaining a further undertaking about information as to the effect that legislation might have on local authority staff and expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the main reasons why we are

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>415</span>
convinced that the clause will have no significant effect on our staff numbers is that, at present, the administration of these export controls is shared between the Department of Trade and the Agricultural Departments. We hope to simplify these arrangements by making agricultural Ministers solely responsible for these licences. I think that hon. Members would regard this as a desirable step, first because the Ministry is better placed than the Department of Trade to handle these matters and, secondly, because it makes sense where possible that responsibility should rest with one Department rather than two. It should, therefore, reduce some of the time which is spentin consultation between the two Departments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would much prefer to hear that it was the hope and intention to secure positive staff economies as a result of this Measure. I cannot see why that should not be possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Member is pushing us a little far. He must understand that the purpose of the clause is to intensify our surveillance of this trade, and we shall be asking for additional information. I think, therefore, that one could argue that one will balance out the other. We are asking here for an increase in the productivity of civil servants, and I would have thought it sensible to assume that the effect of the clause on CivilService numbers would be zero.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman, however loosely, undertake that in,say, six months' time I might be permitted to visit the Ministry and examine the paper work that ensues from the changeover?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be very happy to invite the hon Member to come to the Ministry. It would have to be about six months after the passage of the legislation. [An hon. Member: " Say ' may ' and not ' shall'."] Our officials do this work very diligently and take a great pride in it and I am sure thatthey will be happy to receive a visit from the hon. Member, because it is always encouraging to know that Members of Parliament and the public generally appreciate, and take an interest in, this work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arrangements for the inspection and certification of animals prior to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>416</span>
export will not involve more veterinary manpower than is now employed, but the veterinary inspectors will have more background information with which to carry out these duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member also referred to the question of local authority markets. Iam happy to look at this, but clearly it is the exporter who makes the application for the licence, and therefore it is the exporter who will be askedfor the additional information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The export of horses for slaughter, of course, is not allowed. That is why I asked my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick)—I repeat the request to all hon. Members—to bring to our attention any evidence they have that horses are being exported for the purpose of slaughter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is aware thatthere is a fairly long land border between Ulster and the Republic of Ireland, and that inevitably there is a free trade in horses between here and not only Ulster but also the Free State. We cannot control the export of horses from Eire to the Continent. That is the area in which there is deep concern amongst the people of Britain and Members of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but it should still be possible for hon. Members to obtainevidence. We know of the various ways employed by Members of Parliament andby distinguished members of the Press to obtain information on these matters. If this is happening, it should be possible for hon. Members to provideus with evidence of this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the remarks made by the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) regarding the interruption of trade. He has slightly overstated the position. The Government were pleased that the House was prepared to accept assurances from my right hon. Friend and a Labour Administration which it was unable to accept from the previous Conservative Minister of Agriculture. My right hon. Friend has by his subsequent actions fully justified the confidence which the House placed in him on those occasions. It is overstating the position to argue that the interruption of trade had such a disastrous effect on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0234">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>417</span>
livestock producers. It certainly had an influence, but the hon. Member would be the first to accept that there were many other factors which accounted for that difficult period through which livestock producers went and which, happily, has ended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind hon. Members that the clause concerns the exportation of animals and it enables us to introduce controls protecting the welfare of animals, not only before export but during the journey to, and on arrival at, their ultimate destination. That is a desirable objective and one which is supported by members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman started to refer to me when my hon. Friend on the Front Bench intervened. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman omitted a paragraph in what he intended to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was a great deal of truth in the hon. Gentleman's remarks. I am not sure that every young boy has a pony nowadays. I remember that it was always a mark of affluence, if not great wealth, in the area from which I came if a farm could actually afford to have a pony solely for the pleasure of the younger members of the family. That is something I was never able to obtain. I had an uncle who repeatedly promised us a pony, but it never actually arrived. I should have thought that it was the case—I amnot well versed in these matters—that rising living standards mean that more and more children living on farms have ponies. I think few children in towns have ponies—only the very privileged. I can assure the hon. Member that very few of my constituents have ponies around Edinburgh. Nevertheless, I accept that what he referred to has taken place and is undoubtedly a fact in the situation. Therefore, I agree with some of the remarks made by the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the views expressed by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee this morning, that we are all here to improve thewelfare of animal marketing in Britain. That is our duty. As a farmer, I declare my interest that it is my intention to help others to export animals and to help them look after them to the best of their ability.

We have been exporting to the Continent for many months. Does the Parliamentary Secretary envisage an increase in the livestock trade to European countries during the next few years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult for me to foresee what will happen during the next few years. One has only to look at the sheep market—I know that the hon. Member is familiar with these matters—to realise that it isimpossible to predict what will be the access for some livestock. However, implicit in our membership of the Community is an ongoing trade between Member States and this will have some influence on the trade, but I could not make any precise prediction whatsoever with regard to the actual numbers olivestock which will move across the Channel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>The following new Clause stood upon the Order Paper</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>New Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>AGRICULTURAL HOLDINGS (DECEASED TENANTS)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"(1) When the tenant of an agricultural holding has died and a notice to quit has been served by the landlord under the provisions of section 24(2)(	<i>g</i>) of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948, any one of the persons listed in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) of subsection (4) below (hereinafter called the applicant') may serve a counter-notice in writing in the prescribed form upon the landlord not more than one month after the date of service of the landlord's notice to quit, requiring that the provisions of this section shall apply.
	<ol>
	<li>Unless the landlord shall, upon receipt of the counter-notice, signify in writing his agreement thereto, the applicant may, within a period of twomonths after the date of service of the counter-notice, give notice in writing to the Agricultural Land Tribunal (hereinafter called the Tribunal ') in the prescribed form, requiring the Tribunal to decide upon the question of granting to the applicant a fresh tenancy of the holding.</li>
	<li>The Tribunal shall be empowered to grant to the applicant a fresh tenancy of the holding at a rent considered to be fair and reasonable (which rent shall be determined by the Tribunal in accordance with section 8 of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948) but otherwise with the benefit of and subject to, the terms and conditions which subsisted in the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>419</span>
deceased tenant's tenancy, and such fresh tenancy granted by the Tribunal shall commence upon the day following that in which the notice to quit is stated to expire.</li>
	<li>The Tribunal shall not make an order for the grant of a fresh tenancy as aforesaid unless it is satisfied as to each of the following that is to say—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>that the applicant is either the surviving spouse, or a son, daughter, grandson, grand-daughter of the deceased tenant, or is a person to whom the deceased tenant at the date of his death was in loco parentis; and</li>
	<li>that the applicant, has, for a period of three years or upwards, immediately preceding the death of the tenant, lived upon the holding, and has been actively engaged, with the tenant, or under his direction, in the farming of that holding;
or that the applicant, is by reason of age, and is in all other respects a fit and proper person to hold a tenancy of that holding; and</li>
	<li>that greater hardship would be caused to the applicant by reason of the Tribunal refusing to grant a fresh tenancy than would be suffered by the landlord in the event of such a fresh tenancy being granted; and</li>
	<li>that it would be fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case for a fresh tenancy of the holding to be granted to the applicant.</li></ol>
	<li>The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food shall be empowered to make regulations prescribing the respective forms of counter-notice, and notice of reference to the Tribunal hereinbefore referred to. Such regulationsshall be made by statutory instrument which shall be subject to annulment by the House of Commons.</li>
	<li>Save as aforesaid the provisions of section 24 of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948 shall remain in and be of full force and effect."</li></ol></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Fred Peart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move:
	<br><q><p>That consideration of Clause 9 be postponed until after consideration of new Clause 1.</p></q>
With your permission, Mr. Costain, and in explanation of my decision to move this procedural motion, it might be of general convenience to the Committee if I were to say a brief word on the Government's intentions regarding the inclusion in the Bill of provision for family succession to agriculturaltenancies in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been giving careful consideration to the views expressed on Second Reading and to the many representations that my right hon. Friend and have received on this subject. I could
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>420</span>
not fail to be impressed by the strength of feeling in the House about the present disparity and practice between Scotland, on the one hand, and England and Wales, on the other. It is a feeling not confined to the Government back benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further consideration, which it would have been wrong for me to ignore, was the case put forward by the National Farmers' Union, in which it called for a limited scheme of family succession with appropriate safeguards to avoid hardship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have decided that it would be right to introduce in the Billa scheme providing for family succession to tenancies. I should like briefly to describe its main features
The scheme will have many points of similarity to the Scottish legislation and to the new Clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Durham (Mr. Hughes) and others. It will enable a close relative of a deceased tenant whohas the requisite agricultural experience, health and financial standing torun the farm efficiently, and who has worked on the farm for a significant period of years, to apply to the Agricultural Land Tribunal for consent to succeed to the tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A direct bequest of a tenancy will give the beneficiary priority over any other applicant but only provided that he or she has all the qualifications I have mentioned. At the same time, the current statutory grounds under which a landlord can seek to regain possession of tenanted land will be retained and strengthened in the interests of improved farm structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am considering the representations that have been made to me by the Association of County Councils and others about the special position of statutory smallholdings. These holdings are under the direct control of elected local authorities or myself and are a traditional gateway into farming for theyoung entrant. I am not at present convinced of the need for the scheme to apply to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that this decision may cause some concern to landlords in Englandand Wales, but I believe that much of this will be dispelled when details of the proposed scheme are available. It will contain effective safeguards for landlords, and I am willing to consider any
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0236">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>421</span>
detailed recommendations that their representatives may wish to put to me. Apart from the reference to the Agricultural Land Tribunal, the scheme willclosely follow what I am informed is already common practice among the moreenlightened landlords who give a son or daughter preference in selecting a tenant to succeed a deceased father. I am confident, therefore, that the provision will hold a fair balance between the interests of the various parties involved and strengthen still further the landlord-tenant system of farming which plays so important a role in British agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the complications of the new provisions I was doubtful whether it would be possible for me to table the Government amendment in time for it to be considered by this Committee, and I had intended, therefore, to introduceit on Report. Representations have, however, been made to me on this point and I will do all I can to speed matters up so that I can put down the amendment during the Committee stage. I recognise the reasons which led its sponsors to table new Clause 1. But it will come as no surprise to them to learn that on so complicated an issue it would be more satisfactory for the Government to table their own clauses, and I hope that my hon. Friends and the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw their clause and give their supportto those which the Government will table in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I point out that this is basically a procedure motion to give the Minister an opportunity to make a statement. It will not be in order to adduce an argument on new Clause 1. We are discussing the procedure motion on individual clauses. It will be in order to refer to the comments made by the Minister about his new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful for the Minister's courtesy in consulting us through the usual channels and giving us warning of what he intendedto propose this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Government have been wise to advise hon. Gentlemen on their own back benches to withdraw new Clause 1. It was becoming increasinglyclear that their clause was unacceptable to everybody. We have heard that its drafting was faulty, and that alone was
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>422</span>
enough reason for urging that it should have been taken away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition would have unhesitatingly voted against new Clause 1. I havea letter signed by the President of the National Farmers' Union from which I quote one sentence:
	<br><q><p>"We shall also make our views clear again beyond doubt, and will oppose theamendment put down by Government back-bench MPs which goes much too far."</p></q>
This was a widely held point of view and the Government have been wise to advise the rejection of new Clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give us the date of the letter and readsome of the other sentences in the letter so that we have the total view expressed and not a qualified view?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quoting from a letter which Sir Henry Plumb wrote on 19thDecember 1975 to a Mr. Bunbury, who lives near Woodbridge in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton). It is a long letter and I would be out of order to read it in its entirety,but it is a letter which a great many people have seen, and I should be surprised if the Minister himself has not been able to see it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister announced this morning that the Government intend to bring in a clause of their own on this matter. This constitutes a considerable U-turn on the part of the Government and of the Minister in particular. We remember what the Under-Secretary said on Second Reading—this is in column 1351 of the OFFICIAL REPORT—where he implied quite clearly that this matter was not to be considered in what was to be a relatively uncontroversial Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. He more or less told usthat there was not sufficient time for the Government to include this matter, and that if it had originally been included in the Bill the LegislationCommittee would have thrown it out. That constitutes a U-turn on the one side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember a number of legislation Standing Committees in the 1960s. The Minister will also remember them quite well. I recall that he opposed and hadrejected a similar proposal to this which was at that time put forward by his own back benches. He argued then that the proposal was not a good thing to do. This, therefore, constitutes a U-turn on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0237">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>423</span>
the part of the Minister himself. I do not necessarily criticise him for that. A great many of us at some time in our lives change our minds. That is something which is open to all of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Minister's remarks this morning reassure us to a certain extent in that he believes that this new clause, which has been tabled by his own back benchers, is wrong. I hope that he recognises that the effect of thenew clause would be considerably to dry up the supply of rented farms. Thataspect will be the Opposition's principal criterion in considering any new clause that is put down in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must now ask ourselves, in procedural terms, what will happen now. I welcome the Minister's statement that the Government's new clause will come before this Committee. That is extremely important. All of us must understandthat the effect either of new Clause 1, which the Minister is inviting his hon. Friends to withdraw, or possibly the Government's new clause, which wehave not yet seen, would be to create a major difference in the organisation of the countryside. That could cause a major difference in the landlord-tenant system, which the Minister said in his speech he wishes to strengthen. We shall want carefully to look at what is proposed and to consider it inthe light of the Minister's statement that he wishes to strengthen the landlord-tenant system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition believe that this is a matter for a separate Bill. Being as important as that, it is clear that such a matter could not possibly have jumped both the Second Reading and the Committee stage and been given birth to on Report. We therefore welcome the fact that we shall be able to give the proposed new clause a Second Reading here, that we shall have a chance to amend it, and that we shall not be put into the impossible position of having to consider it and possibly try to amend it on the Floor of the House on Report when, as we all know, there tends to be a rush and these matters are generally done in an unsatisfactory way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, will the Minister give us an assurance that when the Government's new clause is included on the Amendment Paner we shall have adequate time for consideration before it is debated in this Committee?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that this is an exceedingly
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>424</span>
important matter to the countryside in general, and therefore we must have at least a week, possibly more, in which to consider the implications of the Government's new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is getting a lot of advice from all round him—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the hon. Member not to worry. I am getting some advice, some good and some not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Looking at some of the hon. Gentlemen surrounding the Minister, I would not be a bit surprised if some of it is bad advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of these matters, we must have a good period of time between the tabling of the new clause and its consideration because, I am sure the Minister will understand, on a matter as fundamental and as important as this theOpposition must also have the opportunity to consult with the various bodies which are closely concerned with the matter. We shall need to have consultations before the tabling of the new clause, and afterwards. We shall needto consult the National Farmers' Union, the Country Landowners' Association, and many other bodies which have already expressed serious concern about this proposal. The Central Association of Agricultural Valuers has written me many letters. The Church Commissioners have a very strong interest in this matter. Indeed, the National Trust—a major landowner in my constituency and, I suspect, in the Minister's also—is most concerned about it. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors also has strong views. Of course, we shall have to consult the county councils because, through their smallholdings arrangements, they, too, are most concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was very concerned to hear what the Minister said this morning with regard to the county councils—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One law for the rich.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) has said. quite rightly, that the implication of what the Minister has said is that there would he one law for the county councils and another law altogether for everyone else. That is a very strange posture for the Minister to be adopting.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0238">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>425</span>
Putting that statement together with his previous statement that it is the Government's intention to strengthen the landlord-tenant system, could it be that the Government will take further steps in order to put more and moreland into the ownership of county councils so as to secure a massive expansion in the county councils. smallholdings system?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see how that would have been possible under the proposals which many of the Minister's hon. Friends want to bring in. Legislation of this sort would strengthen the landlord-tenant system without using this loophole which he has already jumped on to, with regard to allowing a special law forthe county councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful to the Committee if the Minister could give us further information about the Government's philosophy on this matter. The Minister threw in a remark to the effect that the Government intend to strengthen the landlord-tenant system. Can the Minister give an undertaking that the Government are determined not to take any steps which would dry up the supply of rented farms, which are the only way by which young men can get into farming?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall need to study the Government's new clause very carefully after it is laid. I hope the Minister will agree that, if necessary, after the Committee has completed its consideration of Clause 18, it might be best to adjourn for a Sitting or two—for a week or however long it may be necessary—so that the Government and the Opposition have time to consider the implications of what they are doing. As the Government intend to open up the whole question of the Agricultural Holdings Acts, the Minister will understand that some of my hon. Friends may also wish to discuss other matters concerned with those Acts. In this situation, I think that that is entirely reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is entirely unsuitable for major changes in the Agricultural Holdings Acts which is now being proposed. These proposals could have major repercussions on the landlord-tenant system. The Minister saying, on the one hand, that he wants to strengthen it but, on the other hand, proposing legislation of this sort, puts us in a most difficult situation. No one will argue that this approach by the Government is anything other than a piecemeal
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>426</span>
approach to the whole structure of Holdings Acts in the farming industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many other matters ready for review and possible change in this legislation. It would have been far better if the Government, instead of approaching us this morning in this way, had given an undertaking that they would introduce a comprehensive new Agricultural Holdings Act next Session. Itcould then have been done throughout the whole law in this sector, with adequate consultation with everyone concerned, and a much more satisfactory arrangement. Pending that we can only wait and reserve our judgment until theMinister presents the detailed new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) listed a large number of bodies which have written to him making representations about theproposed new clause. We have had representations from similar bodies, but the one group he seems to have omitted is the tenants themselves. I have heard from a large number of tenants. I wonder if the hon. Member has had their point of view in this matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman omitted them from his comprehensive list. It was contact from constituents, whether by letter or personally, that ledme to thinking about the issue of security of tenure. When the Bill was published we had correspondence from NFU headquarters commenting on the Bill before Second Reading. It was the NFU which drew attention to the fact that no provision was made in the Bill for security of tenure for families of tenant farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of those representations, some of us felt that such a provisionought to be included and that the Bill would be a suitable vehicle considering that similar legislation had been introduced in Scotland. We tabled a new clause. We felt, not that the new clause was entirely suitable, but thatit could certainly set our minds thinking about the exact type of legislation that we should need.

I understand that some hon. Members—not in this Committee—have referred to me and certain of my hon. Friends as "wild revolutionaries from the North". I object to being referred to as coming

"from the North" because I do not come from the North, but, even if we are thought to be wild revolutionaries I can assure the Committee that those who have asked me to try to do something about this are anything but revolutionaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A lot of steam has been generated on this question, but I am delighted to find a most responsible editorial in 	<i>The Times</i> which supports the view that something should be tried at this stage. The editorial of the 20th January said—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has referred to the article in 	<i>The Times</i>—a very good one, too—but the whole tenure of the article wasthat this matter should not be in this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>The Times</i> suggests that we ought to have something andthat there should be an opportunity at this stage to do something. The editorial goes into the arguments on both sides and says that the only way of finding out about the uncertainty is by trying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to delay matters further, I would suggest to the Opposition that we are unlikely to get legislation for a long time. There are no means of bringing in legislation at the drop of a hat. This Agriculture Bill is ready. I see no reason for delay. There has been considerable discussion since Second Reading and I cannot see that further discussion 	<i>ad infinitum</i> will improve matters. Sufficient time has been spent on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was delighted to hear my right hon. Friend's remarks. What he has said this morning covers the ground which concerns me. I look forward to the detail of his new clause, and I appreciate that he is bringing it forward in Committee so that amendments can be made to it, if necessary. However, I take exception to the remarks of the hon. Member for Westmorland. He tried to create the impression that the NFU is opposed to such legislation. Certainly,it has reservations about parts of the new clause, but it is not opposed tothe principle. In fact, it supports the principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman just said that he understands that the NFU is opposed to certain parts of his new clause. I am sorry if he did not hear what I said. I will repeat what Sir Henry Plumb said in his letter. He said that the NFU
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>428</span>
	<br><q><p>"will oppose the amendment put down by Government back-bench MPs".</p></q>
The hon. Gentleman can take that any way he likes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Read the rest of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member said that that letter was written in December. Will he recall the debate at the NFU conference on 21st January, when this subject was put to a committee, and that committee of the NFU decided unanimously to support legislation which would provide security of tenure? Will the hon. Member now put his remarks into context? Certainly the NFU mighthave opposed that new clause, but it does not necessarily oppose the principle. He ought to put that straight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give wholehearted support to my right hon. Friend in his endeavours to bring in the new clause. I support him in that he needs to consult various agencies, but will he try to ensure that tenant farmers also have a say in this matter? Far too often agencies which take the opposite view have a say and are not defending the interests of tenant farmers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the right hon. Gentleman a few questions about his statement? He as a Minister is a landlord on a large scale, and I am sure he isaware that his tenants are in my constituency. When I raised the matter in the House a few years ago he then had just over 1,000 tenants. I think the number is appreciably less now. I want to ask him about them, because I spent last weekend talking to a fair number of them. I therefore have an advantage of which he has deprived himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first question is to ask him to be good enough to consult his own tenants before he introduces the new clause. Some years ago I alleged that he wasan absentee landlord. I hope that I never have to say that again about the right hon. Gentleman, but I think it would be wise if he were to visit his tenants, of whom he has a large number. Some of them have only 10 or 15 acres to farm. Is he aware that he has imposed clauses in their leases to the effect that they shall not farm any other land and that they shall not rentany other land? Does he understand how onerous such a clause is upon a tenant? Does he understand how difficult it is in this modern age to earn a living on 10, 15 or 20 acres?
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0240">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>429</span>
We have moved on from the Black Death when landlords did impose such clauses, would it not be fair to allow such tenants to rent other land, or even own other land?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the Minister consider how old some of his tenants are now? Does he realise that the average age of his tenants is now quite appalling? Many are now over 70. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman would listen while I give himthe reason why so many are over 70. It is because they have sons to follow them and they would like their sons to take over the holdings, especially when the sons have been doing all the work. When I say all the work, I am not exaggerating. These are old men who are nominally the tenants, but their sons are now doing all the work, getting up every morning at 5 or earlier to work all the day, working that tenancy that they have been given by the Minister. Those old men who are his tenants dare not surrender the lease, because they know that the chance of their son taking it over is remote and is in doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can quote four cases in the past few years where the Minister has not given the tenancy to the son, although the son has continued to work that small farm for several years. The Minister may laugh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not laughing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister is listening, because this is a serious matter. In all the years he has been the Minister of Agriculture he has never visited his tenants—he has never yet come to grips with the problems they have. It is a serious matter when he has hundreds of tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that some of these holdings have been amalgamated, but many of them are still small. It is harshly onerous to have clauses inserted that noprivate landlord would dare to insert. If the Minister denies that, I put this question to him: can he name one private landlord in this country who would insert the kind of onerous clauses that he inserts in his tenancy agreements to this day? The one I have particularly in mind stipulates that histenants should not have any other land, even though the holding may be verysmall, and that they should not even have any other occupa-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>430</span>
tion such as driving a lorry part-time or anything else to supplement theirlivelihood. hey are forced to live on these very small holdings and have noother job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will answer these questions. What he has said thismorning is "I, as the Minister of Agriculture, have such a white sheet thatI can be above this law, so we shall have a new law which will require private landlords to submit to this new procedure." That may be right. But if it is right, why cannot it apply to the Minister's own tenants, of whom there are hundreds? They are being treated very badly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Miss Maynard) will support me, because some of these tenants are members of her union. They arenot members of the National Farmers' Union. Some of them are very small tenants indeed. There is now considerable simmering amongst these tenants. I spent the whole of Saturday meeting some of the Minister's tenants, and I can assure him that there is considerable ill-feeling. Of course, these tenants are on the borders of the Wash and are rather inaccessible, but it is time that the Minister ceased to be an absentee landlord and paid them a visit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, my first question is, above all: will the Minister be good enough to visit his own tenants and hear first hand from them how they feel about this new clause and how they will be affected? If he cannot do that, in due course, when the new clause is moved, will he give convincing reasons, not justto this Committee but to his tenants, as to why they should be put in a worse position than other tenants, and why he as a Minister should be in a privileged position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

thanks to my right hon. Friend for his statement this morning. It will be welcomed by this side of the Committee and by the Government. More important, it will be welcomed by many agriculture interests, above all by farmers, especially tenant farmers. I also welcome the statement made by the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling), because clearly he is not opposing the principle of the new clause; and this has been the crux of the matter over the past few months. We welcome his U-turn. We hope that we shall have a useful Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman was not listening. All I said was that, until we see the Government's new clause, we shall withhold our judgment. I said that it could be immensely damaging to the countryside and,until we see it, it would be foolish for us to make a prior judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, one half of my reason for recognising the U-turn was the phrase "We are withholding our judgment". The other half was the nature of the criticism; because, when people are afraid to attack the substance of a clause, they attack the parliamentary form in which it is presented. There has been no criticism of the concepts included in the Minister's speech, but we have heard comments such as "We have not had time to consider the new clause". We have had the new clause on the Amendment Paper for several weeks. We have been arguing about it in the corridors. They have been arguing about it in the corridors of power, which includes, among other places, the Country Landowners' Association. It is not true that they have not been considering it. But no, the Opposition say they are not objecting to the subject, but only to the parliamentary form, having it brought in the middle of the Committee. That is tantamount to saying "There should be more legislation. Let us have bigger legislation. Let us have a bigger Bill. Let us wait." So the objection is not to the substance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the U-turn. The objection is piecemeal It is said that the objectors should be on a committee. One proposition was that there should be a delay for a week or two on the Committee. The Opposition say" Let us postpone
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>432</span>
the Committee or delay it for a week or two so that we can start considering the sudden new shock that we have had", and this despite the fact that the new clause has been on the Amendment Paper for months. So the attitude really is" Let us delay it even further to the point of procrastination until the new Parliamentary Session or concentrate and comment on parliamentary form to avoid a commitment on the substance."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also welcome wholeheartedly the statement made by the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body). He could not have made the case better for us than he did. None of us could have made the case better. He used as his keypoint the age of the farmers, th e age of the tenants hanging on because oftheir fear that their sons will not get the holding. This is a deplorable situation. We have support for this from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors which states that because of
	<br><q><p>"increase in tenant's age structure. Old tenants hang on in the hope that ason will inherit".</p></q>
In their fear that this will increase the tenants' age structure, because old tenants hang on in the hope that a son will inherit, the Institution is suggesting that we do not pass legislation to make sure that the son will have the opportunity. If anything, the argument gives a very wide spectrum of support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point I put to the right hon Gentleman was that, taking the national figures, it is clear that his tenants hang on much longer than others. They are old men, because they are scared.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcomed the U-turn. The Opposition want, not to make a U-turn, but to broaden the concept to include the Minister's tenants. Of course we shall look for broader aspects. We may have other amendments which will broaden it even further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not charge the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) with raising a real point. The hon. Member for Holland with Boston did raise two realpoints—should there be an exception, and the question of the small size of existing holdings. He did not develop that point, but it lay at the back of what he said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my right hon. Friend will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0242">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>433</span>
consider smallholdings carefully in his reply. There is a distinction between a landlord—technically responsible to no one but himself who decides that A rather than B should have a tenancy—and those who administer small holdings, whether county councils, the local authorities or the Minister, who are subject to public scrutiny and public control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, therefore, clearly a case for that which has been established in getting new tenants entry into farming. That which is administered publiclyshould be considered in a different way from that which is not subject to such control. Indeed, when we are trying to bring in such control objectionsare made. There is a clear case for distinction. Whether the distinction should follow in exactly the way that my right hon. Friend has suggested I donot know—we have hardly seen the clause. But clearly there is a special case which must be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One possible way would be to apply it to the smallholding aspect, to apply it to ministerial tenancies, but perhaps to have a local authority representative present at the Land Tribunal so that public responsibility can be taken into consideration by the Land Tribunal. Clearly there is a distinctionthere. I have accepted your strictures, Mr. Costain, and I shall not go into the merits of the matter. But I want to pick up one or two points which have been made today and on an earlier occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to pick up the amalgamation aspect. The hon. Member for Holland with Boston did not develop that. We have to look at this, and possibly we failed to consider it sufficiently in the new clause we tabled. Clearly the size of the holding must be considered. Amalgamation will be one of theconsiderations for the Land Tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hereditary principle has been argued back and forth. I want to make a solid, simple distinction, not of heredity in the normal sense of ownership but the small shopkeeper alongside whom his son has worked all his life and who can reasonably expect to continue the business. This is the criterion I would apply, not the normal crude hereditary principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) referred to the small cell
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>434</span>
of Labour MPs. Some small cell! It will be some small cell when we have a vote on my hon. Friend's new clause. I have no doubt about that. Indeed, we shall have Opposition Members supporting us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) need not be worried about being accused of being a revolutionary northerner. To the hon. Member for Hendon, North all points west of Hendon, North are north. But,because I have already been called an agricultural anarchist, because of the same clauses, we can choose which cell we wish to be in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are all Celts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we come to the discussion on the clause, I hope that the continual argument will not prevail and that it will not be said that this is the wrong way of doing it. A clear indication was given by the Minister when replying to the debate that this was seriously to be considered. An amendment was put down within a week of Second Reading, so the thing was on the cards. We have brought it forward to the Committee, the Minister has now taken responsibility for it, and it will have full Committee discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have been deprived of a glorious opportunity of stating where they stand on the basic principle by having a Second Reading debate on it. That can come in the debate on " Clause stand part". We look forward withinterest to hearing whether their objections, now based on parliamentary procedure, will be continued into an objection to the substance of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to try to confine my remarks to one matter. Let us try to look at this in a balanced way. I act, as I have said before and do not want to over-emphasise, on both sides of the agricultural line, tenant and landlord. The Parliamentary Secretary, who I know is passionately devoted to this principle, should not forget that in England there are many tenants who would not wish to have the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spent my whole life trying to draw together agriculture as agriculture—landlord, tenant and agricultural worker—and I believe that it would be the greatest possible disservice to the agricultural industryif we did not look at the clause seriously to try to improve

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>435</span>
landlord-tenant relations. It is quite wrong not to bring it into this Act,because five years before I became a Member of Parliament we were being promised amendments to the Agricultural Holdings Act. Every Government have been at fault in not bringing this forward long ago. I urged my hon. and right hon. Friends, when we were in Government, to bring something forward, because I know that the professions and everybody want to widen the scope of arrangements between those who own land and those who farm land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that other countries can give us ideas as to how this can be done. There is great scope for long leases of 25 or 30 years which terminate. This would be a way of helping to keep the landlord-tenant arrangement going, because of the immense capital that is needed to buy land and to farm it.The great thing should be to try to split the capital. If we are to have ithere, I am grateful to the Minister for bringing it forward in Committee and not on Report. It gives us an opportunity to think the thing out. I know that the Celts, the West and the North feel strongly about this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a large number of county council smallholding tenants in my area.I have been on a county council smallholdings committee for about 21 years,and I know that always the son is considered strongly. Nevertheless, there are great problems, and I know how the County Councils Association and my own authority feel about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we come to discuss the clause, I hope that the Minister will give us plenty of time, as my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) said, to discuss the matter for the benefit of agriculture as a whole and not from some partisan point of view. I refuse to be associated with one sideor the other. Both tenants and landlords feel strongly, but they do not allfall on one or other side of the fence. I hope that, when we consider the clause, we shall be allowed to consider it carefully and shall not fall intothe error of making only partisan points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Joan Maynard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's statement that he intends to introduce his own new clause, because I think that it will help those who
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>436</span>
actually do the job in the industry. As the hon. Member for Norfolk, South West(Mr. Hawkins) has just said, I think that it will be in the interests of agriculture as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome, too, the qualified support given by the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling), because, when he spoke on Second Reading, I felt that hespoke much more for the country landowners than he did for the farmers. Hon. Members opposite will have to decide, when the clause is put to the vote,whose side they are on—the side of the landlords or the side of the farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question has been asked whether the supply of rented land will dry up if the new clause is introduced. I ask in all sincerity, because I do not know the answer, whether the supply of rented land may already be drying up. We have heard much about the views of certain people. I can only say that the tenants from whom I have heard very much welcome the clause and are anxious for it to become part of an Act. I can also say that one tenant writes to me in confidence, because of a fear that, if the landowner should get to know—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Come on. The hon. Lady has been making this speech for years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Maynard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can produce the letter. The tenant is afraid that, if the landowner gets to know his views on the clause, he will in some way be victimised. That sort of situation ought not to be current in our society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the tenants' attitude to New Clause 1, perhaps the question we ought to ask tenants is, " Do they want their sons evicted? " That is really the point at issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the point made by the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) about the Minister as a landlord, I agree that those tenants should have exactly the same kind of protection as private tenants, and I think it very wrong, for instance, that the amount of land they can rent should be restricted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end by saying again how much I welcome the Minister coming here this morning and saying that he will introduce a new clause if we withdraw our new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to echo what my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0244">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>437</span>
said. The balance of the landlord-tenant relationship is very delicate indeed. We, who are landlords must disregard the remarks of the hon. Member forSheffield, Brightside (Miss Maynard). I hope that I am one of the enlightened landlords to whom the Minister referred. I certainly have never refused a tenant's son the succession. To upset the balance is quite a different matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister is right to suggest that new Clause 1 should bewithdrawn. As my hon. Friend says, we must wait and see what the Minister brings forward. However, he has changed his tune about the Bill being the right vehicle for discussion of this sort. This is the point that we have made from Second Reading onwards. People want devolution in this country because it is plain that we are governed by Celts in practically everything we do. This is where the demand is coming from—not from us poor people in England We have to take the rub. But that is by the way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I fire warning shots across the Minister's bows? The first concerns thepoint already made about local authority tenants. Like my hon. Friend, I served for nearly eight years on a smallholdings committee of a county counciand l know of the pressures and cases that arise. Hard cases make bad law. This is something which, on this point, we have to remember. We have all seen the 	<i>Tribune</i> article about one gentleman in Wales, which is, I understand, totally erroneous. Therefore, when we come to the point about local authority tenants, what is sauce for the goose is clearly sauce for the gander.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is most important. The Minister must appreciate that, if he goes beyond the one-life contract—and I agree with my hon. Friend that we ought to consider other forms of tenancy—to extend the lifetime of a tenancy, two things, without a shadow of doubt, will happen. The first is that the value of rented land will drop like a stone. The second isthat the value of land with vacant possession will rise proportionately
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have just imposed stringent taxation on landlords in particular—because they receive no relief on agricultural land. No adviser,when there is a case of whether a farm
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>438</span>
should be let, would possibly advise,in those circumstances, that the farm should be relet. He would be failing in his duty as an adviser, if he were so to advise. Every one of the vast concourse of people sitting round this room this morning advising the Minister knows that to be true. Therefore, those two points must be borne in mind. Otherwise he will be doing a great dis-service to agriculture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must declare my interest. I am a tenant-farmer. I have two sons and one daughter. I have never owned any agricultural land let to a tenant and at present see no prospect of so doing. I am wholly and totally opposed to the proposition based on the Minister's statement. But I shallcertainly support his motion, in that it will allow at least a better drafted clause to be considered by the Committee. The advice we have received isthat the new clause as on the Amendment Paper is totally unworkable and even the hon. Gentleman who assisted in promoting it would accept that it was tabled merely to spur the Government on to action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sadly, the Government have responded to that spur with no great understanding of the implications of what they have done. The Minister has wiped many millions of pounds off the value of agricultural land that is left to tenants. He knows that to be the case and that a good deal of that land is held by pension funds and large trade unions as an investment. That land is now worth considerably less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his speech on Second Reading, the Parliamentary Secretary castigated me for not knowing that consultations had taken place with, among others, the CLA, the NFU and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. I am well aware that those consultations have been taking place over a long period. I want to know why, when there are consultations which produce a multitude of advice on this landlord-tenant legislation, the Government have chosen to select only one part of it. Many of the other amendments and alterations which are beneficial to both landlord and tenant have not been included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why the Opposition want a major review of this legislation. To do it by bits and pieces is disgraceful. Will the Minister press ahead with Clauses 11
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0245">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>439</span>
to 14? He said that he would be strengthening the methods of allowing landlords to regain possession. Does he think that those clauses will do that? If he changes his mind on those, it will save me a considerable amount of trouble in preparing my amendments. But we would welcome withdrawal of those clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, what will happen about my rent? My landlord has made it clear that, in the review of rents which is forthcoming for most of the tenants on my estate, he will have to take into account the fact that he can no longer gain possession and that he cannot foresee a date when he will have the capital available to finance, for example, capital transfer tax and other issues that will arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is no good the Parliamentary Secretary scoffing, because these are day-to-day problems which tenant-farmers have to face. He will appreciate that, as fewer and fewer farms are let, the tender rates go up and up, and arbitrators take those as a yardstick. Far from assisting tenants, this move will make the tenant's life economically infinitely more difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the only Liberal Minister on this Committee, I welcome the new clause. In my view, it has been long overdue and I am delightedthat the Minister will introduce a new clause and in opportune time we shall discuss it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In principle, I agree and I believe that, over a period of time after we are able to discuss the implications and benefits that will accrue from the Bill, agricultural production will increase. I hope that the Minister will clarify a matter that has worried me somewhat regarding county council smallholdings. I had the privilege of being a member of the smallholdings committee in Cardiganshire for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us are aware that the county councils did a great deal of good in trying to help young farmers to climb the ladder in the agricultural industry. The Minister has not mentioned the common grazings or the Crown Estates that we have in our part of the world. There are many tenants who have grazing rights only on the common land in mid-Wales and I hope the Minister will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>440</span>
be able to clarify this position
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the new clause will be introduced in the near future and that it will create good will between landlords and tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because I know that the Minister wants to have at least 10 minutes to reply before the end of this sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe it is a timetable or procedural motion that has been moved, but Iam deeply concerned that, in considering whatever new clause or amendment the Minister intends to table, the whole balance of the tenant-landlord relationship will be disturbed to the detriment of agriculture. Most OppositionMembers believe that the present landlord-tenant legislation needs a major review but that this particular Bill is not the instrument for that review. I share that view and emphasise it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My remarks will be that much shorter, Mr. Costain, if you permit me to read an extract from a letter which my colleague the hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Shepherd) has received from one of his constituents—Mr. Price, of 18 Callowside, Ewyasharold, Pontrilas, Hereford. Mr. Price hopes that theConservative Opposition in the Committee will oppose the new clause. The letter reads:
	<br><q><p>"I retired in 1962, through ill health and family tragedy. I let my farm ona yearly basis without the knowledge of the 1947-48 Agricultural Act applying. This little farm of 62 acres is my only life saving. I am now 83 years of age and my wife is nearly 76. We had the pleasure of meeting the hon. Member for Hereford".</p></q>
He names the people with whom he met my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter continues:
	<br><q><p>"In 1959 my son Leslie was working for a contractor ploughing a very steep field when the tractor overturned pinning my son underneath. The acid from the batteries poured on to his face, leaving him totally blind. My son was only 19 years of age then.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>My son, referred to, was married to his nurse when in hospital, who has twogrown sons, one of which says he will never leave them and my son would like our farm, which he knows so well, being his home.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>I asked my tenant if he would agree, although he was the man my son worked for when the accident occurred. And to my surprise none of his men were insured. But he has refused.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>I have felt for some time that I am compelled to try and explain the effectthe 1947-

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>441</span>
48 Agricultural Holdings Act has had on my family. I can only hope and pray that when the Conservatives are returned to power, they will abolish this Act."</p></q>
Now comes the crunch, Mr. Costain, and this is why I have quoted this letter:
	<br><q><p>"I believe any Government before passing any legislation should consider very carefully the effect it will have on every section of the community."</p></q>
That is the important point. Those affected are not just the tenants farming. but those that own land, particularly this gentleman and his family who have been placed in such an unpleasant and unfortunate position by the existing legislation. We believe that the whole landlord-tenant matter requiresurgent review. This is not the instrument for doing it. It should not be done in piecemeal manner by a new Bill in the next Session.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a very good debate. Some heat has been generated and I shall deal with some of the points, although my time is now limited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the support, in principle, of the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton). I have the impression that he supports the principleof what I am trying to achieve but that he would have liked to have had a major Act by itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to thank also the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells), whois a farmer and knows the industry well. I hope that he will not take offence at the taunts of this being a Celtic measure. I come from the North of England—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the right hon. Gentleman a Celt?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a Celtic wife, but I am a Northern Englishman. I believe that what we are doing is right, in the interests of the farming community and, specifically, in the interests of tenant farmers. There may be arguments about why I changed my mind—the U-turn mentioned by the Opposition spokesman. I do not mind that. He is a foolish man who sees danger ahead and does not try to avoid it. The hon. Gentleman would have made a bad soldier had he followed the philosophy which he has preached this morning. One has to recognise when one can win. But I believe that in the end—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>442</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I believe that we shall win a better system because of the action which has been taken. On Second Reading my hon. Friend said:
	<br><q><p>"But I am glad to be able to assure the House that we would carefully consider any new clause introduced in Committee."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st December 1975; Vol. 901, 	<i>c.</i> 1352.]</p></q>
My hon. Friend the Member for Durham (Mr. Hughes) thanked him for that assurance
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member knows that we have been consulting, and I have also consulted hon. Members on procedure through the usual channels, as I thought was right and proper. I am grateful that they will not oppose this procedural motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already had consultations, and I shall continue to have them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us deal with specific points quickly. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) for his views, and I am gladthat he will recommend his hon. Friends to withdraw the new clause from theAmendment Paper. I know his constituency. He represents an important agricultural community and has many tenant farmer constituents. He said that he was a revolutionary—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been accused of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing wrong with being a revolutionary. It is sometimes better than being a traditionalist. There must be social change, and here is one case where we are following the Scots on a matter which was recommended to us to by the National Farmers' Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no good the hon. Member reading one letter from Sir Henry Plumb. Sir Henry Plumb has made public speeches. I have here the official brief of theNational Farmers' Union, which was circulated to hon. Members. On the subject of possible succession to tenancies, the union said:
	<br><q><p>"It is, however, regretted that the Government has not—so far at anyrate—taken the opportunity of including in this Bill provisions to afford to the sons and near relatives of tenant farmers in England and Walesa comparable right to that already existing in Scotland to seek to succeed to the tenancy on the death of the tenant."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Read on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will right through it. It it a long statement. The union has come out in principle for what I shall recommend. The hon. Member for Westmorland knows full well that I am right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On exactly that point, moving on to a question I asked the Minister, page 3 of the union's brief says:
	<br><q><p>"The Union is naturally most anxious that any change in the law on this subject should not detrimentally affect the supply of farms to let".</p></q>
Will the Minister give an undertaking that that will be part of Government policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is why I believe that what the union is saying is a right thing to ask for. I believe that I can give that assurance. I believe that we shall improve the situation for a great section of farming opinion, and that is what I want to do.

The hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) got rather excited aboutmy farms in his area. I never heard him being passionate when my predecessors, who were of a different political faith, were in charge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never heard that on the Floor of the House. But I shall certainly consult and examine. Incidentally, the model agreement is actually in the Library of the House. I hope that the hon. Member will look at it carefully. Certainly, I shall consult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) supported me.He discussed many matters which I cannot follow up, including important questions of amalgamations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) asked me to look at the matter in a balanced way. I have tried to do that. When my scheme is presented, I think that the hon. Member will have difficulty in opposing it. But I believe we should consider it in relation to what is good for the industry. I am not arguing a partisan point of view, because I know that peopleof different political persuasions have different opinions on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Miss Maynard), who knows the industry well through long experience in the Agricultural
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>444</span>
Workers' Union, as an official and as an organiser, knows that in the Northof England this will be welcomed by tenant farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) said that he was an enlightenedlandlord. I shall not harm him if he is an enlightened landlord; he will goon being one. I am sure he will not object. He referred to Celts. I do not want any racial discrimination on the Bill. I want Celts, Angles and Saxonsto support it, and I am sure they will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I believe that what we do will be supported by a large section of the agricultural community, and for that reason I beg to ask leave towithdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain. I suggest that the Question be now put. I wonder if the opportunity might be given to the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) to withdraw the wrong analysis he gave from theNFU statement earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have just a moment before the Question need be put. I hope that my Friends will not oppose the Government when they shout " No " to the Question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has made an important statement this morning, particularly in his winding up remarks, when he said that he was able to give us an undertaking that the aim of the Government would be that the legislation would notdetrimentally affect the supply of farms to let. This is a helpful and important statement to qualify his previous remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have one minute. I hope that the Minister will agree that his proposal cannot be divorced from other Government measures, whether it be the proposed wealth tax that has been put on ice, the capital transfer tax or other measures.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is natural that hon. Members who have been concentrating their attention on the important statement made by my right hon. Friend will take time to adjust themselves to Clause 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not need to speak at length on the amendments, because they have been tabled for the purpose of ensuring that, whenever an Order is made designating an area within which the destruction of members of a species of wild life is necessary, it will be possible to restrict
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>446</span>
this destruction to those localities inside the area where the disease problem currently exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are tidying up amendments to make perfectly clear beyond all shadow of doubt that, when an area has been designated in an Order, it does not necessarily mean that all members of the wild life species within that area will have to be destroyed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will accept my assurance that these amendments are intended to ensure that unnecessary destruction of wild life can be avoided, and that all the amendments will be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: it is very inconvenient, as the Parliamentary Secretary has indicated, to start on these important amendments right at the endof a somewhat tense and emotional debate on the Minister's statement.
