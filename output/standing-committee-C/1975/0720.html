QUALIFICATIONS OF AUDITORS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed—[15th July</i>]—No. 110, in "2(A)(<i>a</i>) If on the request of a body that it be added to subsection (1) above the Secretary of State refuses, or delays for a period exceeding six months, to comply with the request he shall, if required by that body, state in writing the reason for the refusal or delay, and the body may appeal to the Privy Council;
<br><blockquote><p>(<i>b</i>)on any such appeal the Privy Council, after communication with the Secretary of State, may dismiss or_uphold the appeal, and if the appeal is upheld the Secretary of State shall make regulations under this section to give effect thereto".—[<i>Mr.Ford.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Clinton Davis)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it may be as well if I were to rehearse further my principal reasons, which I reiterated at the last sitting, for opposing this Amendment.<br><br>
First of all, I made the point that essentially what was in issue was an administrative decision and not one which was judicial and as far as I know there are no statutes which provide for an appeal to the Privy Council from a decision of a Minister of the Crown. There is an appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council from decisions of certain professional bodies, for example, those involving doctors, dentists, veterinary surgeons and opticians, but these are disciplinary cases involving individual and not administrative decisions of Ministers about bodies corporate.<br><br>
That was the point I was seeking to make last time. I perhaps inadvertently mis-stated the position and perhaps I ought to clear that up. The question of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 314</span>
the refusing of admission to bodies is perhaps a little more in issue and I do not think I ought to be quite so emphatic in stating that the main burden of my remarks still remain.<br><br>
I was saying, secondly, that it was desirable that the ultimate decision for the case of recognition under Section 161(1)(a) of the 1948 Act should rest with the Secretary of State because the decision inevitably involves consideration of examination standards and there would be factors on which it would be difficult for a judicial body to decide. If there were to be an appeal this would take out of the hands of the Secretary of State a decision involving not a single individual but perhaps hundreds of people, together with the interests of creditors and shareholders generally, which should remain uppermost in the mind of the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terence Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite clear what creditors and shareholders have to do with whether there should be an appeal against the Secretary of State's decision as to whether a particular auditing body should be authorised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: t is because they are ultimately concerned with the standards of auditing and to that extent if standards are diminished one might be diminishing the rights of shareholders and creditors.<br><br>
I would add that it would also reduce parliamentary accountability substantially because an independent tribunal could not be questioned about its decisions and it might also exclude the jurisdiction of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration which is something which would be most undesirable.<br><br>
Then I made the further point that in any event, because the Privy Council would have no specific expertise in the matter, it would be obliged to seek advice from the Secretary of State for Trade himself concerning appeals against his own decision. That would be a logical absurdity.<br><br>
I want to stress the point that applications under Section 161(1)(a) are dealt with and have been dealt with by successive Governments with fairness. A decision is invariably taken at ministerial level after most careful consideration of the points made by an applicant.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0838">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 315</span>
The broad criteria concerning the consideration of applications are made known to an applicant, as are the reasons for rejection, and officials are always willing to discuss with a body obstacles to recognition and steps to overcome them. Provisions under Subsection (2) of the clause should give even greater guarantees that an applicant will be heard fairly. I think these are fairly substantial reasons for not accepting the amendment.<br><br>
I stress that we are talking here of bodies, not of the rights of the individual against what they might consider to be unfair procedures that have been applied in relation to disciplinary matters. I summarise the matter by saying that in my submission the amendment is not only unprecedented but also unworkable and it would not be in the public interest to make fundamental changes in the application of Section 161(1)(a). The ultimate decision should rest with the Secretary of State and, because of the reasons I have submitted, it would not be appropriate for these decisions to be operated by the Privy Council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a difficult amendment in many ways because there is a growing concern on both sides of the House, and I suspect, on Front Benches as well as on Back Benches about the extension of ministerial power and the power of the Executive. It is absolutely right we in the House of Commons should seek, whenever appropriate, to curb that increase in Executive power. I have listened with great interest to the matters raised by the hon. Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Ford). I intervened a moment ago to clarify one point because the Minister was stressing that the amendment might have implications for the interests of shareholders and creditors. He is absolutely right that it is the case that the general standard of auditing is of very great importance to shareholders and creditors and I had not realised he was discussing the matter on such a very wide base. It is our desire the standard on auditing should not only be maintained but improved.<br><br>
There was slight confusion—perhaps the hon. Member for Bradford, North,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 316</span>
would clarify this later—at the last sitting about which precise body we were talking about. We discussed in a previous amendment the British Association of Accountants and Auditors and I think the Minister spelt out the position on that. We will be having further consultations with that body to see what its reaction is to the Minister's reply. As far as I can establish, apart from that body, which we were discussing on an earlier amendment, the body which we are really concerned about here—if I understand the matter correctly—is the Association of International Accountants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I say again, and it will be found in the report in <i>Hansard</i> last week, that I am not in this amendment encouraging any special pleading for any particular body. I am moving this amendment as a matter of principle so that anybody at any time may have a proper course of appeal from the decisions of the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that point and I think one must look at it in the context in which we are debating this amendment. I referred at the last sitting to a copy of <i>The Accountant</i> of 8th July this year which listed various accountancy bodies. Four of them are actually covered by the clause. There was the Association of Accountants and Auditors—and that has already been covered—the Institute of Cost and Management Accountants and the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, and the Society of Company and Commercial Accountants—which was quite recently formed. They are not directly affected, as I understand it, by this clause. Therefore that leaves the one I referred toa moment ago.<br><br>
Far be it from me to raise the dreaded word "hybridity" but I think it is at least arguable that what we are really dealing with here is such a case. If that is so, if there has been undue delay and so on in reaching a ministerial decision, it is right that that matter should be fully ventilated. But it would probably be wrong on a point as important as this to try to deal with a particular case by a general clause, which is only likely to affect a single body, or perhaps two. It may be that others are affected as well but it is my impression that they are not particularly affected by this amendment as far as auditing is concerned.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0839">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 317</span>
That said, the point we have to consider is the one which the Minister has raised about whether this is precedented and workable. Of course it is the case that in difficult areas, for example with planning permissions and the decisions of the Civil Aviation Authority, there is an appeal to the Minister but there is not then some further appeal to some other body. In his speech in support of the amendment the hon. Member for Bradford, North suggested that there was a similar situation with regard to a number of other bodies—what might be called trade associations. I do not think the Minister actually replied to that particular point and it would be helpful if he was to do so. I would hesitate, at any rate at this stage in the proceedings, to support this because it seems to me that if we are creating a precedent it is something which needs to be considered in the much broader context of the general authorisation of professional bodies of all sorts. There is a large number of them.<br><br>
It would be difficult, if we were simply to place the accountancy bodies in a position in regard to this legislation which no other professional body enjoys, but I do not think that the Minister made clear what the position is for the various other professional bodies, whether they be insurance brokers or ship-brokers, lawyers or whatever. I would hope therefore that he can give some further reasons for that. Certainly my feeling at this stage is it would be wrong to put this group in a unique position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I follow the point the hon. Member is asking me to elucidate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bradford, North, in moving his amendment, suggested that a similar procedure applied with the right of appeal to the Privy Council for a number of other bodies.<br><br>
He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The amendment would enable an appeal to be brought to the Privy Council. It follows, or is to some extent based on, Section 24(2) of the Medical Act 1952. The majority, if not all, of the enactments dealing with professional qualifications allow a right of appeal in matters affecting the right of a person to practise a profession, examples being found in the Architects (Registration) Act 1931, the Opticians Act 1958 and the Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act 1960."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee C,</i>15th July, 1976; c. 301.]</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 318</span>
Now, if that is indeed the case, and the thing is on all fours it puts a different complexion on the matter. If that is the case the Minister has an obligation to reply specifically to the points made by his hon. Friend. The crucial point is whether we are putting this category of qualification in a unique position. I understand the Minister's argument is that we are and if we are we need to look at it and in a broader context. We would want to see why accountants should be in a special position. But if all these other bodies do have a right of appeal to the Privy Council we are simply adding one more to the list. That is a different proposition. That is really the crux of the matter and I hope the Minister can give a detailed reply on it.<br><br>
As to the suitability of the Privy Council for this task, it is not the Privy Council as such which would be concerned but the Judicial Council of the Privy Council. The crucial question is whether the matter is justiciable—which I think is the right expression. The House has always been very reluctant to place on the Privy Council, in its judicial capacity, matters which are not strictly speaking justiciable. I think that was true with the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1958. My initial feeling is that the amendment would create a precedent and would not really give a right of appeal to the most suitable body. Maybe we can devise some more suitable appeal between now and Report stage.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
One final point deals with the first part of the amendment which is concerned with the reasons for the rejection being published. The Minister has said that the body which applies is always given the reasons. I am not sure whether this should be more widely available or whether it would be desirable. I found myself more attracted to that part of the amendment than I did to the second part in respect of an appeal to the Privy Council. This is a serious matter on which we need to give thought and I hope that the Minister will clarify the position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Shersby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an interesting amendment which raises a number of important considerations. There is little doubt that these days many people, perhaps even in professional bodies, feel that there is some need for the opportunity to appeal to some other body against decisions which are taken by Secretaries
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0840">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 319</span>
of State. My hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) has referred to planning appeals where, of course, the appellant can appeal to the Secretary of State in the case of a planning application which has been rejected by his local authority. In that context the Secretary of State acts in a quasi-judicial capacity. The appellant also has the right of appeal to the High Court on a point of law if a point of law can be shown to be involved in the planning decision. In the case of planning appeals, at any rate, there is a right of an appeal to a body outside the jurisdiction of the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What we are talking about, and the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) put it in a nutshell, is the question of authorisation for practising in a profession. On the question of planning appeals, there is the right of an individual, or an incorporated company, to make an appeal. In effect, it is an individual decision which is being dealt with. I think there is a difference.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shersby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to the Minister. It need not necessarily be an individual decision because it may be a planning application of an organisation or corporate body, although I accept that is not a particularly good analogy. What we are trying to do is differentiate between the right of appeal against an administrative decision taken by the Secretary of State on the basis of expert advice which he has received from his advisers and maladministration which, of course, is a matter for the Ombudsman. I wish to direct my attention to the question whether there should be some right of appeal against an administrative decision taken by the Secretary of State on grounds other than maladministration. That is a difficult matter to deal with. t is one that requires considerable thought.<br><br>
It is right to say that today there is a growing body of opinion which feels that there ought to be some opportunity to appeal above the head of the Secretary of State in certain cases. Whether this is the right place for us to make an innovation is a matter for debate. I would like a little more information about what other activities the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council deals with in relation to appeals by professional bodies or by individuals who are members of professional bodies.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 320</span>
Perhaps the Minister can give us a little more information on that point. I seem to recall, though I could easily be wrong, that medical practitioners have some right of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council although, if that is the case, it is quite different to the kind of amendment that we are considering now.<br><br>
Their appeal would be over the head, presumably, of the British Medical Association rather than over the head of the Secretary of State. The hon. Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Ford) has raised a number of interesting points which it has been worth while debating this morning. I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say in amplification of the points which have already been made, and which may be made, during the course of the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an interesting debate because of its implications which go outside company law on accountants. We have to reach a decision and the question raises important constitutional points in relation to the limits of bureaucratic power and the extent to which the public official can be accepted as the final arbitrator as to what is to happen in business, industry and commerce. There is the old phrase that we can leave it to the gentleman in Whitehall because he knows best. When one repeats that phrase it generally gives rise to derision and rage. The Civil Service must be warned that if it tries to take its powers and influence too far it will lose the confidence and support of public opinion. There are all too many signs that this is happening already. This seems to be another instance where the gentleman in Whitehall does not, and cannot, know best. In my opinion we should support this amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that one must distinguish between the various gentlemen in Whitehall. There are two categories, first, the civil servants and secondly, Ministers accountable to this House. The decision, as it stands, will be for the Secretary of State. It will not be for the bureaucracy and that is an important distinction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Rhys Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With all due deference to my hon. Friend I must tell that to my friends in the Marines. I simply cannot accept that the Secretary of State will take the decision on the basis of his personal knowledge or that he is likely to defy the report which comes to him from his
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0841">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 321</span>
Department in a case of this kind. If he does it will be because of political considerations rather than purely professional ones.<br><br>
It is highly unlikely that within the Department there will be anyone in a senior position with recent and relevant practical experience. It may well be that the Department will contain people who are qualified under the examinations of one or other of the bodies, either outside or inside the magic circle, but it is highly unlikely that anyone in a senior position in the Department will be completely up-to-date with the practice of the audit and the skills and professional knowledge required in changing circumstances. Nor can the Department readily obtain impartial advice from outside because either it will have to consult the bodies who have been placed in a monopoly position, who naturally, will not be enthusiastic about extending the monopoly to a competitive institution; or it must consult the institutions which are excluded from the lucrative practice of the audit who, naturally, will advise the Department that their members are perfectly capable of doing all that is required by the Bill. To take soundings among people in the various professional bodies will only confuse the Department unless there are widespread hearings and the Department is able to exercise substantial knowledge and judgment, which is probably not available and which the Secretary of State himself will not have.<br><br>
Parliament has a duty to look into ways in which the Executive is accumulating the power. It is here seeking to decide whether a man is capable of carrying out an audit. It is not a small matter. It raises an important issue concerning people's livelihood and the whole future of professional practice. I believe that auditing is changing rapidly at present because of internal professional pressures. There is all the hub-bub going on over inflation accounting. There is the thinking that has gone into the recommendations of the corporate report. Not all the recommendations of that report have been enthusiastically received by any means and a lively debate is going on. Criticism of auditors, expressed after recent company failures, has also given rise to a great deal of heart-searching about the way in which auditing ought
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 322</span>
to be carried out. But quite apart from these internal professional pressures, we are likely to see big changes in the next year or two as a result of the recommendations of the Bullock Committee. I hope, and believe, that we shall see a new element in top management whereby representatives of the employees are required to participate in and to comprehend the most serious decisions which companies have to take. These people, newly brought into management, will call for guidance from impartial professional advisers. That is one of the reasons why I tried to develop the idea of the audit committee as a statutory practice. The audit committee will be urgently needed by representatives of employees when they try to find their way through the facts and figures which are presented to boards and which will, inevitably, colour the way in which they act and vote.<br><br>
We also have a new development arising from our closer and growing association with Common Market countries where accountancy practice is sometimes quite different from ours. Very often theirs is less highly developed but sometimes it presents interesting challenges to the profession. Many firms have branches on the Continent, or are taking a serious interest in the way in which Continental audit procedures are carried out, so that they can give advice to their clients and also improve their own performance. There is also the likelihood that before too long we shall encounter pressure from the Commission for mutual recognition of accountancy qualifications. The Minister has not said anything about that. Another point concerns membership of the approved professional bodies, which may not be a guarantee of greater suitability to carry out the audit for companies of all kinds.<br><br>
I remember, when interviewing candidates for senior positions, and this was some years ago, one found that people who had practised through a professional qualification for some years in industry began to become restive because they found that the young men under them were asking questions that they could not answer. The qualifications which they had acquired had become obsolete. I think it is likely that a man who qualified under the examinations of one of the institutions listed here 20 years or 30 years ago may well be finding he is no longer able to keep
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0842">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 323</span>
abreast of the latest techniques, the most highly approved and up-to-date professional practices, unless he has been in constant practice.<br><br>
There are serious difficulties in trying to lay down in an Act of Parliament, backed up by departmental fiat, what is to happen in this area. The Committee has to remind itself that it is only since 1948 that the auditor has had to be qualified at all. This was an innovation in the Companies Act 1948. It is less than 30 years since it was necessary to be qualified and now we have before us this controversial clause. The Privy Council may not be the ideally suitable organ to which to appeal from the decision of the Department.<br><br>
11 a.m.<br><br>
This is a matter which obviously needs further study. The hon. Member has made a serious suggestion which ought to be considered. The Privy Council is an under-used organisation and contains many wise and experienced people who could be organised to study matters of this kind and who would be more impartial and experienced, perhaps, than the Secretary of State or his Departmental advisers.<br><br>
I am, therefore, disposed to support the hon. Member's amendment although I have certain misgivings on that point. Another way in which the Committee can approach this matter is to vote against the clause standing part of the Bill. This would give the Minister a further opportunity to think about it and to make further recommendations on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Loveridge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the most desirable thing would be if the Minister were to have second thoughts so that he could bring in a right of appeal. Not everyone is necessarily attracted by the idea that the Privy Council should be the relevant body, but, on the other hand, many of us feel that a right of appeal is important. The Secretary of State will be acting in his quasi-judicial capacity as a judge but he will be acting through his staff, advised by the monopoly group, as a jury as well. Iknow this happens on many other occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Iwould be grateful if the hon. Gentleman could help me in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 324</span>
this respect. It is necessary to consider what practical propositions can be advanced. First, the Minister will not act in a quasi-judicial capacity, he will act in a ministerial capacity. Therefore, what form of appeal could reasonably be brought to bear, having regard to the point that I made—that if it is the Privy Council or anybody in the position of the Privy Council dealing with a matter on which it has no expertise—it must necessarily go to the Secretary of State or the Department of Trade? Can the hon. Gentleman confer upon us the benefit of his expertise? Where does it get us?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Iknowof many occasions where courts have to decide on technical matters and have evidence brought before them. They may not be competent, but neither may the Secretary of State be competent, although the Minister says he would not be acting in a quasi-judicial capacity. I accept his strict definition of the words. Nevertheless, the effect on anyone who finds the decision against him is just the same as if the Minister were acting in judgment, whether it is an administrative decision or not. It is a play on words to try to determine between the two in this case.<br><br>
There are changes coming about in every professional sphere in the kingdom. There will be changes from Bullock, changes from mechanisation. Who can feel otherwise having heard what has been said in the Committee. There may be changes in definition of companies. There may be special companies for smaller businesses. Some lesser qualified body of accountants would be appropriate for those.<br><br>
The right of appeal is the most important thing that we can vote on if it comes to it. Even if the form of wording, as the Minister says, is difficult and not quite right, difficulties are made to be overcome and it is the Government's obligation to overcome these.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been an extremely interesting debate. I am glad that Ihave been instrumental in bringing it about because we are dealing with an extraordinarily important proposition—an appeal of some kind from Governmental decisions, namely those made by the Secretary of State taken on the advice ofpeople within his Department.<br><br>
I am always consumed with admiration for the skilled advocacy that my hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0843">Image</span>

Friend brings to bear in proposing any course of action which he supports, even when trying to defend the indefensible. I have noticed that the usual channels are open and are, perhaps, being heavily used in this operation. I hope my suspicions will prove wrong. I hope that I can carry with me these hon. Members who have expressed some slight doubts or reservations.<br><br>
The Minister said that this is an administrative decision. At present so it is. Administrative decisions are taken with the expert knowledge and advice of officers—to use my hon. Friend's words—and these officers are members of the recognised bodies. I do not intend to cast any doubts at all on their integrity but they cannot help being members of recognised bodies. In their minds and their feelings, their backgrounds, environment and experience, they cannot leave that fact behind when considering these matters.<br><br>
I should mention the analogy of the independence of local authorities. It is impossible to be a Conservative in national politics and an Independent in local politics. One is either a Conservative or is not. I remember a phenomenon called the Conservative and Independent Group on the Essex County Council which always seemed to be a dead giveaway.<br><br>
The position of recognition under Section 161 of the 1948 Companies Act is that non-recognition carries many more penalties than not being eligible to audit public companies. To most lay members of the public an accountant is a chartered accountant. They do not recognise that other persons may be qualified to carry out audits with the exception of the public company function.<br><br>
There is no direct precedent for Amendment No. 110. However, it is unique for a body to be completely and utterly excluded by virtue of legislation, particularly without any form of appeal. This brings me to some other suggestions which have been mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to approach this with an entirely open mind. The hon. Gentleman has raised important points. He said that it was unique for anyone to be excluded from a statute. I am not clear what research he has carried out. My impression is that that is not correct. Obviously I do not have the facts and figures at my finger-tips but I would have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 326</span>
thought that a number of bodies were so excluded.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should have inserted the words "proposed legislation". They have not been named previously but in this legislation they will be named.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not the hon. Gentleman's point. He is now changing his ground. He said that it was unique for statutes to exclude specific bodies. By that he must mean that they are not included amongst those who are authorised, yet many bodies are authorised to do one thing or another by statute. It is equally true to say that a large number of bodies which would like to be authorised are not included in the statute. if we exclude a particular group by this process it is a unique situation. I think that there are a number of situations like this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I bow to the hon. Gentleman's great depth of experience in these matters. Accountancy is not a registered profession as such. Other professions, where there are appeals, are registered professions and therefore their governing bodies, by virtue of being registered and created under statute, have virtually the force of law behind them. That is why they can appeal to the Privy Council. In Section 14 of the Opticians Act 1958 the side-note refers to appeals in disciplinary and other cases. Section 14(1) reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"At any time within twenty-eight days from the service of a notification that the Disciplinary Committee have under section eleven or section thirteen of this Act directed that the name of an individual or a body corporate be erased from the register or list or that a body corporate shall not use any of the titles specified in subsection (6) of the said section eleven in connection with a set of premises, that individual or body corporate may, in accordance with such rules as Her Majesty in Council may by Order provide for the purposes of this section, appeal to Her Majesty in Council."</p></blockquote>
That seems to provide a reasonable reference. A body corporate has a right of appeal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that context the body corporate is in exactly the same position as the individual. In certain professions or semi-professional capacities, limited companies are permitted to operate, as distinct from firms of solicitors or accountants which can only operate either as individuals or as a firm.<br><br>
What my hon. Friend is missing is the question of authority to operate at all as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0844">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 327</span>
a body. This is the point—whether it should be recognised and whether there should be authority to practice as a profession—to which my hon. Friend should direct his attention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged. I had in mind that if we were not terribly successful in the course of the proceedings, we might need to have an Act for the unification and regulation of the accounting profession. That might help us on.<br><br>
The Privy Council is the Executive as opposed to the Legislature. That is why we believe the Privy Council is the appropriate body for such a task. It is not possible for the High Court to give a decision in these cases. I cannot see how it is possible for an individual to make representations on behalf of the body or association of which he is a member. Presumably every member of that association has to make an appeal to make some sort of case. No other body is appropriate except the Privy Council.<br><br>
My hon. Friend introduced the phrase "the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council". I cannot see why it is necessary for this matter to be restricted to the Judicial Committee. The Privy Council is a body with very wide powers and if such an appeal were referred to the Privy Council I can see no reason why it could not set up an independent panel of assessors, consisting of accounting authorities from throughout the professions and throughout the departments of universities and so on, to advise it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is there no precedent for an appeal to the Privy Council as against the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot think of one, except that the statute refers to the "Queen in Council" which may or may not include the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. We are dealing with an unprecedented situation. It is the duty of Parliament to deal with a changing situation and to create the conditions necessary to help people to cope with them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shersby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman care to differentiate between those members of a professional body who are recognised by the Secretary of State and authorised by him to carry out audits, and the absence, for the time being, of recog-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 328</span>
nition of a professional body which,if granted,would automatically grant authorisation to the individual members? This is a matter which we have been Debating at some length. There is, there-fore, this question of the individual as opposed to the professional body.</span></p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The individual member is able to practise because he has passed the examination of the governing body of his profession, because he has established that he has good standing and because he has gained practising ability. In the case of one body of which I have knowledge an individual must do 30 months in practice after the examination before he can set up in business on his own. It is impossible for individuals to make appeals because the individual exists in practice only by virtue of the authorisation of his governing body. Therefore, the important element is the governing body, which the Minister either recognises or does not recognise.<br><br>
Section 13 of the Medical Act 1956 deals with the qualifications of individuals and, if the General Medical Council is not satisfied with the course provided at a university, the GMC has the power to make reference to the Privy Council which can then determine whether the course provides a registerable qualification. That would not be dealt with by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to keep intervening but I want to be clear about the situation. The hon. Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Ford) is not arguing that medical qualifications are determined by the trade body in this context but he is saying that the appeal is to the Privy Council. I hope that the Minister will reply to the specific point involving the position of medical bodies with an appeal to the Privy Council as opposed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. That needs to be considered and it applies both to bodies and individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is my understanding of Section 13 of the Medical Act. We are dealing with a new departure in company legislation—namely that certain bodies are, for the first time, to be named in statute as auditors of public companies. I am interested in that principle because for many years I thought that the old Board of Trade was a large and rambling depart-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0845">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 329</span>
ment, in many cells of which it was possible for people to make decisions against which there was no appeal. That caused frustration and injustice among many people.<br><br>
I am not engaging in special pleading although, I admit, any course of action is sparked off by knowledge of an area in which frustration or injustice is felt. I am not suggesting that the Minister has been particularly dilatory in considering current applications nor am I suggesting that injustice will be perpetrated voluntarily. It may be perpetrated involuntarily. Therefore. I hope that by quoting some of the precedents and by suggesting that we have a completely new situation demanding new solutions, I shall carry some of my hon. Friends and some hon. Members opposite with me when I divide the Committee on the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try succinctly to answer some of the points which have been raised, but I hope that I shall do justice to the arguments. The hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) raised the specific matter of whether the reasons for refusal might be more widely publicised. Successive Governments have regarded applications of that kind as being matters between the applicant and the Department of Trade. There has been no previous pressure for reasons to be disclosed. If there was shown to be a public interest we could consider giving a public explanation of the decision but the Committee should recognise that that might not be acceptable to the applicant because it might be unflattering to the applicant if the reasons were disclosed.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Worthing sought elucidation on a matter with which my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Ford) failed to deal. The hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Shersby) raised the question of planning applications, and I sought to deal with that in my intervention which I hope was to his satisfaction. The hon. Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) asked how one could curtail the administrative powers of Ministers. He thought that they were too wide and that there should be an effective way of ensuring that they did not abuse those powers. But, Parliament has already done that. Parliament has rightly provided for the establishment of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration who is there precisely to look at
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 330</span>
cases of maladministration. From time to time he has identified such cases and has made some important reflections on the powers exercised by Ministers in both Conservative and Labour Governments. One of the significant dangers of embarking upon a process of appeal which, in my submission will not be workable, is that one may remove the power of the Parliamentary Commissioner to deal effectively with cases of maladministration. My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, North failed to allude to that in his concluding remarks. I submit that one cannot dissociate in this procedure the position of the Privy Council, and whatever body it is dealing with, and appeals against administrative decisions of Ministers from the Department because the Department will be called upon to provide that expertise which is not available to the Privy Council or the body with which it is dealing.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Worthing raised a significant point. These are administrative decisions and one is able to discusss them, to question Ministers about them, to raise them in the House in debate and Question Time apart from being able to raise the matter with the Parliamentary Commissioner via a Member of Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While in my view the Privy Council can seek evidence from the Department in question, if it took the course that I am suggesting and set up an independent assessment panel, it would not have to rely upon that Department for its expertise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to distinguish in an issue of this kind, where it is not simply a question of evidence but one of expertise. t is impracticable to approach the matter in that way. My hon. Friend said that it is unique for a body to be excluded by statute—a point that was substantially dealt with by the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) in a pretty good piece of cross-examination which was worthy of Marshall Hall. My hon. Friend argued that if one had some new profession which is not yet recognised by statute one could find that that body had failed to provide any satisfactory examination procedure or syllabus and, on the basis of that argument, my hon. Friend would say that they should not be excluded.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In due course we shall have to recognise a qualification for a professional director.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0846">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 331</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not go into that now, otherwise we would have an interminable Committee stage.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, North raised the question of the Opticians Act. That is irrelevant. He specifically referred to Section 14 which deals with disciplinary proceedings. The <i>regimen</i> relating to discipline must follow the question of determining the authority of a body to operate as a profession, and not the other way round. The mere fact that it refers to a body corporate is not relevant. My hon. Friend asked: why bother with the judicial Committee of the Privy Council instead of the Privy Council as such?" He spoke of the General Medical Council where the appeal lies to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and not the Privy Council as a whole. If we are to consider the matter at all we must recognise that it would be the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council which would be the determining factor in these matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister say how the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council determines whether a course is a register-able qualification?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: t is not for me to answer that question. It goes to the heart of what my hon. Friend is arguing and if he is not able to answer that question the veracity of his argument is destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the crucial question whether a particular matter is justiciable or not? The hon. Member for Bradford, North is arguing that if it is justiciable in the case of medical qualifications it is justiciable in other cases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not yet got to that point. I am saying that in the specific case with which we are dealing, it is not justiciable because it is an administrative decision. But, in the case of the General Medical Council, if we recognise BAAA, for example, or, as we have already recognised, a number of accountancy bodies, and it is considered by an individual that the syllabus offered by that body is not appropriate, the individual might in those circumstances have a right of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. I am not satisfied that my hon. Friend has established the case about the General Medical Council. I must look at that further. It is right that I should do
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 332</span>
so, although I do not believe that this point is on all fours with the main issue.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
This is the value of the debate. It has enabled the officials in the Department to advise the Secretary of State that any abuse of his powers is a matter about which Parliament will be vigilant. I do not think that one tittle of evidence was produced during this debate to suggest that there had been any abuse of his power. That is germane to the consideration of this principle. If there had been cases where it was thought that the Secretary of State had been improperly advised and unfair in his consideration of this matter, we should be even more concerned about the situation than the Committee has already indicated. When I say "Secretary of State" I mean not only the present holder of this office but successive Secretaries of State for Trade and Presidents of the Board of Trade.<br><br>
I have noted what my hon. Friend said. I shall carefully consider the point about the General Medical Council, although it is not on all fours with the case which we are considering. I ask the Committee to reject this proposal on the grounds that it is both unworkable and irrelevant to the considerations that must be applied in these cases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a considerable investigation into the matters raised by the hon. Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Ford). We have listened carefully and impartially to the arguments put forward. I had no set views in advance, on this issue. Therefore I find it difficult to make a decision at this stage.<br><br>
The Opposition are second to none in their desire to maintain and raise the standard of accountancy bodies. That is not in dispute between either side of the Committee. The crucial question is whether those who feel that their institute or association reaches the required standard, but who are now turned down by the Secretary of State, should have the right of appeal. That raises a number of difficult questions—not least whether the Privy Council is the appropriate body. The hon. Gentleman had some problems in deciding whether the body should be the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council or the Privy Council itself.<br><br>
Despite the Minister having put forward his view, on advice from officials, it is far
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0847">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 333</span>
from clear precisely what is the position in a number of individual cases. I do not think that the question of the General Medical Council has been entirely cleared up. It might be possible to distinguish that case from this. There are a great many other cases of professional qualifications which would need to be investigated. I should be reluctant at this stage to give this body a special privilege—because privilege it is—which, as far as we may establish, does not extend to others.<br><br>
There may be a number of anomalies on this matter which exist now. The whole issue should be reviewed. I find myself in considerable sympathy with that. The trouble is that if we go ahead and legislate on it now we might create a great many additional anomalies which might be even more objectionable.<br><br>
The General Medical Council point is crucial. It applies to a series of other similar cases. The Minister said that he would look at the matter between now and Report. Therefore the right course of action is not to take a decision on this matter now but to look at it again on Report.<br><br>
All of us need to do more homework on this matter than we have been able to do since the last sitting. I cannot advise my hon. Friends to support an amendment which carries the dangers which I mentioned. The right course is not to reach a decision now. I hope that the Minister will look at this matter between now and Report with as open a mind as I have endeavoured to address to it. This is obviously a matter for consideration.<br><br>
I do not doubt that if a satisfactory solution is not reached this morning the hon. Gentleman will wish to return to it on Report. I should think that it would be an appropriate subject for selection at that point. A number of us are experiencing problems in reaching a firm decision as a result of the lack of data on an enormous range of subjects affecting virtually every profession in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr.Shersby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been an extremely interesting and valuable debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) has put his finger on the problem facing the Committee. This is a difficult matter to decide in the light of the information which came before us this morning. Therefore it is vital to study the matter in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 334</span>
considerable detail. I add my voice to that of my hon. Friend in hoping that the hon. Member for Bradford, North will withdraw the amendment and give us an opportunity to reconsider it before Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cecil Parkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was a little reluctant to intervene as I have an interest to declare. I am a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants.<br><br>
One of the great problems of the accountancy profession since the 1948 Act has been the great profusion of accountancy qualifications. People may call themselves accountants if they send a 5p stamp to a gentleman who resides in an obscure corner of the country. Other people have had to serve articles for five years without pay in a professional accountant's office.<br><br>
The profession is trying to establish standards of qualifications and professional conduct. It has been working hard to try to reach agreement. The Institute of Chartered Accountants has absorbed one or two bodies. There is a move in the profession to get together and to try to bring the Institute of Costs and Works Accountants together and to form an accountancy profession. That is the right way to proceed.<br><br>
Being able to sign the word "accountant" at the bottom of a balance sheet may be misleading to the uninitiated. He may think that he is dealing with someone who is well qualified and who has been through the qualification procedure, and that he may therefore trust such work. I know that safeguards are built into this Bill. Anything which encourages people to set up a new accountancy qualifications body would be a move in the wrong direction. I do not believe in creating monopolies. I believe that there should be an accountancy profession, the members of which have accepted rules and regulations, which works to certain standards and which provides a training so that people may qualify. That is the direction in which the profession is moving. If we ended up with one professional qualification we should not have created a monopoly, as there would still be accountants in small towns and big cities. There are about 150,000 accountants. A person would not need to go to one accountant. He would have a great choice at his disposal. But he would know that they all had uniform qualifi-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0848">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 335</span>
cations, had been through a certain amount of training and served a specified time with the profession before they could use that qualification.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do I understand that the hon. Gentleman would broadly approve a proposal for the unification, registration and regulation of the accountancy profession?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I feel that that is not a question that needs answering, as the move is all in that direction. The question keeps coming up, the profession bucks it a little and we then move a little further forward towards reaching agreement. Agreement will be reached. In the years ahead the accountancy profession will become closer. At present there are many problems. People may serve on a part-time basis while doing another job, and obtain a qualification as one kind of accountant. Other people who have served their articles for five years do not find it easy to accept that they should get together overnight and should both be entitled to use the same qualification. However, the move is in that direction. A forced imposition of registration would be wrong. I have a great deal of sympathy for the intention behind the hon. Gentleman's amendment, but it would be going against the tide which is running in the profession and which should be encouraged, not discouraged.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support what has just been said. The hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) is right in one particular. I must give consideration to one of the points raised by my hon. Friend, although I do not believe that it is on all fours with the case that we are considering. However, I join with the hon. Gentleman in suggesting that it would be appropriate, in view of the weight of argument and fact, which tend the other way, for my hon. Friend to withdraw his amendment at this stage so that we may give it reconsideration on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the Committee stage. I sympathise with the dilemma of the hon. Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Ford). He has been asked by the Minister to withdraw the amendment. I do not think that he should do so. The Committee is united in feeling
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 336</span>
that this matter needs further study. We are now coming towards the end of July. The Minister is anxious to hasten the conclusion of the consideration of this Bill. If the Bill goes forward with this amendment in it, unsatisfactory though it may be, the hon. Gentleman will have secured his object of ensuring that this matter has further consideration. If we reject the amendment or if the hon. Gentleman is persuaded to withdraw it, the matter may be lost. As I do not think that the Minister gave us a concrete assurance that a new clause would be introduced on Report I think that we should support the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of many of the observations made, and of the fact that I shall not carry the Committee with me in any case, I am disposed to withdraw the amendment. I say to the Minister that I went through all this in 1967. One of his distinguished predecessors gave me an exactly similar promise, which he failed to fulfil.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not promising anything.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend promised to consider the matter. On condition that my hon. Friend gives a fully reasoned reply on this matter on Report I am prepared to withdraw the amendment. However, if we do not receive a fair reply and hearing, I promise him a lot of trouble in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must make it plain, so that my hon. Friend is under no illusion about the situation, that I am not with him on the principle that he has produced for consideration by the Committee. I agreed to consider the single point that was raised by my hon. Friend. I do not want him to be under any misapprehension about the terms upon which he is proposing to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend made his position clear on the principle. Therefore on principle I shall not withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly we have dealt with a number of points on this clause. I assumed that as there was a tie on the last amendment this is a matter which the House will wish to return to on Report.<br><br>
I have two points to raise at this stage. The first is on subsection (3) which on re-reading it I find is ambiguous. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) drew this to my attention. The subsection is concerned with qualifications which people may have acquired abroad. It does not say that if their qualifications are adequate people will be allowed to practice in this country, but that people with qualifications acquired abroad will be allowed to practice in this country if the other country allows our qualified people to practice there.<br><br>
That seems a rather nineteenth century reciprocal arrangement, because, as I understand it, the implication would be that anyone with a foreign qualification, would, however ill-qualified and badly examined they may be, be able to practice in this country so long as for example a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants was allowed to practice in the other country. That seems to be a very odd side effect. Reciprocity is all that is necessary to allow anyone to practice in this country. If that is indeed possible it is something that we ought to consider very carefully.<br><br>
Clause 13(5) is concerned with someone who is disqualified. It says that no one should act as auditor of a company at a time when he knows he is disqualified for that appointment. It does not say "not qualified". It says "disqualified". I can see that it would be wrong for someone who did not have a qualification to set himself up and seek to act as an auditor, but what
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 338</span>
I am not clear about is how anyone becomes disqualified as against unqualified and whether it is proposed that there should be a register, for example, of disqualified auditors in the same way as the Government are proposing that there should be a register of disqualified directors.<br><br>
I am not clear how someone who is qualified gets himself disqualified. Is it simply by the professional body of which he is a member, or is it something which stems from the Government's powers? It is important that we should be clear what the position is because we have had a number of reports recently by inspectors on certain companies which have heavily criticised the auditors. I am not at all clear whether there is some machinery by which they could be disqualified as against action being taken by the body which has been authorised, for example, under the earlier parts of this clause.<br><br>
Those are the only two points I have at this stage. Iam anxious to make progress but I think that they are points which need to be clarified.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (3) permits the Secretary of State to refuse authorisation to British accountants who are not given reciprocal treatment in another country. It does not require the Secretary of State to give authorisation to an overseas accountant who has inadequate qualifications. I hope that that point is clarified.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It does not quite clarify it. The hon. Gentleman is saying that it enables the Secretary of State to refuse authorisation to a British person having qualifications acquired outside the United Kingdom. Icannot see any reference there to the nationality of the person involved. As I understand it, it is broader than that. It applies to anyone who obtains qualifications outside the United Kingdom if the country concerned gives reciprocal benefits to our people practising there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Perhaps it would be helpful if Igo over subsection (3) which makes it clear the Secretary of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0850">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 339</span>
State has the right to demand reciprocity of treatment for accountants trained in the United Kingdom from an overseas Government before authorising, under Section 116(1)(b) persons who obtained their qualifications outside the United Kingdom. It does not permit him to withdraw authorisation from overseas-trained accountants purely by way of retaliation and it does not follow from this subsection that the Secretary of State is required to authorise an overseas accountant to practice here who has inadequate qualifications. There is nothing in the subsection to suggest that at all.<br><br>
I return now to subsection (5) and the question of disqualification. It does not mean "qualified" in this context. Disqualification can result from a man's dismissal from his professional organisation or he can withdraw from the accountancy body. There may be withdrawal of an individual authorisation which the Secretary of State has power to give and which is part of the consideration of Clause 13. There is no machinery here for disqualification by the courts or the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is always difficult when one asks a question and it is not satisfactorily answered, to do other than repeat the question. If I rephrase it, it may be that the point will be clearer to the Under-Secretary.<br><br>
In Clause 13(3) we are told the Secretary of State may refuse authorisation under paragraph (<i>b</i>) to a person—as I understand it—of whatever nationality having qualifications obtained outside the United Kingdom:
<br><blockquote><p>"if it appears to him that the country in which the qualifications were obtained does not confer on persons qualified in the United Kingdom privileges corresponding".</p></blockquote>
It is a true reciprocity basis—if the Secretary of State feels like it he can refuse to authorise a person qualified in that country if that country does not allow people qualified in this country to practice there.<br><br>
If that is all the subsection says—and it may be the matter is taken up elsewhere, but if so I have not discovered it—what is the position of someone who had qualified in country X and who wishes to practise here? Can he automatically practise as an auditor or does something else have to be done? If he is qualified in country X but if country X does not give reciprocal priv-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 340</span>
leges in their country for people here who are qualified, is it the case that the Secretary of State—however well qualified the person may be in country X—may refuse an authorisation on the grounds that there have not been reciprocal privileges given? If not I fail to understand what it means. I hope that rephrases the question and I hope that perhaps the Secretary of State will have a shot at rephrasing his answer.<br><br>
There are two problems under subsection (5) which now emerge. One is that it is true that the Secretary of State could withdraw approval of someone he had approved. The point I am a little concerned about is the fact that, on the one hand the professional body concerned can withdraw someone's qualification—and that may be entirely justifiable. But supposing someone clearly ought to be a disqualified individual as a result of the way he has audited some accounts. Is there any machinery by which the Government can disqualify him although the professional body may see fit to keep him on the books? I am not sure whether the Secretary of State has any power to do that but it seems extremely relevant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may deal with the second point first, this situation arises not only in cases of this kind affecting auditors but also in cases affecting actuaries, where the Secretary of State is very much involved with the standards of professional expertise that an actuary provides but has no power to say that an actuary should be disciplined by his professional body. If the Secretary of State believes that an actuary is not performing his duties or is performing them unprofessionally, at its highest he can refer the matter to the Institute of Actuaries. Similarly, if the Secretary of State has evidence to suggest that a solicitor with whom he, or anyone else, is dealing is behaving unprofessionally he can refer him to his professional body. The same must apply to accountants. I think I have dealt with that specific matter.<br><br>
The question whether somebody ought to be disqualified must I think, quintessentially be a matter for the professional body. After all, it is his whole future that is at stake and he is entitled to assume that matters which will be crucial to his future and which are being discussed in the context of an allegation of unprofessional action on his part, will be given proper attention by the disciplinary body of that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0851">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 341</span>
organisation. That is the right way to look at the position. With the power of the Secretary of State to authorise under Section 161 a different consideration arises. Once someone is disqualified from acting as an accountant he has to be disqualified for this purpose too. I think that deals with the second point.<br><br>
I come back to the question of reciprocity and so on. There is no automatic authorisation for an overseas accountant coming from a country which provides reciprocal privileges. The qualification of that individual has to be adequate and has to satisfy the criteria laid down in the United Kingdom. I hope that has satisfactorily dealt with the points raised and that we will be able to move on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The individual concerned has to be individually authorised by the Secretary of State? Is that the position?</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
APPOINTMENT OF AUDITORS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 49, in page 18, line 9, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(4) Where an auditor intimates at an Annual General Meeting or after notice of that meeting has been issued, that he does not wish to be reappointed, or a resolution to reappoint a retiring auditor is defeated at the Annual General Meeting, such a vacancy shall be treated as a casual vacancy in the office of auditor and the directors of the company shall be empowered to appoint an interim auditor for the period up to the next general meeting".</p></blockquote>
This amendment deals with the situation concerning the resignation of auditors. It is really a probing amendment to explore the situation which arises if an auditor intimates at an annual general meeting or after the notice of that meeting has been sent to press, that he does not wish to be re-appointed. For that matter the same question arises if a resolution to re-appoint a resigning auditor is defeated at an annual general meeting. Looking at the Bill one would presume that that created a situation
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 342</span>
where the office of auditor was treated as a casual vacancy although it does seem a little odd that a casual vacancy could apply to a situation that has arisen at the annual general meeting. The amendment tries to clarify and confirm that the situation should be treated on a casual basis. If the Government have some other procedure in mind that would cover this eventuality as effectively I would listen with interest. I believe that this situation should be catered for because, after all, it is a quite probable situation. I do not think there ought to be a situation of doubt. Certainly, that doubt, where used perhaps not to appoint an auditor, could frustrate not only the wishes of the company but also the interests of the public. I should be grateful if the Minister could give some clarification of the Government's intention on this clause.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest to the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley), who said that this was a probing amendment. Nonetheless, I am drawn to the conclusion that some of my hon. Friends are having to lend their support and aid to the Government in dealing with amendments brought from other quarters.<br><br>
I have considered Amendment No. 49 with great interest, and I wanted to hear what the hon. Member for Caernarvon said in moving it before advising my hon. Friends how we should vote on it. Philosophically it is apparent to us that boards of directors should have the right to fill a casual vacancy because of the circumstances which the hon. Member for Caernarvon has mentioned rather than that this right should subsist, as it does at present, with the Secretary of State for Trade. Philosophically we would much prefer to see it that way. I suggest to the hon. Member for Caernarvon that if he thinks through his arguments a little further he may have second thoughts about the amendment.<br><br>
Section 159(3) of the Companies Act 1948 provides:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where at an annual general meeting no auditors are appointed or reappointed, the Board of Trade may appoint a person to fill the vacancy."</p></blockquote>
Presumably that right for the Secretary of State will continue after the Com-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0852">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 343</span>
panies (No. 2) Bill becomes law, if, indeed, if ever does become law. It is worth while standing back for a moment and thinking whether this right is important. Here one must go to the reasons why an auditor might resign after notice of an annual general meeting has already been issued. If the notice had already gone out, sufficient time would not be available to the board to call an extraordinary general meeting at which new auditors could be appointed. That is quite simply because an extraordinary general meeting requires 28 days' notice and an annual general meeting requires only 21 days' notice. Therefore, in these circumstances, a board of directors could be 'very irritated and find it extremely inconvenient that its auditor had resigned after the notice of the annual general meeting had already gone out.<br><br>
Why, therefore, should an auditor do this? He would presumably have some special reasons to resign at this inconvenient moment. It could be that he was a partner in a relatively small firm who had decided to resign because of illness or age but there was no one within the firm to carry on his duties. But it is equally likely that he was resigning after the notice of the annual general meeting had gone out because he wished to cause some embarrassment to the company, perhaps because he had a quarrel with the board of directors or because he saw a trend in the company accounts that he did not like. t could be that the directors had brought pressure on him in relation to the accounts and therefore he wanted to get into a situation in which the directors could not just accept his resignation and refill the position as a casual vacancy with a weaker auditor or with someone who might issue unqualified accounts when he had insisted on issuing qualified accounts.<br><br>
Therefore, in giving the auditor this power to resign at this particular time after the notice of the annual general meeting had gone out and the board of directors could not just refill the casual vacancy but had to turn to the Department of Trade, we are putting a particularly strong card in his hands which he may wish to use on occasion.<br><br>
The same argument applies to the even more dramatic situation when an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 344</span>
auditor who is up for reappointment is defeated at the annual general meeting. This defeat, of course, could be engineered by the directors. They could arrange for their proxies to be so used that whilst, on the surface, everything was calm and quiet and the existing firm of auditors was up for reappointment, none the less, their proxies were advised, or requested, to vote against the reappointment of that auditor. This would be done quite calmly and quietly. There would be no public fuss, but the results would be just the same as the situation I have already outlined. The directors might have decided that here was a firm of auditors which was very difficult and which had caused them a great deal of trouble over the past year and they did not want them reappointed but wanted a casual vacancy to be created. Under the amendment which the hon. Member for Caernarvon has suggested, they would have the right to fill the vacancy and reappoint a new auditor and they would have 12 months within which to soften up the auditor before his reappointment had to be confirmed at the following annual general meeting.<br><br>
The amendment has to be read in conjunction with the other clauses. In Clause 14 and Clause 15 a resigning auditor is given particular powers to summon an extraordinary general meeting of the company. But, in the light of those subsequent provisions in this clause, I think it would be a mistake to accept this amendment and perhaps, on reflection, the hon. Member for Caernarvon will withdraw it.<br><br>
We are looking to the auditors to take unto themselves new powers and a wider range of responsibilities. Certainly, in leading boards of directors through the mysteries of inflation accounting by telling directors how to tackle inflation accounting, and in discussing the Crawford Report and the Government consultative paper "The Aim and Scope of Company Accounts," auditors will find themselves in a more intimate and fuller relationship with directors than has been the case in past years. In these circumstances, they will need all the cards in their hands that they have got. I believe that if they are not reappointed at an annual general meeting, or if they resign after the notice of the annual general meeting has gone out and there is no
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0853">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 345</span>
time for the company to suggest and, in the normal way, appoint a new auditor, then this is a strong card in the auditor's hand which he may wish to play at times.<br><br>
There is only one question of definition that I should like the Minister to answer. Section 159(3) of the 1948 Act reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Board of Trade may appoint a person to fill the vacancy."</p></blockquote>
I wonder whether the Minister would clarify the word "may". Is this a discretionary power? As far as I know, these powers have been rarely used, but is it normally taken to mean that the Board of Trade shall appoint a person to fill the vacancy? Some reference to the practice: of past years would, I believe, be helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The. Parliamentary Secretary to the Law Officers' Department (Mr. Arthur Davidson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) said this was a probing amendment, and the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) said he was coming to the aid of presumably myself by effectively explaining why the amendment, probing or otherwise, would be highly undesirable. I am happy to say that he has left me with very little to say.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Mid-Sussex is absolutely right in that Section 159(3) of the 1948 Act provides that the Board of Trade—in effect, that now means the Secretary of State—may appoint an auditor if none has been appointed at the annual general meeting. This power is very rarely used. I am told that the cases average about one a year.<br><br>
With regard to the point about "may" or "shall," the word "may" is taken to mean " shall". It may well be that cases will become a little more common. New arrangements under this Bill ceases the practice of existing auditors continuing in office without a positive resolution from the company in general meeting. Nevertheless, I am sure the hon. Member for Caernarvon would agree that it would be undesirable, for the reasons that the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex has already mentioned, for directors to have the power to fill such a vacancy and that, in these circumstances, the intervention of the Secretary of State is a useful safeguard. Were the directors to be free to fill the vacancy, they could appoint the very
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 346</span>
person whom the shareholders had rejected at the annual general meeting. Even in cases in which the auditor had voluntarily stood down it could be dangerous to give the directors powers to fill the vacancies. They could well be acting in collusion with the auditor so as to give the directors a free hand in appointing his successor.<br><br>
I hope that, in these circumstances, the hon. Member for Caernarvon will feel that it is necessary for the Secretary of State to have this power. I should be happy to deal with any other points which may be raised.<br><br>
Section 159(6) provides that:
<br><blockquote><p>"The directors may fill any casual vacancy of auditor."</p></blockquote>
The clause we are now discussing provides that the company in general, in addition to the directors, may fill such a vacancy. That is an additional safeguard.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wigley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the comments of members of Conservative Front Bench and of the Government with regard to the amendment. Obviously I take note of what has been said. I believe some pertinent points have been made. I would return to the situation of the 1948 Act and the fact that only one case a year has been raised in the past. I imagine that they may be much more frequent following the passing of this Bill. They are necessary provisions which I welcome, but I hope that the Department will be in a position to deal with what could be a considerable upsurge in the number of cases. Obviously the voting out of auditors could happen on a number of occasions. There may also be those who resign within this period, particularly after the comments we have heard a moment ago, and they could seize on this as a way of broadcasting their doubts or unhappiness about the situation, in which case the Department may find itself facing a number of cases in which it has to involve itself.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
I do not like very much drawing in the Department unnecessarily to cases such as these. We will be using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. The Department could get involved in some cases that might be quite trivial. It would be regrettable if this was the case. The Department has more important work to get on with.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 347</span>
I accept that there is a balance that dictates that in some circumstances it would be unfortunate to put the power back into the hands of the directors if the circumstances which led to the voting-out of the auditors were such that the powers would be misused.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have serious reservations about this clause. One of the problems is that very few people who own shares in companies understand the role of the auditor. The auditor is appointed. by the shareholders and he reports to them on what the directors have done with the assets of the company in the period in question. He certifies that the report which the directors are obliged to produce gives the shareholders a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs. The auditor is very much the shareholders' man. It is his job to report to them.<br><br>
Under the present arrangements the auditor does this in a most unsatisfactory way. Very few of the shareholders understand who the auditor is or what his connection is with them. The only contact they have with the auditor is once a year. Those who go to the annual general meeting will sec a rather strange figure—or perhaps I should say a perfectly normal figure, because accountants tend to be very ordinary, normal, sensible people. To those present who are accountants I say "If the cap fits wear it." The shareholders see a man whom none of them has ever set eyes on before. The chairman says "I call upon the auditor to read his report". There is a new game among auditors—to make the report as short as possible while still conforming to the Companies Act. A gentleman whom none has seen before stands up and reads the minimum number of words saying "I certify that I have examined the books. They give a true and fair view. The balance sheet is all right." He sits down, the moment has passed, and the poor old shareholder has had the report from his auditor.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 348</span>
Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) will agree with me that the position of the auditor needs strengthening as does the link between the shareholder and the auditor. The report should not be a formal sentence read at a brief interlude at the annual general meeting. It is the only physical contact which the shareholder has with the auditor.<br><br>
It might be asked what that has to do with Clause 14. Clause 14, extraordinarily enough, weakens the position of the auditor in some ways rather than strengthening it. The audit should be built up and the links between the shareholder and the auditor should be strengthened. I am not arguing that the position of the auditor is being undermined. We are saying that the auditor's position will not be strengthened at all in some ways. The one strength that the auditor had was that it required a fairly major effort to get rid of him. That is slightly weakened by this clause.<br><br>
There are all sorts of things that ought to be done to the position of the auditor. I hope that the Government, when considering this major legislation, will bear this very much in mind. I hope that they will realise that many of the activities and events in company matters which have caused controversy in recent years could have been avoided if the auditor had had to give a more full report and had had the links between him and the shareholders strengthened.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening to my hon. Friend with care. I would not have thought that the cap that he described auditors and accountants as wearing fitted him. From his deep knowledge of the business I wonder whether he would care to tell us in detail in what respect he thinks that Section 14 of the Bill weakens the position of the auditor. We all agree that we want his position strengthened. Clause 14 must be read with Clause 15 and Clause 16.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly deal with that point in a moment. If we have to make changes in the position of auditors, and there are changes which need to be made, this particular change is probably least important and the last one that I would have bothered to make.<br><br>
It is not a serious weakening of the auditor's position. We have to strengthen the position of the auditors. Far too many auditors do not have to tell the share-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0855">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 349</span>
holders enough. There is not enough call for disclosure. They work far too closely with the directors whom they are supposed to be reporting on rather than with the shareholders to whom they are supposed to be reporting and for whom they work. I do not think that to say that from now on the only change that we will make in the position of auditors is that they have to be re-appointed every year, will strengthen them. The one strength that they have at present is that they are there. If they take a firm line a major effort is necessary to shunt them out. They are re-appointed automatically unless the directors make a major effort to get rid of them. If the directors do get rid of them the auditors have their right to come back. The fact that they can continue in office and the directors have to make a major effort to get rid of them is a slight strengthening of their position. t is not the sort of strength that they need. They need strengthening considerably.<br><br>
I hope that the Government, when they come to draw up a proper Companies Bill—not this little apology for a Companies Bill—will bear very much in mind the need to build up the position of the auditor and the need to strengthen the links between the auditor and the shareholders for whom he works and tc whom he is answerable. Far too many auditors have forgotten that, and regard themselves as working for the directors and answerable to them. They are answerable to the shareholders about the activities of the directors. I hope that the legislation when framed will resolve that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening with great interest to my hon. Friend's comments on Clause 14. In many ways this short Subsection (1) of Clause 14 contains one of the very few important things in this Bill. It repeals Section 159(2) of the 1948 Act, which means that auditors will not be re-appointed automatically as they now are in almost every circumstance. They will have to come up for positive re-election by the shareholders every year. This is one of the few things that stands cut in this Bill.<br><br>
My hon. Friend has said that he felt that of all the changes that were needed in the requirements upon auditors, in the tasks being laid on their shoulders and in their responsibilities and work with shareholders this was one of the least important. For that reason he had his reservations
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 350</span>
about this clause. The sad thing is that that comment could apply to the whole Bill. So much in the Bill is relatively unimportant compared with the other changes which we would like to see in company law.<br><br>
For example, legislation on securities is notably absent from the Bill as is legislation on the overall responsibility of directors. Wider provision about the role of auditors is notably absent. In all these cases we are told to wait for Bullock. In waiting for Bullock we seem to be waiting for a sacred cow to be slaughtered. Sacred cows have long lives. I hope we do not have to wait so long for the recommendations of Bullock to come forward.<br><br>
On balance the minor changes in Clause 14 will be an improvement. My hon. Friend made an interesting and somewhat philosophical point whether being auditors having to be elected every year with shareholders voting for them meant much of a difference from being appointed without the matter put to the shareholders. Marginally it will make little difference. But what my hon. Friend said leads back to comments made by the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) and supported by my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) and myself in an earlier meeting of this Committee when we talked about the role of audit committees in the future and of putting auditors in the same relationship with, for example, non-executive directors so that these two can work together, reporting to shareholders as a vehicle of supervision over executive management.<br><br>
This sort of growing role for the auditors, looking backwards at what has happened financially and the management of the past, not looking forward—auditors are not capable of looking forward in this area—is a new responsibility that should be developed for auditors. I do not intend to rehash those arguments, but they are relevant to what my hon. Friend said. I hope that future company legislation along those lines we will see Government thinking develop.<br><br>
Earlier we had a useful discussion about the relationship of directors and auditors. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, South (Mr. Parkinson) reminded the Committee that the auditor is the shareholders' man. This cannot be said too often. The auditor is appointed by the directors. t is most important that those appointed when there is a casual vacancy
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0856">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 351</span>
should be confirmed and re-confirmed by the shareholders. They should bear in mind that the auditor is there to report to them on the proper financial management of the company. The more that this responsibility of the auditors can be brought into the open, so that the shareholders do not think that he is some <i>eminence grin,</i>put there by the directors to conceal things, the more the auditors' responsibility to the shareholders can be brought into the open, the more satisfactory conduct we shall see on the part of limited liability companies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, South (Mr. Parkinson) has put forward something which most of us agree with in our hearts. The auditors should be strengthened in relation to their responsibilities, particularly the responsibility of explaining the accounts to the shareholders. I should have thought that in practice, Clause 14, far from weakening the auditors' position, as my hon. Friend thought, strengthens it. If Iwere an auditorI cannot help but feel that if I had to go every year to explain myself to the shareholders Iwould feel obliged to give more than the minimum of information which my hon. Friend said is now becoming a habit amongst auditors. I would feel obliged to make a full explanation to them because they were about to exercise the formal function of reappointing me. That would be the natural reaction for any auditor and to that extent I welcome Clause 14 and the changes that it makes.</span></p>
<p>12.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South (Mr. Parkinson) gave a most graphic and colourful account of the practices of auditors, if not their role. We all agree that it is desirable that their powers should be strengthened and that they should give as much information as possible in their report. The Government will carefully consider what has been said.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Upminster (Mr. Loveridge) is correct that I shall not claim that Clause 14 revolutionises the power of auditors but it does strengthen the link between them and shareholders and it at least makes shareholders positively consider the appointment of auditors every year. That underlines that auditors are responsible to the shareholders. If the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 352</span>
shareholders take advantage of the opportunity to throw out the auditor, that strengthens the shareholders' rights, especially if it is done contrary to the advice of the directors.<br><br>
The interesting debate that we have had does not call for a lengthy reply from me. The Government will consider the matter. There is no difference between the two sides about the need to alter the powers of auditors and to ensure that they give as much information as possible.</span></p>

RESIGNATION OF AUDITORS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wigley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 51, in page 18, line 28, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) An auditor who does not offer himself for re-election shall be deemed to have resigned for the purposes of subsection (2) below".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss Amendment No. 53, in page 18, line 35, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(3) An auditor voted out of office shall be required to submit a statement as outlined in subsection (2) above".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wigley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (2) of the clause is important because it requires that:
<br><blockquote><p>"An auditor's notice of resignation shall not be effective unless it contains either—
<ol>
<li>a statement to the effect that there are no circumstances connected with his resignation which he considers should be brought to the notice of the members or creditors of the company; or</li>
<li>a statement of any such circumstances as aforesaid."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
Those conditions should also apply in the case of an auditor who does not opt for re-election. This morning we have heard of the possibility that some auditors may be weaker than others, that some take the soft option or the easy way out. In circumstances that are not entirely as they should be and when the auditor is weak, it may be easy, bearing in mind the provisions of the Bill, for the auditor to take the easy way out and for him not to stand for re-election. Without an amendment of the kind that I suggest he could avoid the provisions of Clause
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0857">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 353</span>
15(2). For the sake of clarity and of ensuring that the provision stands, a strengthening of that provision is required.<br><br>
In Amendment No. 53 I propose that an auditor who is voted out of office should also be required to make a statement. The circumstances might not be so clear in the case where an auditor is taking the soft way out, but there may be circumstances known to him which should be brought to the attention of the shareholders. The auditor might have contrived deliberately to avoid any possibility of being involved the following year in the provisions of the clause. Perhaps the Government think that that circumstance is covered in some other way within the Bill, but my reading of it is that it is not. If it is not, I feel strongly that the provision should be made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are based upon representations made by accountancy bodies during consultations which the Department has had on the Bill. But they present considerable practical problems and I shall suggest a different approach at Report stage to take account of the argument. I sympathise with the proposals but I shall have to take a little time to explain the situation because it is a complex matter requiring careful consideration.<br><br>
We are not convinced that it is desirable or necessary to legislate on the lines proposed in the amendments, in the light of consultations which we have had. On the other hand, the Government accept that there is a loophole in Clause 15, as drafted. We are still engaged in consultations with the accountancy bodies and we shall try to deal with closing that loophole on Report.<br><br>
I shall first explain some of the objections to the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Will the Minister spell out what the loopholes are so that we can consider them before Report stage?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall do that.<br><br>
Clause 15 deals with the situation where an auditor resigns his office in mid-term because things are wrong with the company's affairs and he wants to avoid having to qualify the accounts and to have any further responsibility for the company's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 354</span>
affairs. In this situation, the interests of shareholders and creditors require that the auditor should not be able to resign quietly without saying anything. Clause 15 therefore, requires the auditor to make a statement. This will not only protect shareholders and creditors but will give an auditor who is in dispute with the directors a powerful sanction and put some backbone into a weak auditor who might otherwise fail to face up to his responsibilities.<br><br>
The case of an auditor who does not seek re-appointment at the annual general meeting or who is not re-elected is quite different. In this case, the auditor's term of office is, in any event, at an end. The question is only whether he should be re-appointed for a further term. In the normal course of events—and I will come to the exception to this in a moment—he will have completed his audit and, in particular, will have made and signed his audit report. If the accounts do not present a true and fair view of the company's position, the auditor will already have had to qualify his report. There is thus no need for a further statement if he does not wish to continue in office or is voted out of it, as the audit report itself provides an equivalent safeguard for shareholders.<br><br>
Even were a statement to be required in addition to the audit report, it would not be realistic to expect an auditor who was prepared to turn a blind eye to what was going on and to sign an unqualified report despite his personal misgivings, to be any more strong-minded when it came to making the statement. A requirement to make a statement would not therefore add anything in such circumstances.<br><br>
The auditor already has a right to speak at the annual general meeting and to make representations to the company if it is proposed to appoint someone in his place. The amendments are not therefore necessary in order to give an auditor the right to put his views before the company. There are also practical difficulties about the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has just said that the auditor already has a right to make a statement at the annual general meeting under Section 160 of the Companies Act 1948. It is therefore interesting to see how that fits in with Clauses 15 and 16 of the Bill. Perhaps he can explain how those clauses intermesh with Section 160
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0858">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 355</span>
of the Companies Act. Can he also tell the Committee how often, to his Department's knowledge, auditors have in recent years used their powers to speak at an annual general meeting?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with the amendments and come back to that. I do not know the answer to the question but I shall research the matter.<br><br>
Amendment No. 51 would require a statement to be made by an auditor who does not seek re-election. When would the statement have to be made? Presumably it should be made long enough before the annual general meeting to be circulated to shareholders in time for them to take it into account in considering the accounts and the appointment of his successor. But this would involve a complicated series of provisions and, in particular, would mean requiring the auditor to give notice that he would not be seeking re-election several weeks in advance of the meeting.<br><br>
There are similar but more difficult problems about Amendment No. 53. In this amendment, the Hon. Member is presumably primarily concerned with the case of the auditor who is not re-elected. Under the existing law, an auditor's reappointment annually is automatic and one can therefore talk about an auditor being "voted out of office", meaning that a resolution is moved not to reappoint him. However, under Clause 14 there must be a positive re-appointment each year. An auditor cannot, therefore, be voted out of office as such. Once he is appointed he serves for a full term unless he wishes to terminate his office. Neither the directors nor the company have any power to remove him. What we:are therefore concerned with is the case in which he puts himself forward for re-election but is not reappointed by the company. This would in itself be a sufficiently unusual event to alert the shareholders, creditors and public to the fact that some investigation of the company's affairs was desirable. It is not clear that requiring the auditor to make a statement would add anything to what he would already have had an opportunity of saying at the meeting and, in any case, the statement would come too late to be of real value.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wigley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that explanation. We are looking here at a small minority of auditors who are the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 356</span>
weaker persons in the community. Human nature being what it is, perhaps they will wish to retain their job. Circumstances will arise, particularly now that there is to be a positive motion for re-appointment, when they will, perhaps, hope for an easier life—until they find that no such motion has been moved. In those circumstances they will find they cannot continue as auditors. Is it not then possible that they will want to say more, but that the door will have been shut on them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is something in what the hon. Member has said. The problem is to shut every possible avenue to abuse. That is a little difficult and we should not allow a situation to develop where the best is the enemy of the good. If one tries to deal with every conceivable problem in a Bill, it might lead to such complex provisions that they become inoperative anyway. I want to look at the proposals because I am sympathetic to the hon. Member's objective.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
I come to the loophole which I think should be filled. In all normal circumstances the audited accounts are laid before the company at the annual general meeting at which the auditor's term of office expires. But there is no requirement to do that. The accounts simply have to be laid before the annual general meeting. There is, therefore, a possibility that an auditor may stand down at an annual general meeting at which no accounts are laid. Under the Bill such an auditor would not have completed his audit, nor would he be required to make a statement. We accept that that is an unsatisfactory situation. It is one that we should like to see cured. The best way of meeting this problem is to provide that the auditor's terms of office shall run, not, as is the case at present, until the end of the next annual general meeting, but to the end of the next general meeting at which the accounts are laid—that is until he has finished the job for which he was appointed.<br><br>
The object of that would be to ensure that in every case in which the auditor ceases to hold office, apart from death or incapacity of a total character, he would either have completed the audit or he would have to make a statement. There are problems about that situation which we are still considering with the accoun-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0859">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 357</span>
ancy bodies. That is why I say that I should like to come back on Report to deal with the propositions relating to that point.<br><br>
The auditor always has the right, under Section 14(7) of the 1967 Act, to speak at an annual general meeting. If it is proposed to appoint someone else, the auditor has additional rights, under Section 160 of the 1948 Act, to make representations at the annual general meeting. Although I shall try to carry out some research into the matter, it is unlikely that we shall succeed in having any means of discovering the position as to how often that right is used.<br><br>
The relationship between Section 160 of the 1948 Act and Clauses 15 and 16 is as follows. As drafted, Clause 15 applies to resignation mid-term, not at the annual general meeting. There is, therefore, little overlap. But Clause 16 will allow the auditor who has resigned to speak at the company's next annual general meeting on any matters which may affect him as a former auditor. I hope that that deals with the point raised by the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley), as in tabling these amendments he highlighted this loophole in Clause 15, which had not occurred to me. It clearly would be ridiculous if the appointment or resignation of an auditor should come up at an annual general meeting at which the accounts were not being laid. I am grateful that the Minister said that he would look into this situation with a view to so redrafting Clause 15 on Report that the appointment of an auditor, or his re-appointment, should be made co-terminus with his responsibilities. An auditor is responsible for an accounting year. His re-election, re-appointment or resignation should he considered in the light of the last set of accounts with which he is associated. However, I fear that Clause 15 may contain many more references to accounting reference periods. We also crossed that hurdle in carlier clauses of the Bill. But if that must be so, it must be so. Clearly, that is a loophole that must be closed.<br><br>
I listened with interest to what the hon. Member for Caernarvon said. I am in considerable sympathy with his
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 358</span>
attempts in these amendments to tighten up on the duties of auditors. I wonder whether it would be worth following the line that an auditor who resigns should not only have the right to make a statement at an annual general meeting but should be required to make a statement at the annual general meeting.<br><br>
I fully take the points made by the hon. Gentleman, and by the Minister in reply, that merely giving an opportunity to make a statement is unlikely to make the weak auditor vocal if he has not "got on" with the board of directors in the past and if he is now getting "out from under" as he thinks that the situation may get worse. He must think of his professional neighbourhood. He may well have other clients who are looking at him and saying "He caused a lot of frustration in that business. Although he has not caused trouble yet in our business, we do not want a difficult auditor. For that reason, we shall not have him." Human nature is human nature. Accountants must live. We must think of the best conditions under which they may practise their profession.<br><br>
There may be a case for considering a requirement that the auditor, in the circumstances envisaged, may make a statement at the annual general meeting. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for bringing forward these amendments and thus enabling us to look further at this somewhat grey area where the new Bill is trying to close the gaps in the 1948 Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wigley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his response.<br><br>
I should like to pick up the points made by the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton). I stress the question of the auditor who may, for various reasons, leave the employ of a company. I suggest that the Minister may look further at this. There may be four or five standard questions that should he put in in those circumstances so that an auditor shall meet certain points head on and not evade them. Perhaps there should be a provision in respect of those auditors who may otherwise take an easy way out because of any implications there might be on their other clients and possible future business. There should be a duty for auditors to meet points that may arise.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0860">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 359</span>
I must be honest. I had not picked up in detail one of the loopholes to which the Minister referred. I am grateful to the Minister for underlining it and saying that it will be met on Report. I do not think that there is any difference of mind between the Members of the Committee on this question. I shall not press these amendments, in view of the assurances I have received from the Minister that he will look between now and Report at the way in which some aspects of this matter may be met.<br><br>
There must be no room for those who are in the worst circumstances—and perhaps the weakest people—to get away with some matters. That is not the intention of this Bill. If anything may be done on Report to meet the fears that have been expressed, and which were accepted by the Minister, all members of the Committee will be grateful.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Crawshaw. I am a little concerned about the progress which has been made hitherto. I have not previously sought to move that the Committee should meet at additional sittings as I wanted to see what progress it was going to make. Nevertheless, I think that we must take that into account. It is not my desire that the Committee should necessarily sit in the week of August when the House is convened if that may be avoided, as some hon. Members have family and other commitments outside the House.<br><br>
I refer to the matter of afternoon sittings. I must recognise the facts of political life in a Committee on which the Government do not have a majority. I therefore hope to persuade the Committee to agree with me on this matter.<br><br>
Although the proposals in this Bill are moderate, it has become clear that they have some significance. It is the view of the professional bodies, and of virtually everyone who is concerned in this area, that the Bill should be enacted. However, there is no possibility of its being enacted unless we complete our proceedings before the House rises for the Summer Recess. I do not wish to curtail the debate. I merely mention this point at this stage to give notice that Ishould like the Com-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 360</span>
mittee to consider the position as from next Tuesday. I do not think that I should have a right to move a Sittings Motion to sit on Thursday afternoon. However, I want to give notice now that I may wish to move that on Thursday morning to take effect from the Tuesday and the following Thursday. I hope that that will not be necessary. I think it is right that I should alert the Committee to the possibilities so that members of the Committee may consider the position. I do not sense that there is deep opposition to the Bill. Perhaps hon. Members think that the Bill is inadequate, but that is not the point. We are dealing with whether the Bill should be put on the statute book. I feel very firmly that it should. It would be a great disadvantage if that did not happen. I hope that I may gain the co-operation of the Committee on that matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Crawshaw. There is no difference between the two sides of the Committee on the need to improve the law on auditing and company accounts. I think we made that clear all the way along. Indeed, our main burden has been that the Government are not moving with sufficient pace in the widespread reform of company law. The background is that the Government are guillotining vast numbers of Bills on the Floor of the House so as to complete their programme. Therefore, it is something of an impertinence of the Minister to suggest that there should be afternoon sittings. It is not our fault that the Government are sitting in August. We did not ask them to sit in August. If the Government have put forward too much legislation for the House to deal with in the proper way at a proper time, that is another matter. If Parliament is sitting for the Minister's convenience—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not for my convenience.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do the Minister an injustice. It is not for his convenience. We shall all be here for the convenience of the Government. Be that as it may. It has not been the intention of the Opposition to delay the proceedings on this Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brian Sedgemore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What have the Opposition been doing this morning?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0861">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 361</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A large amount me this morning, and virtually half, or a substantial part, of the last sitting was taken up, not by Opposition amendments, but by an amendment moved by a Government back bencher.<br><br>
I believe that we are right to give careful consideration to this matter. The right course of action is for us to seek to make progress. There are a number of matters which must be considered. I see no reason why we should resort to afternoon sittings rather than, if necessary, the House and the Committee proceeding at the normal pace until the House rises. If the Government say that there will be one length of time on the Floor of the House and another length of time upstairs in Committee, that would be a curious arrangement. We either sit in August, or we do not. If we sit in August, the Committee as well as the House should sit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ido not mind.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 362</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>:In the event that may not prove to be necessary.<br><br>
The Minister was ill-advised to say anything this morning. Let us see how matters proceed. I hope that we shall make reasonable progress and continue to discuss matters—not least the matters raised by the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley), which are entirely non-partisan and which will improve the nature of company law. That is the right approach. It should not be necessary to make any change in the sittings arrangements. There are a considerable number of sittings to go before the end of the month. We shall have to see what progress is made. It would be wrong for the Minister to try to steamroller the Bill through.</span></p>
