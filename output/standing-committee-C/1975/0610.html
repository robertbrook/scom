	<p>No. 36, in page 6, line 5, after the word " up ", to insert the words

	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Jeger. I should like to welcome you to our proceedingson this fascinating, non controversial measure. You will know that in previous sittings it was agreed with Mr. English, your predecessor as Chairman, that the Committee should adjourn tosuch time as the Government were ready to proceed, given the fact that further consideration of the Bill was necessary before going ahead with the debate on clauses then outstanding. My understanding was that the Committee would resume when the Government were in a position to proceed, which is why we sat earlier this week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None the less, as is well known, this is a highly technical measure which requires a great deal of consultation inside and outside the House, and my hon. Friends and I had thought to putdown sensible amendments. We were, therefore, somewhat disconcerted to find that, after we had resumed last Tuesday, the Government amendments were seeking to amend had been withdrawn and other Government amendments had been substituted for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to you, Mrs. Jeger, that this is not a satisfactory way for the Government to proceed. If they were ready last Tuesday, they should have had their amendments sorted out so thatwe could put down suitable amendments to them, if necessary. My understanding is that they have been tabling different amendments and withdrawing amend-
	<span class='label label-info column'>356</span>
ments, and that makes life for the Opposition extremely difficult, because it becomes hard for us to discharge our duty. I hope we can have an assurance from the Under-Secretary that he will do everything possible to avoid any repetition of this because otherwise we are doingthe job twice over—amending amendments which are subsequently withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that this matter arises on Amendment No. 36, but perhaps I can help the Committee by saying that the circumstances have been taken into account in the selection of " starred " Amendments (a), (b) and (c) to Amendment No. 64 which I hope will help the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Clinton Davis)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mrs. Jeger. I, too, welcome you to the Committee. I am sure that you will enjoy the proceedings enormously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) will appreciate that what has been happening is that my officials and the professional bodies have been working together continuously to try toarrive at a compromise on some of the difficulties which have arisen. We have succeeded in art, but in some cases not as much as I had hoped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original amendment that was put down had to be expanded in the light of the further discussions which took place. That was the view that my officials considered appropriate, and I accepted their preferred advice. I am sorry if it has led to inconvenience for the Committee,but I think it is better that the discussions should have taken place. If we found it necessary—as we did—to give consideration to a further alteration to what had originally been proposed, I think in the final analysis it can only be to the benefit of the committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, this is not the final word, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept thatthere was no question of deliberately inconveniencing or misleading the Committee in any way.If, as has happened, the Opposition found themselves in a difficulty, I should have been the first to have proposed, had you not anticipated it, Mrs. Jeger, that their " starred " amendments should be considered for debate today together with the other propositions which we are to discuss.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1148">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>357</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that same point of order, Mrs. Jeger. May I also welcome you to the Committee?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is important to make this point. It is not just a matter of inconvenience, but thequestion is whether we have adequate time to consider these highly technical matters and, therefore, to debate them properly in this Committee. It is very important that that should be on the record, because it will have a further importance at Report Stage in regard to what steps might be taken then and how the Chair should consider the selection of amendments there. Mr. Clinton Davis: I accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not being critical. I simply want to place these facts on record, as they are relevant to the later stages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 64 is not the result of discussions, not the result of such an agreed formula reached there. The difference between Amendment No. 64 and Amendment No. 46 is the addition of the new subsection (1)(a), which is intended, I think, to go some way towards meeting points that I raised. But they are not agreed by me, nor, as far as I know, by anybody. I do not believe that that formula has been discussed with anybody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we come to it fresh this morning. I think in such a situation it would be quite impossibleto treat it as more than a draft about which we can all talk, and quite impossible at this short notice to form firm conclusions about its acceptability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like it put on record that in the early hours of the morning, two days ago, I tabledamendments to Amendment No. 46, only to be told, at half-past one in the morning, that there was no longer any Amendment No. 46.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that if this happens in future it would be not merely a courtesy but helpful to ourdiscussions if, at the same time as an amendment was withdrawn and another one substituted, we were given a copy of the amendment being substituted. If that had happened, we would at least have had that much more time. But it has not happened and, therefore I suggest that we can discuss Amendment No. 64 only as a first draft, rather than as a matter on which we can reach a firm conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>358</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I emphasise that we are not suggesting that the Under-Secretary is deliberately trying to foul up the proceedings. We accept that he is trying to improve the Bill. The last thing we want to do is to prevent him from moving different amendments if they are better than those which he originally tabled; that is our objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I emphasise the point made by my hon. and learned Friend that it is necessary for the Opposition as well as for the Government to keep in touch with outside bodies who are advising both sides on these highly technical points. If a situation of the kind described by my hon. and learned Friend occurs, an Opposition Member is put in great dif-ficulty when he attempts to table an amendment to a Government amendment and discovers that the Government Amendment has been withdrawn and a new one substituted. First, he does not necessarily have the new Government amendment at that point and, secondly, it certainly is not possible at that stage in the proceedings to find those who are in any way able to advise on the meaning of the Government amendment. One has only to look at the Amendment Paper to realise that the drafting of an amendment to amend an amendment of that complexity cannot be done in 12 hours. Therefore, whilst I appreciate that a " starred " amendment is to be called—it would be intolerable if I might presume to say so for any other situation to prevail—it is not the question of whether amendments are starred or not. but a question of whether any Opposition Member, however efficient, is capable of tabling the amendments which are necessary to sort matters out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to pursue the point longer or to delay the matter, but if the Government cannotat any rate give us advance notice of such changes, the right course of action, possibly, is to delay the Committee's proceedings for, say, one sitting so that we have an opportunity, given other pressures on the Department of Trade and its Ministers and the Shadow Ministers, tosort this question out with outside bodies. I hope that the Under-Secretary can ensure thatthat is the position in future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now may we return to Amendment No. 36?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1149">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>359</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On another point of order, Mrs. Jeger. It relates to Amendment (c). There is a misprint. The sooner attention is drawn to the misprint, the better. The third line reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"notice in the prescribed manner of an application to impose a judgment".</p></blockquote>
It should read, " to enforce a judgment". Perhaps we should treat that as merely a printing error.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I thank the hon. and learned Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We proceed with the amendment which was being discussed when the Committee last sat regarding the disqualification of directors of insolvent companies. We had, in fact, only just started the debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) having moved the amendment, and I was in the process of saying that it may be that someone was in the position of having been a director of a company which had become insolvent and had fulfilled the other criteria laid down many years previously, perhaps 20 or 25 years ago. ndeed, it may have happened on no fewer than two occasions, perhaps for related reasons. Perhaps the two companies were in the same line of business—it seems not unlikely—or perhaps the insolvencies occurred in a depressed economic period such as the 1930s, when a very large number of companies, through no fault of the directors, were going insolvent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would, I think, be quite unreasonable if the Government, who are now changing the law, in this case were to say that such a person, who perhaps had had an impeccable record in the interim and been in charge of many companies which had done extremely well, should now suddenly be penalised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that if this retrospective element were not introduced, it would be some time before the full effect of the Government's proposals came into operation. Obviously, there will he some directors in the position that I have described—though not many, I suspect—who would be disqualified if we accepted the clause as it stands but would not be disqualified if we accepted the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that the numbers are small is to be borne in mind, as is the need to avoid unnecessary restrospection. That is why this is not an unimportant amend-
	<span class='label label-info column'>360</span>
ment. I think it is something which clearly ought to be done. It would be quite wrong if people, for offences—if offences they be—or for actions which took place before theBill was passed, found themselves caught by its provisions as a result of a change in the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That being so—after all, the desire on both sides of the Committee is to improve the Bill—I hope that the Under-Secretary will not feel it necessary to take a rigid view onthis or feel that he is defending an entrenched position of great moment. I do not think thatis true. We should accept the amendment, and I hope he is able to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher-Cooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I should like to add one word to what my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) said. We are not discussing offences, of course. They are events which took place. perhaps without any kind of turpitude on the part of the person concerned, and, as my hon. Friend has said, many years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extraordinary, in a day and age when we are keen to see actual offences regarded as erased by recent legislation" spent " is the technical term—that, in this area, when they are not really offences at all but mere events, they should not be regarded as " spent". Whenone adds to that the concept of retrospection or retroactivity, whichever be the right word, if one piles that Pelion upon the other Ossa. it seems to me that the case for ignoring events before the coming into force of the Bill is in all conscience very strong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I think it can be said of this amendment that the importance of it has become more and more apparent as the debate has proceeded. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke) has pointed out that this section is not concerned with offences, although we start with the proposition that there is not necessarily any turpitude in what the man has done, and certainly there is nothing in the nature of a criminal offence, yet the penalties which may be visited upon him under this section are very severe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing only with subparagraph (i) of paragraph (	<i>a</i>) of Clause 7. The whole operation of subparagraph (i) hangs on the combination of both subparagraph (i) and (ii)—namely, there has to have been the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1150">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>361</span>
insolvency of two companies and not just one company. All this amendment is saying is that the first insolvency—namely, that in subparagraph (i)—must have been an insolvency subsequent to the passing of the Act. It is accepted that the insolvency of the second company may have been up to five years before—therefore accepting that element of retrospection or retroactivity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A note given to me by an expert practising in this particular area was that this amendment was unnecessary because that was the view that a court would take, anyway. n considering subparagraph (i), it would say " This is a paragraph which imposes penalties or leads to the imposing of penalties. Therefore, we must interpret it as not being retrospective." Of course, when it went on to consider subparagraph (ii), which refers to five years before the events in subparagraph (i) it would then be obliged to accept the element of retroactivity. Therefore, I thought that what the Minister would be saying in answer to this amendment was that it was not necessary. because that is the interpretation that a court would put upon subparagraph (i), anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, this is not so. Not only does the Minister say that that is not the interpretation, but he says " We do not intend it to have that interpretation. We intend subparagraph (i) to be retrospective as well as subparagraph (ii)." That is very serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us look at the uncertainties that exist in subsection (1). n our debate on the previous amendment, we went into one area in which uncertainties will arise—namely, the ambiguity of these conditions: whether or not they catch somebody who resigned the daybefore the company went insolvent. If they catch somebody who resigned the day before a company went insolvent, how far back do they catch somebody'? There is very great uncertainty in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, this debate has introduced a whole new area of uncertainty. Is it, in fact, intendedthat the court should 	<i>interpret</i> subparagraph (i) as being retrospective? Is it intended that, whenever a company was wound up, the fact that a person was a directorof that company at the time will bring subparagraph (i) into operation? I hope most strongly that that is not what the Government intend. That really would be monstrous. The Minister
	<span class='label label-info column'>362</span>
may say that the court still has a discretion whether or not to make an order, but a manought not to be put in peril of even being called upon to say why an order should not bemade in circumstances as uncertain as these provisions stand at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If subparagraph (i) is intended to be retrospective in its effect, how far back does it go? We should have a specific answer to that question. I think the answer is that if subparagraph (i) is intended to be retrospective, it is retrospective without any limits. If that is right, once one faces up to that fact and says that it is retrospective without any limit of time at all, one must come to the conclusion that it cannot stand in thatform and that it ought to have the amendment which is proposed in Amendment No. 36.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another area of uncertainty which is linked with this one in a way in which I shall show in a few minutes. Later we shall come to the question of how the time is measured under subparagraph (ii). What is meant by—
	<br><blockquote><p>"which has been wound up within five years of the winding up"?</p></blockquote>
How does one measure within five years of the winding up? How does one measure when thatfiveyears starts? Is it five years from the time when the winding up started, or is it five yearsfrom the time when the winding up ended? For this purpose we have to look at subsection (7) which defines what it means by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>" … the winding up of a company shall be taken to occur … "</p></blockquote>
and then goes on to state the circumstances in which it shall be taken to occur. If the Minister can apply all those provisions and answer my questions in simple form, he will have my unstinted admiration. So this is another area of uncertainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment is made, we know when time starts to run under subparagraph (i) and, if we know that, at least we have a starting point for arguing what is meant by subparagraph (ii). But if we are uncertain about both, where does the poor, unfortunate person who may be affected by these provisions stand'? What advice could lawyers give them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an unsatisfactory subsection. The debate thus far has been useful in highlighting some of the unsatisfactory features of it. The Minister gave what many of us regarded as an undertaking to do something to put right the first earlier
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1151">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>363</span>
ambiguity to which l referred. It may well he that, in the course of doing that, he can also put right this area of ambiguity. I only hope he will but it would be an indicationof good intention and a step forward if he were at least to accept this small amendment which would make it clear that we know from what time subparagraph (i) can operate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While there is an element of retrospection in this matter, the Opposition have exaggerated its importance out of all proportion. It is well to recall that a great dealof attention has been paid to the views of the professional organisations who have been in touch with my Department and myself and with the Opposition, and I pay tribute to them for that. At no time have we had representations made to us by Justice or the Law Societyabout this specific matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that the reason for that is that in their thinking they are on all fours with theGovernment. Their view is that society needs to be protected from the activities of people who fall within the ambit of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear, from what the Opposition have said, that they do not object, in principle, to the objectives of this clause. They believe as we do, that society needs to be protected not only against the fraudulent—that is capable of being dealt with under the provisions of Section 188—but against those who are unfit by reason of conduct, which would have to be established to the satisfaction of a court, to be concerned in the management of a company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said last time that I took the view that already a person would be allowed one bite at the cherry. I need not rehearse that argument again, except to say that, of course, we are dealing with a position where subparagraphs (i) and (ii) have to be dealt with conjunctively. That was not referred to by the hon. and learned Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the Minister has missed my point. I was saying that sub paragraph(ii) depends on sub paragraph (i). Unless one can tell when subparagraph (i) comes into operation, one cannot begin to work out when subparagraph (ii) operates. I thought that I had madeit very clear that the two hang together. The difficulty in subparagraph (i), to which this amendment is directed,
	<span class='label label-info column'>364</span>
carries on into subparagraph (ii).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It' I have misunderstood the lion. and learned Gentleman, I apologise. It was my fault, I am sure. rather than his, because he argues cogently and clearly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I believe that it is right to submit to the Committee, as was anticipated by the hon. and learned Gentleman, that this is a matter for the discretion of the court. It is not thatevery director—every poor and unfortunate person, as this category of persons was described by the hon. and learned Gentleman—would, in fact, be penalised. The hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) was wrong in that sense. Perhaps he was not using the word "penalised" in its strict form but was seeking to say that people in this position would be subjected to a degree of anxiety. On reflection, I think that he probably would say that, because clearly it is for the courts to determine whether someone is penalised and, in so doing, the court must have regard to all the circumstances of a specific case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I do not want to do in these circumstances is unduly to restrict, as I think the courts would be restricted by the operation of this amendment, the discretion of the court. I do notaccept the logic behind the Opposition's submissions on this, that these people should be excluded from consideration of their actions by a court where a subsequent insolvency has arisen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the period of over two years that I have been a Minister, I have had representations from Members of Parliament on all sides of the House about the activities of people who have been involved in a series of insolvencies. Hon. Members have asked why we have not done something about it in due time. These people have preyed upon society and itis quite objectionable that they should be permitted so to do. This position should notbe prolonged. I do not believe that they should be given this additional possibility of extricating themselves from a situation in which by their actions they have sought to jeopardise the interests of ordinary men and women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason I believe it is right that there should be this provision, albeit that there is this element of retrospection. I do not propose to quote the hon. Gentleman's words, but he said that the House
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1152">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>365</span>
of Commons does not always object to retrospective legislation. One has to consider a case on its merits. In my submission the merits here are overwhelming. I believe that if one considered the views of the vast majority of members of the public and Members of this House, one would find that the action the Government propose to take here is wholly in accordance with the requirements of society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the Under-Secretary is letting his oratory run away with him inhis peroration. What is at issue here is not the basic point on which we are all agreed—namely, that the situation should be changed as far as the future is concerned. We are concerned about the position of individuals who will be affected if this amendment is not operated and may indeed he affected retrospectively in a way which certainly they have never expected at any previous stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Protecting the public is not the main point at issue. It is the question of protecting individuals against retrospective legislation. We are in some difficulty here and it is something on which I have had experience in the past. My hon. and learned Friends rightlypointed out that there is no question of an offence having been committed. It is not an offence, but an event—something which has happened in the past, hit her to in no way an offence. deed, itmay not have involved the person in doing anything disreputable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet we suddenly find that, as a result of this event which may have taken place decades ago, the person concerned is suddenly penalised. I use the expression in the broad sense, not in the technical sense. Having used it in the broad sense I come back to what is actually happening. If it is not an offence, then it is a rather strange animal with which we are dealing, and it is relevant to the question of retrospection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that one of the Law Officers is present. I think I am right in saying that, generally, the House has from time to time changed the law in such a way that it has retrospective effect as far as civil liability is concerned. I believe I would be right in saying thatexcept by accident—I know of one accidental case—the House has never changed the law
	<span class='label label-info column'>366</span>
in such a way as to make someone retrospectively a criminal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hate to use the word "hybrid", but the animal we have here is a hybrid. It does not appear either to be a civil offence, because it is not an offence, nor a criminal offence,because it is not an offence: yet none the less the person concerned is in the broad sense to be penalised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the Under-Secretary to say that we exaggerate the importance of this seems to me quite wrong. We do not exaggerate it as far as the individual is concerned because it may indeed bethe case that his livelihood is at stake. The person may be the director ofa company and many other companies. If the clause is not amended it may be that he will find that some event in the past suddenly creates a situation in which he can no longer continue as a director of these various companies and his livelihood can be at stake. That is a very heavy penalty indeed, though he has committed no offence, either criminal or civil. In addition, it is not only his livelihood that may be affected. It means thathe will have to explain to all those with whom he has business connections otherwise that he has to resignfrom perhaps a number of boards as a result of something which happened in 1920, and which was neither then an offence nor is now an offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To say that one exaggerates the importance of that on the individual concerned is simplynot true. I hope, therefore, in his understand able and justified enthusiasm for improving the situation in the future, the Under-Secretary will not think it right to pursue the line which he has so far taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that one of the Law Officers is present, because this matter raises an interesting set of proposals in the matter of retrospection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, there are the other matters which have been raised as to whether, once again, the drafting of the Bill is uncertain. My hon. and learned Friend has suggested that the courts would, anyway, even if the amendment were not carried, interpret the drafting in such a way that it was held not to he effective retrospectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Under-Secretary pursues the course of saying that it ought to be retrospective—I hope he will not—he should at least make that clear. That being so,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1153">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>367</span>
the drafting should be tidied up. But perhaps the Law Officers would confirm whether or not they expect the courts to interpret it as having retrospective effect or without retrospective effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point is how many bites of the cherry one is having. Surely the right approachwould be to say " No more bites from now on." But to say that all previous bites of the cherry should also be taken into account is to raise again something which has long since been digested and buried in the past. I do not think that the three bites of the cherry argument stands up to examination in any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Under-Secretary will bear that in mind. Perhaps the Solicitor-General would comment on the more technical legal points, on which I am in no way a expert compared with others who have spoken. None the less, they appear to raise important points of principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not surprising that the representations have not been received from the Law Society and the Bar Council, because they may have been interpreting the paragraph in the way that my hon. Friend has suggested and, therefore, thought that there was no danger of the kind of difficulty I have been describing. The others who are affected have not made representations because the last thing they will have expected is suddenly to find themselves removed from their existing boards because of something they did many years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I doubt very much whether the publicity which has been given to these interesting debates has been such as to alert all those directors—although there may not be many—who are in this position to the dangers in which they stand. It is our duty to represent those difficulties and ensure that the effect that the clause, as drafted, could have on them is brought home, debated and considered in the proper manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Under-Secretary will reconsider the matter and give a more satisfactory answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It congratulate my hon. Friend on his grasp of the law in these matters. We shall probably have to give him silk before we have finished our Committee proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has covered all the points except one to which I should like to refer. The Under-Secretary said that
	<span class='label label-info column'>368</span>
there had been no representations from outside bodies on this matter. I think the reason is probably as my hon. Friend said. I do not know what the Minister and his assistants did about it, but when this amendment was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) I asked the outside interests what they thought about it and whether it was good or bad, and I must confess I thought that the Minister's experts or the Minister himself would do the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me tell the Committee the answer I received from a member of the Committee of Justice and a leading silk in these matters. He wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We agree. This only makes explicit what is (probably) the effect of the clause as drafted. It is ipconceivable that the court would give retrospective effect to a penal or quasi-penal sanction."</p></blockquote>
Then he put this wise question at the end:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Why waste the taxpayers' money by inviting possible litigation on the point?"</p></blockquote>
Let us have it one way or the other. This difficulty can be resolved in one of two ways. The Government can accept the amendment which makes it clear that subparagraph (i) only relates to winding-up subsequent to the passing of the Bill: if we pass the amendment it is made clear in that way. But, if the Minister wants it to be retrospective, let him put forward an amendment saving whether it is to be before or after the passing of the Bill, and the issue can he debated on the straight basis 	<i>of</i> knowing what the result would be. If that is what the Minister wants, let him put forward an amendment to clarify the provisions up that way. But hope, before he does so, lie will think very carefully about the effects of that. At least, we would resolve ap issue which might otherwise he the subject of litigation. But it would mean that subparagraph (i) would relate to any winding up, whether before or after the passing of the Bill, however old and stale it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not enough to say that the court still has discretion whether Or not to make an order. The effect of that amendment would be to put a man in peril of at least being brought before the court, even if he might persuade the court not to make an order, in respect of an insolvency, whenever it occurs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge upon the Minister these two points. Let us have this difficulty resolved one way or the other—and in the way this amendment Proposes, rather than by the only alternative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assert again that the Opposition have exaggerated the importance of this, and I shall adduce another argument, which has only just occurred to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition were responsible for the Insurance Act 1973, and that Act gave Draconian powers to the Secretary of State for Trade in determining whether a person was a fit and proper person to be the manager or controller of an insurance company. Relevant to the right hon. Gentleman's considerations on these matters must have been the conduct of such an individual in the past, and it did not matter how far that past went back. There is no potent difference between that situation and this one. Both were designed to protect society from people who were unworthy of being involved in the management of an insurance company or, in this case, concerned in the management of a company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not dealing here with a situation where someone will be sent to prison—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not dealing with insurance companies, either, where it has always been recognised that somewhat different considerations apply to the generality of companies. I do not want to press that point too far but, none the less, the hon. Gentleman will agree that there is some distinction between the law on insurance companies and the law in general.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is some difference, but I believe the principle to, apply here, which is to protect society, is precisely the same. The other point I want to make in relation tothis is that the disqualified director will not be subjected under this provision to any criminal sanction with regard to the court. deed, he may continue to act as a director, providing that he has the leave of the court. Re does not inevitably lose his means of livelihood by reason of the disqualification there. It is a risk, but so should it be a risk. That is the difference between the Opposition and the Government in this Committee, because I believe I carry my hon. Friends wholly with me on this issue. It is a risk which it is proper that such a person should assume.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke) made the that, in this day and age, convictions for criminal offences are erased in
	<span class='label label-info column'>370</span>
certain circumstances after a period of time. If that is true, so be it. But, for any professional body with a code of discipline, that provision does not necessarily apply. It is right that company directors should be moulded to the requirements of a code of discipline. In a sense, this is part of a movement in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not prepared to say to the Opposition that I will accept their amendment. I believe that it is misconceived. I believe that the Conservative Party has, in a somewhat similar situation, accepted an element of retrospection, and rightly so, in circumstances to which I have already alluded. I hope, therefore, that the Committee will be able to proceed towards that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the point the hon. Gentleman has just thought up, I think there has always been a distinction between company law in general and the law applying to insurance companies. That is something that ought to be borne in mind in this context. With respect to the hon. Gentleman, the situation is not the same in the two cases. One is the effect on those who are insuring, while this is a broader question altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point is that if the Minister wants to do it on a fit and proper person basis, of course he can do so. No, doubt the Secretary of State, in taking a view on that, may take into account past events. But that is very different from the animal with which we are concerned here where it is a specific question of fact which is involved and not a question of judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister suggests that it is not inevitable that, as a result of not accepting this amendment, people will be deprived of their livelihood. It may be the case that someone will be deprived of his livelihood as a result of not accepting this amendment. If that is so, whether it is a criminal penalty, civil penalty or whatever, being deprived of one's livelihood is not unimportant, to say nothing of one's reputation which may also suffer as a resultof something which has happened in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that this is a risk which the person concerned should assume. if we leave the clause as it is, il is a risk which he cannot conceivably avoid as a result of something which hap-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1155">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>371</span>
pened, perhaps, 20 or 30 years ago and which in any case was something which in no way could be condemned. It is a very strange sort of situation where this risk is to be assumed as the Under-Secretary says. It is not to be assumed. It is a peril in which he is going to be placed as a result of our legislating retrospectively in the way that the Minister would like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to my third point, to which the Under-Secretary has not replied. I assume, therefore, that the Law Officer who is present will do so. This relates to what is his interpretation of the clause as it stands. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) pointed out that our advice is that the courts will, anyway, be likely to interpret this clause in the way which the amendment suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I thought I made that abundantly plain. The court's discretion should not be made more rigid. I believe that the court should have regard to these circumstances and therefore I accept the view that there is an element of retrospection, and the court will have to take the circumstances which emerge from the past fully into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am afraid the hon. Gentleman is not being very bright this morning. That is not the point at issue at all. The point is whether or not the court will be likely to interpret it as the hon. Gentleman believes it is at present drafted or in the light of our amendment. Our advice is that the courts are likely to come to the view on the clause as now drafted that our amendment is the correct interpretation. That is not the same point that the hon.Gentleman intervened on a moment or two ago. It means that the matter is obscure. It does notgive the court discretion, but means, as far as we understand, that our amendment is likely to be unnecessary, and that our view on the whole issue will prevail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Law Officer's advice is to the contrary, no doubt he will let us know. But it cannot just be left in limbo where we are not sure and where litigation will he necessary to establish what the position is. There is no point in this Committee legislating in such a way that the matter is subsequently decided in court, with the court, in effect, determining whether the hon. Gentleman's policy, or our policy, prevails. It is not right that it should be
	<span class='label label-info column'>372</span>
drafted in such a way that it is obscure and the determination of policy is left to the court. I hope the hon. Gentleman understands that point. I am puzzled that he did not grasp it thefirst time round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we might have the advice of the Solicitor-General about the Government's view of the likely interpretation of the clause as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put it quite precisely, and specifically ask for the advice of the Law Officer? The question is this. We are talking about. line 5, paragraph (i), which reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"is or has been a director of an insolvent company which is being or has been wound up".</p></blockquote>
Does that mean is being or has been wound up subsequent to the passing of the Act, or does it mean is being or has been wound up, whether before or after the passing of the Act?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the hon. Gentleman that I read out the advice from a leading " silk " who said that it would be interpreted as meaning subsequent to the passing of the Act, but the Minister seems to think it means whether before or after the passing of the Act. So could the Law Officer please tell us which, in his view, is the correct interpretation? I hope then that the Committee will say that it should he made clear by having an amendment to make it clear what it does mean.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General (Mr. Peter Archer)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I intervene only because the hon. and learned. Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) asked me to do so. Let me say that I am always anxious, if possible, to assist a Committee. In my experience, however, one is not very helpful to a Committee if one comes in halfway through a debate, particularly if one's mind has been concentrated on sorting out something for the next debate, and attempts to give an off-the-cuff interpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. and learned Gentleman cares to have a word with me about this between now and Report, I shall be very happy to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Speaking personally, I quite expected that the Solicitor-General would not know. I have asked him several questions, so I would rather not have an answer at the moment. I appreciate his difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think the Minister was direct-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1156">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>373</span>
ing his mind to the two points which I raised. One is, what does it mean, and the second is, what do we intend it to mean? If the Solicitor-General would direct his mind to the first of those questions and discuss it with us later, we could possibly arrive at a solution to the problem then, rather than now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Might I press the Solicitor-General on this matter? I understand the point made by my hon. and learned Friend, and obviously it is desirable that we should have an authoritative opinion, which is why the matter was first raised. None the less, will not the Solicitor-General agree that the matter is obscure at the moment? Certainly it is not sufficiently clear for him to give an immediate answer. Will he agree further that, if that is so, it requires to be clarified?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, we come to the next question. It is all very well the Solicitor-General saying that he will have a chat with my hon. and learned Friend between now and Report. That is very cosy. It may be that it will be generally agreed that the whole matter is obscure and must be resolved one way or the other. We shall then have an amendment tabled one way or the other—we hope on the lines of our amendment—before Report. But the matter by then will have gone very far, and there will not be adequate time for us to consult outside bodies. Not only the legal bodies, but the CBI, the Institute of Directors, and a number of otherswill have views to express, but we shall not know until the last moment what the meaning of the Bill is, let alone know the right policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think it is very satisfactory to proceed on this basis. I am not sure how we can leave it in limbo for the moment and come back to it, other than by adjourning the Committee.I do not want to do that, and it would be unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>374</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It raises the question of extent to which' the Government's legal advisers have been consulted on the drafting of the Bill and adequate preparatory work has been done. Quite clearly the alternative is to adjourn the Committee, and the hon. and learned Gentleman can give us a view. But we are in the dilemma that we shall not know the Government's view until just before Report which means that we shall not have a chance to get the matter clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister agree that it is right that the drafting should be clear rather than a matter which requires intensive legal consultation, dispute and possible litigation? Clearly we should have either our amendment or an amendment in the contrary sense. I do not see that that can seriously be disputed. If that is so, I cannot understand why the Government do not make the matter clear beyond doubt, without going into all the legal palaver which is otherwise involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the main policy point, I am sure we are absolutely right and I should not wish to let the amendment go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the main policy point, I think the issues are abundantly plain. I think I have the support of my hon. Friends when I say that, in fact, the court should be able to take into account the conduct of a director going back into the past prior to the enactment of the Bill. I think these are relevant factors, and I make that abundantly plain, as I thought I had done on several previous occasions. That is the issue of policy between us. As for the wording of the provisions, we had that debate earlier, and we are now examining the position as a result of Amendment No. 58.

	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 59, in page 6, line 16, after "period", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"commencing on the date of the order and".</p></blockquote>
This is an amendment put forward by outside bodies. I do not know whether the Government have taken any advice from outside bodies. If they have, I imagin?, they will have been given the same reasons that I have been given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me read the reasons that were put forward by a member of the Bar practising in this area who proposed the amendment with the approval, I understand, of the working party. He says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The present wording is taken from Section 188(1) of the Companies Act 1948. Unfortunately, by judicial decision, such words only give power to the court to make an order with effect from a past date, that is, the winding up. If, as is usual, it takes some time to bring the matter before the court, the period of disqualification is much reduced ",</p></blockquote>
and he says that in his experience he has met cases under Section 188 where the result has been that the apparent five-year period has been reduced to a maximum possible of 10 months because of those factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This may merely be another doubt-removing provision—I do not know—put forward from a practical source, a source which is desirous of removing any doubts and of removing the danger which might result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that any one of us would wish for that consequence. On the last amendment the Minister suggested that there was a question of principle between us, but there is not. On the question of what facts attract the penalty, there is a difference. We have just voted on it. But, subject to that, there is no difference about this. Once a penalty has been attracted it should be an effective penalty, an identifiable penalty, and not one the effective length of which depends on such factors as how long it takes for a case to come up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will be able to say that this amendment clarifies something which might otherwise be a subject for litigation. May I point out how often in this Committee, as in the House, it is lawyers who say "For heaven's sake remove something which might leave room for argument". We do not want to see the lawfull of points which may be the
	<span class='label label-info column'>376</span>
subject of litigation. I am sure that the Solicitor-General would agree. We are always trying to persuade our lay colleagues to have some sense. I do not really mind if someone says " That is what it means anyway". If that is what it means let us put the words in and make certain that that is what it means. Then there cannot be any argument about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I have listened with some sympathy to the hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival). This amendment does not actually secure the objective he has sought to outline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understood it, before the hon. and learned Gentleman spoke, the purpose of the amendment was to ensure that the maximum period of disqualification could not extend beyond five years following the date of the disqualification order, but I think that that is not the construction he places on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the amendment is unnecessary because the wording of this clause is identical to that of Section 188 of the Companies Act 1948. n the case of Regina v. Bradley 1961, in 1. All England Reports, page 669, the contention that it permitted a disqualification order to start from the date other than the date of order, for example, the end of a term of imprisonment, was rejected. In paragraph 81 of the Jenkins Report, the Company Law Committee, in June 1962, accepted that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As section 188 is now drafted the period of disqualification runs concurrently with any period of imprisonment imposed on the director concerned".</p></blockquote>
This construction accords with ordinary principles in that in the absence of a specific power to postpone the operation of an order it must run from the date of the order. There is no general inherent power to suspend it. If the clause is amended in the way that the hon. and learned Gentleman suggested, there will be a lack of accord with Section 188, and there could be confusing consequences in the light of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether we ought to have another look at the implications of Section 188 is a wider question. I entirely agree that we should do that. I think it is necessary, however, that the two provisions should run in concert, otherwise we shall have considerable practical difficulty. If it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1158">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>377</span>
comes to a question of wider consideration of the issue, it falls within the ambit of the review which is being undertaken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That argument runs thus: The two should run in concert and therefore if one is bad, so should the other be bad. If there are points leading to litigation under one, we should make the second one in such a form as to ensure that they arise under that, too. It is a duff argument—at least that is what it is called in my part of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understood the Minister to say that he means this to say that an order may he made commencing at the date of the order and not
	<br><blockquote><p>"for such period not exceeding five years".</p></blockquote>
I think that is what he intends this subsection to mean. Does he agree?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he does agree, why on earth not say so? That is exactly what this amendment would do, instead of leaving it for someone to say " What does it mean? Oh, well, in its present wording it is the same as Section 188, so let us look at Section 188." In Section 188 in Halsbury's Laws we find all of the cases that have been prayed in aid on that section. From those cases we find Bradley and many others—I have been given the names of them. I am quite unmoved by Bradley's case.

Is that the way we want lawyers—it would be quite impossible for laymen to do it—to have to advise their clients about what it means? Would it not be better to say, for once, what 	<i>we</i> mean in the statute so that a layman could read it and see what he was up against, so that a director could read it, so that the company secretary could read it to his directors and tell them what they were liable for? It really is duff.

and not exceeding five years" as is specified in the order, for Heaven's sake, let us say so. All that the Minister has to do—and he will be doing himself and the Committee a favour by saving time as well as doing a favour to all those concerned with this legislation—is to accept the amendment. Again, I urge him to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point has not been answered. I have asked the Minister two questions. If he does not intend to reply to one, cannot the Law Officer reply to the other? Do the Government intend these provisions to mean what they would clearly say if this provision was amended? That is the question to which I should like an answer from the Minister. Do they intend the provisions which they have dealt with to mean what they would say if the amendment was made? If the answer is "yes", would the Solicitor-General not agree that, if that is what they are intended to mean, it is a good thing to say so—and in simple words that permit of no argument whatever? I should like an answer to both questions, either from the Minister on both or from the Minister on one question and the Solicitor-General on the other. n default of any reply from the Minister, perhaps the Solicitor-General would care to say something. This is not a difficult specific point requiring time for consideration. Does he not agree that in a statute it is a very good thing to say what one means, and that if we mean what this amendment would provide we should adopt it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I do not think that it would be wise to have a situation where, in very similar circumstances, Section 188 and this provision were not to accord. I do not accept the argument that Section 188 is necessarily defective, as the hon. and learned Gentleman said. There was a good deal of confusion in his presentation of the point originally. It may be that he had not necessarily comprehended the point being put to him by the outside bodies on this matter but if
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1159">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>379</span>
he was arguing that Section 188 was wrong in principle, his point might be valid if there was a date other than that of the order. If that was the point. then. as I have already said, I am perfectly prepared to consider that matter subsequently and determine the issue in the appropriate way. I do not believe that this is the appropriate time to do that. Having said that, I have nothing to add to the argument nor, I would think, has the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary is not being helpful this morning. The point made by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) is clear. It is that the Government say that they believe that this subsection means something. Our view is that its intention is not stated with sufficient clarity and we suggest that it is amended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Under-Secretary's argument is that this has all been clarified by case law in connection with another piece of legislation with somewhat similar drafting, all well and good. But that is no reason why we should not write it into this legislation now to consolidate—not in the technical but in the ordinary sense—what has been decided in the courts with regard to the interpretation of the other clauses. The Under-Secretary has advanced no argument to the contrary on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be—perhaps I am being oversubtle here—that what he is worried about is that if we amend the clause in this way so that the matter is made absolutely clear, though totally consistent with existing case law, it may have some peculiar repercussions on Section 188 because this clause will be worded one way and that clause will be worded in another way, even though the matter has been clearly decided in the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is what is worrying him we would understand it and, in normal circumstances, I should have been rather inclined to accept the argument. But the circumstances are not normal because we have a Companies (No. 2) Bill which has had a Second Reading and is about to go into Committee when this Bill is concluded. If that is worrying the Minister he could amend the Companies Bill, Secteion 188, in precisely the same way to consolidate what all the case law has actually decided anyway. I cannot see that that argument runs and I can see no reason why the Minister should not
	<span class='label label-info column'>380</span>
simply accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is not an attempt to improve the drafting of the Government's proposal. It is a simple proposal which suggests that greater notice should be given. Clause 7 (2)(iii) is concerned with the position where the Official Receiver or the Secretary of State intend to make an application under this subsection in respect of any person and the amount of notice that he should be given. It is suggested that he should be given 10 days' notice of an intention to hold the hearing for the application.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman's</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>attention having been called to the fact that seven Members were not present, she suspended the proceedings; and another Member having come into the Room. and seven Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no limit to the co-operation of the Opposition with the Government on this issue! I was saying that the point at issue here is how much notice should be given. It seems to me that our amendment is unbelievably moderate. I should have thought 21 days' notice is extremely tight and that it would be more appropriate if, perhaps, several months' notice should be given because the person concerned may require to do a considerable amount of research and prepare himself for the ordeal, for such it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1160">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>381</span>
would be, to make a reasonable case. But 10 days' notice seems far too short and I hope the Minister will agree to 21 days' notice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The provisions of the subsection, including the requirement of 10 days' notice of intention—I stress that it is a notice of intention—be given to any person against whom it is intended to apply for a disqualification order, are similar to those which apply under Section 188 where there is an application in the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The procedure to be followed in connection with an application to the court under Section 188 is laid down in Rule 68 of the Companies Winding-up Rules 1949 and it is intended to amend this rule so that it will also apply to applications under this clause. It may be helpful if I were to outline to the Committee the nature of Rule 68 and how it operates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This provides for applications in the High Court to be made by summons which must be served on the person against whom an order is sought not less than eight days before the hearing of the summons. In the High Court the summons is returnable in the first instance to Chambers and the court may then give directions concerning points of claim, defence and evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Additional to the 10 days' notice provided for under Clause 7(3), the respondent will therefore have a further eight days following service of the summons and such additional time as the court may allow, following directions, in which to prepare his case. Applications in the county court are made by motion of the court and a similar procedure in respect of such a motion, including eight days' notice, is laid down in Rule 69 of the winding-up rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is submitted, therefore, that a respondent has sufficient time to deal with these matters—it does not suddenly descend upon him. He has much longer than the 10 days which the hon. Gentleman suggested. In those circumstances it would be wrong to prolong this period of time as suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not wholly convinced that the difference between 10 and 21 days with regard to the courts, as against individual concern, would make a
	<span class='label label-info column'>382</span>
great deal of difference. But in the light of what the Under-Secretary has said, we would wish to consider these points, take advice, and if necessary, return to this matter on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a simple amendment. As the clause now stands it is, rather widely drafted. On page 7, subsection (6), suggests that the Secretary of State may require the liquidator or former liquidator of any company to furnish him with such information on the company's affairs, books and so on. We think it should read "the company", thereby restricting it to the company in question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am a little confused. I apologise to the Committee. I called Amendment No. 61. Amendment No. 37 was not moved. We are now on Amendment No. 61.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am so sorry. In that case I shall withdraw what I have just said. We can no doubt return to that amendment on Report. I hope the filing system for deciding what is called on Report will be adequate to cope with that and no doubt we will wish to discuss this with the others selected but not so far debated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 61, in page 7, line 19, after "IX ", insert " and Part X".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of this is to amend subsection (7) to say what is included in the way of companies. At present, there is a special provision in lines 18 and 19 saying that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'company' includes an unregistered company within the meaning of Part IX of the Companies Act 1948".</p></blockquote>
As I understand it, it is not clear whether foreign companies trading in England are covered. The Under-Secretary would probably say that, approaching this as a matter of principle, all companies trading in this country should be covered by it. The purpose of this amendment is to clarify whether foreign countries trading in England, are covered.

I think the Under-Secretary knows that this amendment came from the Law Society. It has been considered with his officials and it would be a waste of time if I were to enlarge upon that preliminary introduction. All I need say is that we would welcome his observations—unless he intends to accept it—on why it should not be accepted. It seems to us that it can do nothing but good..</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Suffice it to say, unless I am pressed to enlarge upon the matter, that I would want to discuss this further with the Working Party. In those circumstances perhaps the hon. and learned Gentleman would feel it appropriate to withdraw the amendment.

	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purpose of this section the commencement of the winding up of a company shall have the meaning contained in section 229 of the Companies Act 1948".</p></blockquote>
There is a certain irony about this because a little while ago the Minister rejected one of our amendments saying that we could not have different wording in two Acts dealing with the same thing. He said we should not carry the amendment which I was proposing, the sole objective of which was to say in terms what was meant, because then it would he different from a similar provision in another Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Government are doing in subsection (7) of Clause 7 is introducing a special definition of what is meant by "when a company is wound up" when there is already in existence in another Act of Parliament a perfectly good definition of the commencement of the winding-up. What this amendment would do would be to substitute for the special definition which is contained in subsection (7) the definition which is already contained in legislation in Section 229 of The Companies Act 1948, importing with it—and here I am adopting the Minister's argument on the previous amendment—any decisions which have already been
	<span class='label label-info column'>384</span>
made as to any doubts that there might be on the wording of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He must not turn that back against me because my previous amendment was not to overturn any of those decisions or to introduce any more doubts. It was to give effect to those decisions and to remove any possible doubt. What he is doing here is introducing a new definition when there already is one, which so far as I know has stood the test of time perfectly well. That will result in some interesting pieces of litigation. I invite the Under-Secretary to try to read his own definition with subsection (1)(a)(ii). Does it mean that one counts the five years from the making of the winding-up order or the date of the passing of the resolution for voluntary winding-up? If so, how does that work when one is considering whether a company has been wound up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I wonder if I may intervene. This is a matter which should fall, together with Amendment No. 58, within the area of discussion by the Working Party. Having said that, I hope the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I go this far with the Minister. I am glad that he has intervened and I shall try to respond in the spirit of that intervention. If he is going so far as to say that he is already convinced that the situation is not satisfactory and therefore it must be improved, I shall leave the matter there and ask leave to withdraw the amendment. But if he is simply saying that it is a matter that he wants to discuss further, I think the Committee ought to hear a little more about the ambiguities that exist. Putting that in a slightly different way, if the Minister is saying "Yes, I accept that there are ambiguities in these provisions which must be resolved, and we will come back to resolving them" that is all right. But if he is stopping short of that I think the Committee ought to hear what the ambiguities are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

this Committee simply to say " Let the Minister go on having discussions with outside bodies and we will come hack to it". If every time he says " I accept this. There is something to be put right here and I should like to discuss it with people. I will bring back the means of putting it right " he will find that we will respond immediately. But let him be perfectly clear—and we are getting to a very advanced stage of the Bill—that we are not content to say " We want more time to discuss it". I do not think that I need to enlarge upon the ambiguities. I think I have said enough to show that there is plainly ambiguity. What we should like to hear is what the Minister says this definition means. Let him answer the one question which I have postulated. We can see where we get to after that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I do not want to prolong these proceedings unnecessarily. This is a matter which we disposed of, in principle, earlier by saying that we would go on to discuss it if necessary at a later stage. I do not think the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) was entirely happy with the way that I put it but in the final analysis he accepted it. I do not wholly agree with the points which have been made by the Working Party but it may be that I am wrong about it and therefore I want to maintain an open mind on the matter. I think it is appropriate now for my officials to discuss the situation with the Working Party. If it can be established—and we are all anxious to achieve the same result here—that there is ambiguity, of course we shall be perfectly happy to introduce an appropriate amendment. I think that is a perfectly fair way of putting the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I say that we have all, throughout the proceedings of the Bill, because it is so technical and complex, been taking advice from outside bodies. I think we must be careful to avoid the danger involved if this goes too far. It is important in this Committee that the hon.

Neither must we get into a position where everything is de-
	<span class='label label-info column'>386</span>
ferred to Report stage. We want to improve the Bill as much as possible at this stage. If the arguments are spelt out, hon. Members on both sides of the Committee ought to be able to reach a decision on many of them. No doubt some of them are so technical that outside consideration is required. But we must not get into the habit of saying everything can be deferred until Report and left to outside discussions without spelling out what the arguments are so that they can be weighed in this Committee. It is only if they are examined here that we can find some of the faults in the drafting which undoubtedly exist and seek to determine to what extent the drafting is obscure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope to hear from the Minister first because I do not want to insist upon pointing out a little more specifically some of the difficulties of which I thought he might already be aware. I do not know what the Working Party has told his officials are the difficulties. I know it thinks that there are difficulties. What I am saying now is simply on my own reading of the Bill. If the Minister would be good enough to look at the provisions which we seek to amend they read thus:
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purpose of subsection (i)(a)(ii) above the winding up of a company shall be taken to occur, if it is wound up by the court, on the date of the winding up order and, in any other case. on the date of the passing pf the resolution for voluntary winding up."</p></blockquote>
What does it mean about a winding up occurring? There are three stages to winding up. There is the commencement of it, the progress of it, and the conclusion of it. I do not know what the word " occurs " means in this context. If in subsection (i) (a)(ii), one found the word " occurs ", one might then say, " Yes, this is all a question of special language, and ' occurs' means what it is planned to mean." But that is not where it appears. So what does " occur " mean? Does it mean " commence ", and, if so, why has somebody not said " commence"? Is it because that would introduce another definition of commencement of a winding up when we already have one? Have we now another definition which is a definition when a bankruptcy has occurred?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to try to relate that to the wording of the paragraph for which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1163">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>387</span>
purpose it is to be introduced into the legislation. That paragraph says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"is or has been a director of another insolvent company which is being wound up or which has been wound up within five years of the winding up of the first-mentioned company".</p></blockquote>
The word "occur" does not appear there. What are we talking about? Is the five-year period in subparagraph (ii) to be taken as commencing from the date when the winding up order is made? Or is it from the date of the passing of the resolution for voluntary winding up? Of is to be taken—which might be more logical—from the date when the winding up was completed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be observed that we are talking about the situation of a company which has been wound up. Even in the case of a company which has been wound up, are we, as the result of subsection (7), for the purposes of calculating the five years, to go back to the beginning of that winding up, although the whole of the winding up was concluded?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are just a few of the difficulties and problems which arise simply by holding the Bill in one hand and reading it. Has the Minister given any consideration to those or any other difficulties arising from these provisions, and, if so, will he give us some indication of his thinking about them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: have already indicated that this met with acquiescence from the Opposition on a previous occasion. These are technical points which fall into the category defined by the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) as those which are appropriate for discussion among those who are professionally involved in this sort of business. I will deal with the point the hon. and learned Gentleman raised in a moment. But it cannot be satisfactorily resolved in this Committee at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Opposition were prepared to deal with the matter in the way I indicated previously, I would have invited them to do so in this matter as well—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I explain to the Minister what I am saying? If he is accept-in that there is something to be resolved and the Bill will not be left as it is, we will go along with him. We will give every opportunity to co-operate in trying to improve it. All he has to do is assure us that he recognises that this will not
	<span class='label label-info column'>388</span>
do, and then we will agre that the sensible thing is to allow time for the correct answer to be found.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not absolutely convinced that this drafting will not do. What I am saying is that I want my officials and those outside to explore whether in fact this is an adequate way of dealing with the matter. That being the case, I would have thought it would—by reason of rehearsing a very technical argument—only delay consideration by this Committee of other important matters. I am not saying this is not important. Of course, it is. But I do not think we shall add to the wisdom of the Committee if we have a long technical argument which will considerably delay the Committee and possibly meet with a response from the hon. and learned Gentleman, but about which at the end of the day we shall not be able to make a definitive determination. That is what I think is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a matter about which I am now prepared to say I shall rigidly apply the words that appear in the Bill. I am not saying that. I am saying that it is a technical matter which needs to be dealt with very carefully in some considerable detail by experts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, I ask the Opposition to respond to the invitation which I made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I think the Under-Secretary still has not really taken the point. We accept fully that in some of these matters it is appropriate that consultations should take place with outside bodies. It is also very important that the Opposition—indeed, back-bench Members on both sides of the Committee—should also have an opportunity of having consultations with outside bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a satisfactory situation, when an amendment is put down, for a Minister to say, first, he is not sure there is anything wrong with it; and second, he will inquire to see whether there is, without spelling out the arguments, because the Committee and others who will be concerned with the matter on Report have no knowledge of what the arguments are, and are therefore in a much less satisfactory position regarding outside consultations than is the Minister. If he spells out the arguments, no matter how rapidly—we do not mind how quickly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1164">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>389</span>
he reads from a technical brief—we shall then know what they are. We can take them to outside bodies and ask whether they consider them to be satisfactory. But without that, we have no more basis for consultation than we did before the whole proceedings started.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think, therefore, that it is important that we do not get into the habit of saying " The matter is all right. We have discussed it outside. The Government will know what they are doing, even if no one else does."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having sat on this Committee for some time, and, given the number of Government amendments, I am very doubtful whether the Government know what they are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have on page 7, in line 23, a paragraph which seeks to set out when a particular event takes place and for what purpose. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… for the purposes of subsection (i)(a)(ii) above the winding up of a company shall be taken to occur, if it is wound up by the court, on the date of the winding up order…"</p></blockquote>
There it sets out a definition. My hon.". and learned Friend has suggested that it would be more satisfactory to say that for the same purposes
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the commencement of the winding up of a company shall have the meaning contained in Section 229 of the Companies Act 1948."</p></blockquote>
I ask the Minister this simple question. Is the clause in the Bill, as drafted, intended to have the same effect as the definition in Section 229 of the Companies Act 1948? n other words, is the Minister starting off with a completely new definition, or is it the definition which is normally used? If it is not the one which is normally used, why does not he accept the amendment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it would be helpful if the Minister clarified that point and spelt out the reasons why he feels it necessary not to use the Section 229 definition, but the one which has been imported into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difficulty we are in here is that, in a sense, Amendments Nos. 58 and 62 hang together. We have already taken a course of action in relation to Amendment No. 58, but if I am being invited to refer once again to the situation which arises there, I apolo-
	<span class='label label-info column'>390</span>
gise at once if I am at risk of being out of order. No doubt, Mrs. Jeger, you will correct me if I am.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Jeger. The problem is that I do not have Amendment No. 58? I may have the report on the debate on Amendment No. 58, but I have not the actual amendment to hand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman. Column 337 of the report of our proceedings of 8th June quotes the text of the amendment, which I understand was withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged, Mrs. Jeger.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems that the hon. Gentleman has not applied his mind to the situation. It is most unfortunate. We have taken a particular course in relation to Amendment No. 58. I am now invited in two matters which hang together for the purpose of our discussions to rehearse the arguments again about Amendment No. 58. That is a most unsatisfactory position. I do not think there is any satisfactory way of applying shorthand to a difficult matter of this kind, however the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) may approach the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I, as the mover of the amendment, comment on that? I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not say a word about Amendment No. 58. He has said everything that could be said about it. He can answer my point without saying a word about it, and I hope that he will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think it will help progress if we have the repetition of arguments made on another amendment which is not strictly comparable and which was withdrawn. I hope that we can keep to the amendment before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the Bill, the dates of the winding up orders or resolution for voluntary winding up of each company have to fall within five-year period. I am not going into any argument on Amendment No. 58, but I must just say one word about it. It substitutes the date of commencement for the winding up
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1165">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>391</span>
defined by Section 229(2) of the Companies Act 1948, applied here by Amendment No. 62, for the date of the winding up order in a compulsory liquidation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Section 229(2), a compulsory winding up is deemed to commence at the presentation of the petition for the winding up unless there is a prior resolution for a voluntary winding up. The date of commencement is related back to the presentation of the petition to prevent dispositions of company property before the winding up order is made. There is no particular significance as regards the date of the winding-up order in the context of an application for a disqualification order, except perhaps to provide a somewhat longer period during which a director may potentially be the subject of an application for disqualification if—and we come back to Amendment No. 58—the remaining part of Amendment No. 58 were to be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It follows from this that the two matters hang together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Jeger. With great respect, the hon. Member said that I had not done my homework on that. I do not think it is true. I had not related Amendment No. 58 to the amendment we are now discussing. I do not think that it has anything significant to do with it. We are perfectly able to debate this amendment without reference to Amendment No. 58. Had it been relevant, I am sure that you, Mrs. Jeger, or Mr. English, would have grouped it accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. The reason those amendments were not grouped together was that, in the view of the Chair, they did not hang together. I must ask the Minister to stick to Amendment No. 62.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have stuck to it, and I have nothing to add.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to pursue the matter, but, with great respect, I asked the Minister a simple question. I asked whether the definition in the subsection which we are seeking to amend was the same as that in Section 229. We have had no response from the Minister on that point, and I do not know whether he has considered it. He must know whether the definition is the same and, if
	<span class='label label-info column'>392</span>
it is not, why it is a different definition from that in existing legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment pro-posed—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do hope, Mrs. Jeger, that we can have a simple answer to a simple question—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If no hon. Member rises to his feet, the Chair has no option but to put the Question, and I am—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then I am rising to my feet, if I may be allowed to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ioan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Jeger. I think that you had put the Question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was in the midst of putting the Question and, as I am of a friendly, generous nature, I shall give the benefit of the doubt to the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have raised a simple question and asked the Minister to reply. In order to prepare adequately for Report stage, it will be helpful to know the answer to that question. I must assume that the Minister knows whether the definition in lines 23 to 27 on page 7 are or are not the same as the definition contained in my hon. and learned Friend's amendment. It seems to me to be an eminently sensible and an entirely relevant question to ask. I believe that the right and proper course is for the Minister to give us the simple answer so that we have a basis for proceeding. I must say to the Minister that it is appropriate that he should do that. We on this side of the Committee have been unbelievably tolerant, if I may say so, in dealing with a number of very complex amendments which have been withdrawn and then put down by the Government, and the whole matter has been inefficiently handled by the Government in respect of the initial lack of consultation in the drafting of the Bill and as regards the way in which amendments have been put down. I have not pressed the point previously, because we are anxious to make progress and to improve the legislation. But it is very
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1166">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>393</span>
important, if we ask a sensible question, that we should have a straightforward answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In order to give the Minister time to reflect upon that, may I try to help clarify what has been said in this way? The Minister says that Amendment No. 58 and this amendment hang together. I think his error is that, if Amendment No. 58 had been passed, then the point would be quite different. But, the amendment was withdrawn and subsection (1) remains as it was. Subsection (7) is dealing with a definition in the Bill for the purpose of ascertaining what is meant by subsection (1) as it now stands. The Minister seemed to be reading from a note in which these two matters were combined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that will help and that the Minister can clarify his mind on that point. Having said that, can we really not have the answer for which my hon. Friend has asked? In fact, I know the answer to the first part of the question: the definition in subsection (7) is not the same as in Section 229. That leads to the second part of the question and is " Why not?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the thinking behind this drafting which has led to the inclusion for the purposes of this one subparagraph—because the definition only relates to one subparagraph--of subsection (1) of the clause? Why do the Government say that we should have a special definition for the purposes of that one subparagraph? Secondly, cannot the Minister bring himself to answer the question which is troubling a good many people? Having decided to introduce a special definition, what on earth does that definition mean?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: J said specifically when I last spoke on this matter that the definition was not the same. The hon. and learned Gentleman could not have followed what I was saying. The second point I made was that the circumstances to which the two matters related were different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. and learned Member will examine the record at the next sitting, he will find precisely what I have said. I have in no way been disrespectful to the Committee. I have spelled out the position.
	<span class='label label-info column'>394</span>
I was seeking to enable us to proceed further with the discussions which must inevitably go on with people outside, notwithstanding the fact that I responded to the hon. and learned Gentleman. The result is the same, because I have added nothing to the position as it was at the beginning and the hon. and learned Gentleman has added nothing. We have not been able to make progress precisely because this matter is a technical matter which requires the very sort of consideration which Opposition Members themselves agree should have been made under Amendment No. 58.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee for more than a moment. These are technical matters. None the less, it is the duty of the Committee to deal with technical matters and it is important that the arguments on both sides of the Committee should be spelled out to the best of our ability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened with interest to what the Minister has just said. It is not my recollection that he spelled out the differing circumstances which require the definition in this case not to be the same as in Section 229. Nor is it my recollection that he adduced arguments why the definition in Section 229 is unsatisfactory at this point in the Bill. But in view of what he said, I shall, of course, carefully study the 	<i>Official Report</i> before the next sitting, and no doubt the Minister will do the same. If it turns out that the point he has made is not correct, no doubt we can revert to it later or perhaps raise it on a point of order so that the Minister may have an opportunity at some other stage—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not advise the hon. Member to make any such presumption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps not, but at all events we shall look carefully at the record and see to what extent the Minister is correct in what he says. No doubt he will wish to take whatever steps are necessary to put the matter right. Perhaps I might go so far as to say that. We are anxious to make progress, and I think that my hon. and learned Friend probably wishes to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Before I ask leave to withdraw the amendment, I should like
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1167">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>395</span>
to say that, yes, of course it is useful for these matters to be explored with outside bodies. I regret the situation which has arisen on this amendment, as I think it is also important that these matters should be explored in, and by, the Committee. It is apparent, however, that that will not happen and, rather than waste time arguing whether it should or should not be, I am prepared to accept that it will not happen. Perhaps the Minister will let us have a copy of the case which he would have read out, had he thought it useful for the matter to be gone into here, because as my hon. Friend said we also could take advice on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subject to that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed. That the clause stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher-Cooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been puzzled for some time why this clause is in the Bill. The rest of the Bill deals with bankruptcy and throughout our statute law, bankruptcy and company law are dealt with by separate statutes—for at least the past hundred years. It seems bad legislation to put in a Bill that deals otherwise entirely with bankruptcy, a clause that deals with company law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand the political driving force that requires the Government to take the first opportunity they can to stop what, certainly in company law, has been an abuse; namely, the actions of certain directors, the names of whom are sometimes household words, who have—not necessarily by fraud, but possibly only by gross negligence—defrauded or deprived either their shareholders or the public of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rules relating to the responsibility of directors should be tightened up. I do not think anybody would disagree with that. In the Companies Bill which the late Conservative administration had on the stocks at the time of its unfortunate demise, that was being done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is a Companies Bill on the stocks in this administration—or there was, and I suppose there still is—which we were told about by the Under-Secretary and which would follow immediately in this Committee upon the conclusion of its deliberations on bankruptcy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>396</span>
I should like to ask why this clause, which deals with directors and their responsibilities and the defalcations and pains and penalties they will and should suffer, cannot be included in a Companies Bill where all the other pains and penalties of directors, and their duties, are set out, and where the definitions of matters like windings up, as canvassed in the previous debate on the last amendment, are already included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be very difficult for practitioners in company law to be constantly alerted to the fact that the code in the various Companies Acts is incomplete, because they will have to look also at a Bill which is not a Companies Bill, but which is really a bankruptcy Bill with one clause that sticks out like a sore thumb. I am not saying that it is against the Short Title or the Long Title; that has been carefully drawn by the unexpected words " insolvency " and " bankruptcy ", obviously for the purpose of seeing that Clause 7 is within the Title.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it does not seem to me very good, nor a very good following of the recommendations of the Benson Committee, that bits and pieces of company law should be dotted about in Acts that are not Companies Acts. I have sympathy with the Government. They want to get this provision in as quickly as possible, because the law relating to the duties and shortcomings of directors is not satisfactory. But since they have a Companies Bill coming along, why could it not have been put into that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may make one or two points. The first arises immediately out of what my hon. and learned Friend has just said. I think I am right in saying that the Government intend that there shall be a register of those disqualified and that that will appear in the companies legislation which they are proposing. Perhaps the Under-Secretary could confirm whether or not that is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it seems extremely odd that some of the means by which people are disqualified are set out in the Bill, but that the register of whether they are disqualified or not is set out in another Bill. I am not clear how we might best set about overcoming the difficulties which my hon. and learned Friend has just raised. But, on the face of it, it seems desirable that they shall be in the same section, rather than spread around.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1168">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>397</span>
I suppose it would be possible for the Companies Bill to translate this clause from this Bill to that Bill. But perhaps the Under-Secretary could give us his views on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed a number of the aspects of this clause so far. One thing abundantly clear is that the present drafting is extraordinarily obscure and open to a considerable amount of doubt, and a great deal of work obviously has to be done between now and Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were talking earlier about the effects of retrospection and that the fact that the penalties in the general, not the legal, sense, imposed on people who fell within the scope of this clause were very severe. On reading through it vet again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find that that they are rather more severe than I had realised, because, if someone is caught retrospectively by these provisions, and if they are not amended as we have suggested they should be on Report, the person is not merely disqualified from being a director. He may not be a director in any way, either directly or indirectly, or be concerned with or take part in the management of a company for the given period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So it is not only his livelihood as director which is being put at stake retrospectively if we do not amend the clause. It is his ability to take part in the management of any company in any way. directly or indirectly. I am not clear, other than going, into the public service in some way, how he is, under these circumstances of being disqualified, to earn a living.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably he can go into public service, but I think that brings out the strength of the argument that we have in no way exaggerated the peril in which such people may find themselves if we do not amend the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point reinforces the one that I have just made. We were talking earlier about whether the House ever passed legislation which had the effect of making people criminals retrospectively. At second hand, there is some danger that this is so in the clause, since it may be that, as a result of something done in the past, though not an offence, a person finds himself subject to these penalties. If, as a result of that having happened, he contravenes the order, he could, in fact, find himself in prison. All of this would be as a result of something he did in the past, which was in no way an offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>398</span>
I do hope that the Under-Secretary will consider my point that the retrospective element of the clause is highly objectionable. I do not wish to delay the Committee further, other than to make those two points, particularly the one made by my hon. and learned Friend on, so to speak, an institutional or mechanical aspect of the matter, to which I hope the Under-Secretary will reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: n response to the hon. and learned Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke), I ought to say that this is, of course, an insolvency Bill, not simply a bankruptcy Bill. It relates necessarily, therefore, to the activities of companies, and it was our choice that these provisions should come into the Bill—they were obviously relevant to the Bill—and one can never be quite sure in a parliamentary session whether the other legislation will be finally enacted. We are not sure whether this will be, of course, but we hope so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At all events, it was by no means irrelevant to the purposes of the Bill—indeed, it was highly germane that one should deal in windings up with some of the penalties that will fall upon those responsible for the management and control of companies that are wound up. We thought it was highly appropriate, therefore, that Clause 7 should be included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also an element of urgency about this matter. The hon. and learned Gentleman conceded that and said that, as a matter of principle, he was not against its inclusion but that he thought that it was not necessarily the right vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before leaving that point altogether I should say that there are a substantial number of other provisions in the Bill which relate to companies which might conceivably figure in a Companies Bill. Clauses 1 and 3 relate to companies as well. However, I do not want to labour that point, because I have made the major point in relation to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the observations of the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins), it is much wider than simply dealing with company directors who would be disqualified under the provisions of Clause 7. I give the undertaking that this is to appear in the Companies (No. 2) Bill at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>399</span>
the appropriate stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lion. Gentleman went on to argue one aspect of the retrospective element which was dealt with most convincingly by my hon. and noble Friend, the Lord Chancellor in another place when he said, during Second Reading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In practice the court has taken the view that for the purposes of Section 188—and the same will apply here—a person is concerned or takes part in the management of a com-pany where he is performing duties consistent with those of a director; that is to say, where he is taking a leading part in the company's overall management. On the other hand, a person who is merely managing a part of the company's activities, for example, a sales man- ager, would not be concerned or taking part in the management of the company within the meaning of Section 188, nor indeed of Clause 7 of the Bill. The effects of the clause therefore are not to deprive a person from earning his living but to deprive him from acting in connection with a company in an overall managerial capacity."—(Official 	<i>Report, House of Lords;</i> 4th December 1975, Vol. 366, c. 783.)</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case, it is an extraordinary state of affairs. This subsection clearly sets out the position and could not be more explicit. should have thought that it would have over- ridden any previous precedents to a con- tray effect. It says
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall not, without the leave of the court. be a director of or in any way, whether directly or indirectly".</p></blockquote>
It does not say
	<br><blockquote><p>"but not if he is only partially concerned or taking part in the management of a company".</p></blockquote>
The argument that that does not apply to someone who is only managing part of a company—there are few people managing the whole of any company—means that it would apply to anyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the argument is that the existing law elsewhere and the case law means that the clause means not what it says but something totally different. we have arrived at a strange position in drafting Bills in this House of Commons. I hope the Minister will clear up whether that is so. There is no reference to whether it is " partially". It says
	<br><blockquote><p>"in any way, whether directly or indirectly".</p></blockquote>
That seems clear enough, and I cannot believe that what the hon. Member has just said is true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether that was a speech or an inter-
	<span class='label label-info column'>400</span>
vention. It was a long intervention based upon astonishment. But the situation is exactly as I have spelled it out—that it is applying exactly the same reasoning as was applied in Section 188 of the Companies Act 1948.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the wording the same?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is consistent with the position, as I understand it. I have not had an opportunity this morning to look through the section itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may give the hon. Gentleman an opportunity to sort out the position. As a layman, I find it an extraordinary statement. Perhaps the Minister could refer to the appropriate part of Section 188 and tell us whether it is identical, or it might be more convenient for the Committee if he were to read it out so that we could check it against the Bill. I appreciate that he must find the appropriate section, but surely it is relevant. If what he is saying is true, we must be quite sure whether Section 188 is identical. We shall not have an opportunity to consider it later, as I understand it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentle: man had as much opportunity as I to look this up. It appears in Section 188 (1)(b)
	<br><blockquote><p>"the court may make an order that that person shall not, without the leave of the court. he a director of or in any way, whether directly or indirectly, be concerned or take part in the management of a company for such period not exceeding five years as may be specified in the order."</p></blockquote>
What the Lord Chanccllor was saying is absolutely on all fours with that, and I accept his argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chainman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister finished? I am about to put the Question, That Clause 7 stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mrs. Jeger.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As .I understand the Minister, lie is arguing that the wording in Section 188 is precisely the same as the wording in line 13. Therefore, the previous case law, which is interpreted in Section 188, would, I presume. be immediately applied to this clause. That is essentially his argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>401</span>
I confess that I would be astonished if the courts found that anyone who was only partially concerned with the affairs was not covered by the expression
directly or indirectly " or concerned in any way. It seems to be a very strange way for the courts to interpret the matter. but no doubt I shall remain astonished for the moment and I shall consult my hon. and learned Friends to determine whether that is a satisfactory state of affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, as with the previous points that have been raised, if the case law has clearly altered the situation as far as the existing law is concerned—and given that the Companies (No. 2) Bill may get through this session and, therefore, that any repercussions from altering this Bill on existing legislation can be overcome—I should have thought it very desirable, if the courts have interpreted this clause in a way which ordinary mortals would not interpret it, to alter both this wording and that in existing legislation so that we know what we are talking about. I cannot conceive that this wording means what the hon. Gentleman has suggested, and we shall need to consider the matter very carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very surprised at what I understood the Minister to say. He appeared to be saying—and I have to put it this way because it was not until he reached the end that the penny dropped—that in fact an order does not make all that much difference to a company director but that he can play a very large part in the running of a company—I steer clear of the word " management "—and thus earn his living. I think the inference was, to earn his living as a quite senior executive of a company. notwithstanding the fact that he has been so disqualified. I understood the Minister to say that that is his and the Government's understanding of the effect of the cases on Section 188.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that some of the words that are relevant to this argument appear in Section 188. Therefore, we must take advice on what the effect of the cases is and what a person can do, albeit disqualified. without the leave of the court. I think it very important that it should be plainly on record what the Government say a person can do in the running of a company, albeit disqualified, without the

However, I find it extraordinary that they should have been weeping copious tears for those poor unfortunate persons who were going to be caught by this terrible retrospective element of the legislation, and who were to be deprived of the opportunity of earning a living. Now they are saying that they should not be given the opportunity of earning their living.

One has not been there and is not familiar
	<span class='label label-info column'>404</span>
with the prevailing jokes. One does not know whether there is a sense of urgency, or whether the Committee is more likely to approve of brevity or careful application. Therefore, I am glad that I was able to be here earlier this morning.

Law Officers are sometimes warned not to sit through debates which are not essential to them because one penalty which they pay is that they are sometimes invited, quite properly, to awake from their normal somnolence and stamp their words into tablets of stone in situations which are not always helpful either to the Committee or to posterity. But I think that is a price worth paying, because I know at least a little now about the corporate nature of the personality of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Opposition Members will at least accept that the purpose of Amendment No. 64 is to meet some of the anxieties which they have expressed in the course of these debates. Clause 8 provides for an extension of the power of county courts to make administration orders. Briefly, for the benefit of my hon. Friends who have the advantage of not being lawyers, may I explain?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An administration order is a method of bringing together all the assets of a debtor so that, instead of each creditor taking a separate peck at the car case, we can organise the debts, make sure that everyone gets a fair deal and organise the assets so that they are available to pay other debts. That is the purpose of an administration order, and it is intended to do it in such a way that one is spared the more complicated, more severe and more expensive machinery of bankruptcy. which might be appropriate when one is dealing with much bigger debts and assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a new power in this Bill. The courts already have power to make administration orders on the application of a debtor if he is unable
	<br><blockquote><p>"forthwith to meet his liabilities ",</p></blockquote>
provided that the total of his indebtedness does not exceed £1,000. It is to deal with what we broadly refer to nowadays as " small debtors". That is the effect of Part VII of the County Courts Act 1959. amended by the Administration of Justice Act 1965.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee may think that that is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>405</span>
good sense because, where one is dealing with debtors whose total debts and total assets are in this kind of league, it does not make sense to invoke the expensive and complicated machinery of bankruptcy proceedings. That would only ensure that all the available money was swallowed up in the costs of administration and there would not be any money left over for anybody. Instead, the legislature has provided this simpler and cheaper process. It has commended itself to successive Governments of various political colours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Normally, it would be used for the kind of small debtor who has an accumulation of hire-purchase debts over a period of time because he or his wife is not very good at managing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say at once that the enthusiasm for this procedure varies from court to court, and it depends on the nature of the area, the kind of people one is likely to be dealing with, and to some extent—let us face it—the personality of the judge or registrar. One must not complain about that. One does not want a legal system administered by robots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that the Law Society's Working Party has expressed some reservations about this clause, and I am sure that one certainly not the Law Society, would accuse me of being indifferent to its real experience of these matters. It is not a complete answer to everyone's problems. Methods of enforcing debts against insolvent debtors rarely are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Member says that the Law Society has expressed reservations about the clause. Is not it true that it is not in favour of it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman wants to put it in that stark language-[appreciate his passion for draftsmanship—the Law Society has done two things. First, it said it did not like the clause, and second, it said that if we were to have it there should be certain improvements. I tried to bring all those things together by saying that it expressed reservations. Let us not spend a lot of time on the semantics of the matter. That is the position, and the hon. Gentleman's
	<span class='label label-info column'>406</span>
is quite right. I am sure he would not accuse me of being indifferent normally to the representations of the Law Society. If he were to accuse me of that, perhaps he would like to ask the President of the Law Society or members of the Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for his frank admission. Of course, I do not say he is indifferent to the opinions of the Law Society. But is it not its view that there is no advantage in including the clause in the Bill and it should be omitted? is not that the true case? Is not that a little stronger than saying it has reservations about it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will desist from making my speech for me, perhaps we can deal with that matter when we get there. That is what the Law Society said. If it makes him happy, that is precisely what it said. If he likes, I will read it out but I do have one eye on the clock and I imagine that, although the Committee has not too much sense of urgency, it probably would not welcome this kind of altercation at great length.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that this procedure is not a complete answer to everyone's problems. I do not think there is any procedure which is a complete answer for dealing with the debts of insolvent debtors. There has not been a machine devised which is admirably adapted for extracting blood from stones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This method is the best that can be adapted in certain situations. It has to be assessed against the background of the alternatives. I should not have thought there was any harm in giving the court an additional power which it might use when it thought it sensible to use it. But, broadly, I should be prepared to accept on this, as a fair assessment, the judgment of the Payne Committee. Referring to this procedure, the Committee said in paragraph 742 of its report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Its popularity has varied from district to district and it has met with differing success dependent upon the experience and enthusiasm of local county court officers. There can he little doubt that properly used it has met with great success and we have had many recommendations to the effect that the figure of £300 should be substantially increased "—</p></blockquote>
which of course it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not unaware of varying kinds of reactions to this procedure. Some of my
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1173">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>407</span>
best friends are judges and registrars, That is the procedure which is contained in the County Courts Act 1959 and the provisions are on the application of the debtor. If it is asked " Why should the debtor ask to have an administration order made against him? ", the answer is that he has a very real incentive because it will protect him in most circumstances, from all the other means which might be used against him of enforcing the debts, with various creditors jostling one another for position, and everyone taking a kick at him in the process—a succession of bailiffs, bankruptcy petitions, garnishee summonses, and so on. Thus, he has an incentive to apply for an order, because all his debts and all the revenues are pursued under the one proceeding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may say so, I am not normally given to looking closely at the text of what someone has said in a speech and subjecting it to a minute analysis. I am doing it here only for the purpose of giving the hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) an opportunity of telling us at a later stage whether he really did mean what he said on Second Reading, or whether it was a form of shorthand—which many of us have used on occasions—which probably telescoped a a much more complicated argument. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I believe that the choice of method of execution rests solely with the creditor."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 3rd March 1976, Vol. 906, c. 1488.]</p></blockquote>
I am sure that he did not intend that as a statement of law, because clearly it does not rest solely with the creditor. As a statement of the morality of the position, I assume that on reflection he will probably wish to phrase that a little differently, because the interests of two parties are involved—the debtor and the creditor—and there may be other parties, because there are the priorities of all the other creditors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a form of shorthand. What I was saying was that the State provides for certain methods of enforcement by judgment creditors. The morality comes in there. This House has to decide on the morality of giving this, that, or the other remedy. That is why we did away with the liability of a debtor to go to prison if he failed to pay a debt. That is where the morality comes in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saying that the State having pro-
	<span class='label label-info column'>408</span>
vided various methods of enforcement, it always lies with the judgment creditor to decide which of those to use. He may have to ask the leave of the court and he may not receive that leave of the court, but the decision about which one to try to use always lies with the judgment creditor. I believe that is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may say so, with respect to the hon. and learned Gentleman, while I am grateful to him for clarifying what he meant to say, I should not have thought that that was true even as a matter of law at the present time, because the procedure which I have described is invoked on the application of the debtor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But it is not for the enforcement of a judgment debt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, the hon. and learned Gentleman is playing with words. Given that an administration order is not for the enforcement of a judgment debt, it is a little difficult to see where it fits in to all this. It is, on any showing, one of a number of alternative methods of dealing with unpaid judgment debts. This procedure is one which has a worthy ancestry through a succession of Governments. The Act applicable was passed in 1959. It is a way of producing a method of dealing with the situation on the application of the debtor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should not have thought there was any difficulty about this. Everyone would accept, surely, that the court ought to consider the position of the debtor and the interests of the debtor together with the interests of the creditor. In certain situations, balancing the various interests involved, the court will make an order on the application of the debtor, even though the creditor opposes the application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That procedure is on the application of the debtor. But, of course, the procedure has been extended by the Attachment of Earnings Act 1971. Under that Act, the court is empowered to make an order on the application of the creditor for an attachment of earnings order. So, assuming that we are to have administration orders—and I know of no one who has seriously suggested that they should be abolished—what more is needed? The court can make an order under the County Courts Act on the application of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1174">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>409</span>
the debtor. It can make an order under the Attachment of Earnings Act on an application originating from the creditor. What more is needed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is, of course, a gap at the moment because there is no power to make an order where the creditor either does not or, in some circumstances, cannot apply for an attachment of earnings order if the debtor himself chooses not to make an application for one. Where, for example, there is a self-employed debtor, the creditor cannot apply for an attachment of earnings order. If the self-employed debtor chooses not to apply, there is no power to make the order at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause is intended to enable the court to make an order of its own volition or—and I hasten to say this—on an application by either of the parties. This is one of the purposes of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has occasioned a great deal of criticism. It has been suggested that this may be unfair to creditors because, by a procedure which does not originate with the creditor, the creditor may find himself precluded from alternative methods of enforcing his debt. I am bound to say that I find that criticism a little puzzling because the court may already make an order on the application of the debtor, even if the creditor opposes the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would be true even if the debtor were a self-employed person. Indeed, if the debtor were a self-employed person, the only way in which the court could make an order would be upon the application of the debtor. So I do not see that the creditor is losing anything which he has already. All that is happening is that the court is obtaining an additional power to deal with a situation, which arises sometimes, when it seems sensible to deal with it in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the general purpose of the clause. I hope the Committee will forgive me for saying that. Really one cannot discuss the amendments without a word, and I hope it has not been much more than a word—by lawyer's standards,
	<span class='label label-info column'>410</span>
relatively few words—about the clause in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the amendment. What it does is to substitute a complete chunk of the clause for the original draft in order to meet a number of criticisms which were levelled at the original draft, particularly by the hon. and learned Member for Southport. I hope he will not complain that his criticisms were not listened to and duly taken account of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Roughly, one can say that there are four major differences. First, some doubts were expressed about whether the court should have to have regard to the assets of the debtor before it made an order. The revised text includes the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"is unable forthwith to pay ",</p></blockquote>
which necessarily brings in his assets. If there was any doubt about the matter, these words resolve it. The court would not proceed to make an order, m rely because it had given a money judgment, without giving consideration to the assets which are available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps by way of emphasising that. there has been another change of wording. Previously, the text was that the court " shall consider " whether the case was one on which to make an order. It now reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the court is of opinion that the case may be one".</p></blockquote>
It is not a clear, stark difference, but it is one which lends some weight to the point made by the hon. and learned Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it was pointed out by the hon. and learned Gentleman and, I think, other hon. Members, that it was not clearly spelled out that the court should be able to entertain applications by parties to the proceedings and that it was only a matter for the court's own motion—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
