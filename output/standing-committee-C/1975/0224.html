	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed—(19th February)</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>No. 122, in page 19, line 11, after " a ", insert " legally qualified".—[	<i>Mr. Body.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. E. S. Bishop)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was unable at our last sitting to complete my reply to the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) about the coverage of our recovery power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 	<i>c.</i> 708 of the proceedings of our last sitting 1 reminded the Committee that there was a precedent for the situation in the Farm and Horticultural Development Regulations 1973. Indeed, we do not need to go further than Section 29 of the Agriculture Act 1970—the section which this clause amends—to find a precedent, which is what the hon. Member for Holland with Boston was asking for. We do not even need to go beyond the 1970 Act to find a precedent. This section gives the Minister the power to recover the whole of a farm capital grant where a false or misleading statement is made in connection with the initial application for approval of the proposed work. I hope that the hon. Member is following me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am. I am listening very carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to many people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I make this point because it is crucial. We already have powers in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>712</span>
1970 Act to proceed in this way in relation to the initial application. We are seeking to extend it to the other aspect where the falsity relates to the subsequent claim for payment of grant. No new principle is involved. The principle and the precedent is already before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have explained that our usual practice will be to use the power only in cases where there has been a successful prosecution for fraud or false statement. We would also use it sometimes when no prosecution had taken place if there were ample grounds for believing that falsity had occurred—for example, following an admission of the applicant. Again, in a case where a claim involving a number of items was tainted, we might not seek to prosecute in respect of all of them. If the prosecution was successful we would consider that we had a right to recover grant paid on all the items in the claim. The extent to which other items were affected would be one of the questions which the Minister would wish to be covered by the report of the appointed person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say a few words about that—it is the subject of this Amendment and Amendment No. 123. The amendments deal with the status of the inquiry to be set up when representations are made against the Minister's decision to recover grants under his various capital grant schemes where approved conditions were broken, the work badly done or the applicant had given false or misleading information. Basically, the matter to be considered at such hearings is, in the light of circumstances, the extent to which grant already paid can justifiably be recovered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The inquiry will be essentially to determine the facts of the case having regard to all the relevant agricultural considerations. Matters of law are not involved. It would therefore be inappropriate to set up a legal type inquiry, as is implicit in the amendments, especially as the " appointed person " is called on not to make a decision, but to report the facts to the Minister with, if he so wishes, a recommendation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, it seems to me that the appointment of a person to hold such an inquiry should rest with the Minister charged with the responsibility for administering all matters relating to the grant schemes involved and to whom the report will be addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0394">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>713</span>
I hope that this explanation will enable the hon. Member to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to express my sincere misgivings on this matter. Precedents have been quoted, and the Minister has given reasonably adequate grounds for his concern. Indeed, he would be an absolute fool not to take powers unto himself to make appropriate recovery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, there are echoes of disturbance in my mind. For example, will the individual appearing before the person appointed for the purpose be entitled to legal advice at those proceedings? Will the proceedings and the ensuing report be private? Will the report be available automatically to Members of Parliament or to anybody else?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to a situation where prosecution might not take place, as he had decided not to pursue the matter, but which would give him grounds to recoup the outgoings. In what sort of situation would the Minister decide not to take proceedings? If there were sufficient grounds to recoup, one would think that 	<i>prima facie</i> there would be court proceedings. If not, the Minister would appear to be illegally acquiescing in that situation and becoming part of a conspiracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I follow and accept the adjoining reason that parts of an application might come before and be taken over by the court. But the Minister also said that when no proceedings take place in court action might be taken. This is a fallback for the Minister. I am very disturbed about the situation and should be obliged if, while dealing with other points, the hon. Gentleman would comprehend and reply to that one as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Minister of State several questions. First, are his present powers such that he cannot recover grants paid without this legislation? Is it not the fact that, after someone has been convicted of obtaining money by false pretences from the Ministry, the judge may award compensation to the Minister by requiring the money to be paid back? If so, it is surely unnecessary for the Minister to seek these powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the use of the power which we seek in this clause will be confined to those cases where there has been a successful prosecution for fraud or for false statement."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee C,</i> 19th February; 	<i>c.</i> 708.]</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>714</span>
If that is so, the Minister is trying to take power away from the courts, where it should reside and has resided until now, and to do something essentially arbitrary. I use the word " arbitrary " in its true sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning the Minister seemed to make matters worse by suggesting that there might be occasions when there would be no prosecution in reclaiming money. That would be not because information received had been false, but because it had been misleading. To whom is it misleading? The test resides with the Minister. It is not a matter of fact ascertainable in a court of law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister will give this matter serious consideration. He is asking Parliament to give him power to put somebody in a quasi criminal position because he has not the guts to put that person in a criminal position. One has either sought a grant by giving false information, and is guilty of fraud, or one has not. It is one or the other—black or white. Every lawyer knows that there are no shades of grey in matters of this kind. The Minister is trying to introduce a shade of grey into the matter by saying, " If I think that the information given to me is misleading, I can get the money back from the farmer after he has received and spent it". That is a cowardly, quite apart from being an arbitrary, thing to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister owes it to the farming industry to make a clear statement of his intentions. It is no good harking back to legislation enacted in 1970. I hesitate to say anything so corny as "Two wrongs do not make a right". This is a serious matter. The fact that Parliament was not alerted to this matter earlier does not mean that it should be permanently overlooked. Parliament should not continue to give Ministers power to reclaim money on an allegation of fraud without having the matter properly settled in the one place where the rules of evidence and of procedure have been designed over many years to ensure a fair hearing and trial for those who are accused of fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is ill-fitting for the Minister to try to perpetuate a system which is inherently unfair, as this must be. He knows that a legal-type inquiry would be instituted. Those were his words. But why should we not have a legally-qualified person to preside over such an inquiry? Who will the Minister appoint to hold a legal-type inquiry? We must impose some fetter upon
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0395">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>715</span>
the Minister as to who is to be given the task of interpreting the point of view of the Minister and of the farmer who obtained the grant. The farmer may or may not have acted innocently. We must not assume that, because the Minister thinks he has some misleading information, the information comes from someone who willfully sought to deceive him. I am apprehensive about the dangerous principle that we are now introducing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State referred to the 1970 legislation. Has any other Minister sought to have this kind of power over the citizen? The Minister is proposing to give the citizen money. However, if he thinks that the information provided by the applicant is misleading, he will say that he wants the money back. The Minister proposes to treat the citizen as a criminal, but will not prosecute him because he does not want this matter to be settled by a judge and jury. He wants the case settled and decided by a man who is not legally qualified but who is appointed by him. We have heard of judges and juries in their own causes. This goes beyond even that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard an unsatisfactory explanation this morning. It was bad enough last week when the Minister said he would not use these powers without a prosecution. He has now gone further and said that these powers might well be used without a prosecution. Whichever way the Minister says it, he is wrong. If he says that the powers will be invoked only in the case of successful prosecution, I make two submissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, it is unnecessary for the Minister to seek the powers because he has them already. The judge, having heard the evidence, has the power there and then to order the money to be paid back to the Minister. Second, if the proposition is that the powers should be exercised only in the event of successful prosecution, we should fetter the Minister's hands, and take him at his word. We should insert a provision to give to the Minister the use of these powers only after a successful prosecution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning the hon. Gentleman is saying something different. He now says that he wishes to have these powers because he might want to exercise them when he is not willing to prosecute. The Minister might find the powers a cheaper and easier exercise than prosecution. He might be tempted to suggest that no one should be prosecuted, but that a farmer who had received money and spent it,
	<span class='label label-info column'>716</span>
should be told that he must repay it. The Minister could appoint someone a person not legally qualified who would decide the issue. The Minister's representative would not be the Lord Chancellor or any independent person. This is a bad principle and I suggest that the Minister does not realise how bad a principle it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our courts we have always had an objective test applied. The Minister is seeking to apply the subjective test of what is in his mind, and making that the test of guilt. It is a dangerous proposal. The Minister should return to the objective test which we have had for centuries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must admit, as a non-lawyer, that I cannot understand Clause 15. To my way of thinking it stinks. What my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) said is right. I have some experience of quasi-judicial inquiries. I do not like them. People appointed by Ministers act as judge, jury and prosecutor in their own cases. I submit that we should try to get away as far as possible from that idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister, intend the powers in the clause to be used only in cases when there has been a court hearing at which the person has been convicted of fraud? If so, I can understand that a case might arise in which the law is not sufficient and that we would need such a clause to enable the Minister to recover the money. I do not know. If the Minister assures me that that is so, and that he intends to use the powers only in cases of successful prosecution for fraud I shall be satisfied. But if, as the hon. Gentleman appeared to say, he will be able to set up an inquiry within his own Department, with someone appointed by himself to judge the case of a farmer who might have received money to which, through an error, he might not be entitled, I do not believe that that is the right thing to do. I submit that it is contrary to the law of the land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall go carefully into the matter again. When I spoke earlier I wanted to emphasise how important it was to pay attention to explanations. I do not suggest that hon. Members were not paying attention, but clearly I was not understood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that I did not make one speech last week and another today. My remarks today form the tail-end of the same speech.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0396">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>717</span>
Therefore I do not want the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) to say that I am going back on what I said. I had not reached the stage, at One o'clock last Thursday, at which I could qualify my remarks about other aspects of the provision. I make that point strongly. I am not re-thinking what I said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I revert to my earlier comments to get the background straight in the minds of hon. Members. The grant procedure operates so that an applicant for a farm capital grant has to submit two separate applications. The first seeks approval of the proposed expenditure. The second is an application for the payment of grant after the work has been carried out, and the approved expenditure incurred. There are therefore two aspects to the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to be clear that we are talking about the farm capital grant scheme and the horticultural capital grant, and that the farm and horticultural development schemes do not come within the purview of this clause. Is that the position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that point in the course of my comments, I want the Committee to turn its mind to the present situation. As I said, there are two aspects. The approval procedure for proposed expenditure gives the Minister the powers we are seeking for the second stage. Those powers were given in the Agriculture Act 1970. Section 29(4) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If at any time after the appropriate Minister has approved any expenditure for the purposes of a grant under such a scheme it appears to that Minister"</p></blockquote>
sub-section (	<i>c</i>) goes on to say, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the person by whom the application for that approval was made (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the applicant t) gave information on any matter relevant to the giving of the approval which was false or misleading in a material respect, the appropriate Minister may revoke the approval in respect of the whole or part of the expenditure and, where in pursuance of subsection (3)(a) or (	<i>b</i>) of this section any payment has been made by the Minister or the Secretary of State by way of grant, the Minister or, as the case may be, the Secretary of State may on demand recover an amount equal to that payment or such part thereof as the appropriate Minister may specify;".</p></blockquote>
The Minister has already been given powers as recently as 1970 for the initial application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All we are asking is that we should be able to extend that power to the second part of the application procedure which
	<span class='label label-info column'>718</span>
refers to the grant claimed after the work has been carried out and the approved expenditure incurred. There is nothing more outrageous than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be asked why it is necessary and some may point out that the Minister has powers to go to court. It is true that he has these powers, like every other citizen. But other citizens also have powers to recover money without going to court, if that is possible. The power is needed because without it the Minister would only have the right to seek recovery of the excess over the amount properly due. The person making a false claim could thus end up with as much grant as if the claim had been truthful. As Section 29(4) of the Agriculture Act 1970 now stands Ministers have the power to recover the whole grant only where a false or misleading statement has been made in connection with the initial application for approval of the proposed work and not where the falsity relates to the subsequent claim for payment of grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that is clear. I do not need to go through the books to find lists of precedents. There is already a precedent in the measure we are discussing and about which I presume there is no argument. The clause seeks to amend the Agriculture Act 1970 so that subparagraph (	<i>c</i>) would read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the person by whom the application for that approval or for the making of any payment was made gave information on any matter relevant to the giving of the approval or for the making of the payment which was false or misleading in a material respect."</p></blockquote>
This merely gives power to the Minister on the second part of the approval procedure as well as the first part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question was asked why the Minister should not go to court in every case. On the initial claim he does not have to do so. He already has power to recover the money by the same means as we wish to give him when the money has been paid. There may be occasions when the applicant has other money owing to him and when the Ministry does not need to go to court but can recover it from other sums available. Our usual practice will be to use the power only in cases where there has been a successful prosecution for fraud or false statement. We would wish to use it sometimes when no prosecution had taken place and where there were ample grounds for believing that falsity had occurred—for instance, where
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0397">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>719</span>
the applicant admits that he has been guilty of a false statement or fraud. There may be other cases where—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They should be prosecuted. Is that not the right course?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The health of the applicant and other aspects taken into account would make it not right to prosecute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister amplify that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I am doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer to the point when an applicant has gone through the procedure and received the money. It is clear that he is guilty, but no prosecution takes place, the Minister acquiesces and resorts to administrative procedures. My understanding was that when something criminal came to the attention even of an individual, he was duty-bound to proceed with a prosecution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was once involved in a tragic case in a company of which I was managing director. An employee stole a bar of chocolate from the canteen. Since it had been reported to the police there was no alternative but to proceed with the prosecution. It was an absurd and tragic case. I was informed at the time that I was duty-bound to proceed. Here the Minister is privy to a contravention of some greater magnitude and he has to decide how to proceed. How does he arrive at a decision and is he within the law in making that decision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be difficult to go into all the circumstances in which the Minister may decide whether to go to court. He already has powers to behave in this way—powers given by Parliament as recently as 1970 in regard to the initial application procedure—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No money passes at that stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If one was to write this amendment into the Bill it would be difficult to frame a provision which adequately covered all the contingencies which might arise when recovery would be proper. There would be a danger of undue and unintended restriction. It would be inequitable to single out the Minister by forcing him, in all circumstances, to resort to the courts to recover money. In any case, the ordinary citizen
	<span class='label label-info column'>720</span>
has power to obtain money from persons who are in his debt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not true to say that other Ministers have the right to claim money back from individuals without taking them to court? Is it not true that the Secretary of State for Social Services can claim back money that has been overpaid without taking the individual concerned to court?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the case. The Minister is not being given powers in excess of those given to other Ministers. Indeed, the Minister already has powers for one part of the grant procedure under the 1970 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to whether the Minister must take court proceedings, the answer is " No " because every prosecuting authority, including the Minister, has a discretion. That is the point I have been making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Section 61 of the Agriculture Act 1967, grants may be paid for purposes connected with the co-operative activities of agricultural or horticultural co-operatives. Many of the purposes for which such grants may be paid are akin to the purposes grant-aidable under the Farm and Horticulture Capital Grants Scheme and, like these Schemes, " co-operation grants " follow a two-stage procedure. First, an application must be made to the Central Council for Agricultural and Horticultural Co-operation, and following a recommendation by the Council, Ministry approval is given. When work is completed a formal claim for grant must be rendered either to the Council or the Ministry before grant is paid. In certain projects, for example, large buildings, staged payments are sometimes made. Section 61(4) and (5) contain very similar provisions to those in Section 29(4) to which I referred, and do not give specific statutory power to recover grant paid as a result of a false or fraudulent statement on the grant claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original decision to close this loophole in the 1970 Act, which I think should reassure hon. Members, was based on examination by the Public Accounts Committee which was limited to Capital Grants Schemes. Since the hon. Gentleman's amendment which dealt with the " appointed persons " procedure was laid, an examination of other schemes with that procedure was made. I claim that under the Agricultural and Horticultural Cooperation Scheme, Ministers similarly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0398">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>721</span>
have no statutory powers in respect of recovery of grant paid as a result of false or reckless claims. It is not proposed at this stage to deal with that measure, because the Co-operation Scheme comes to an end next year, when new arrangements may have to be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

The other aspect which I underline to the hon. Gentleman is that this is not a judicial matter. In a case in which the matter has been before the court there can be little doubt about the outcome. But in respect of other cases it is not a judicial inquiry. I emphasised that the inquiry will be called essentially to determine the facts of the case, having regard to the relevant agricultural considerations. In practice, appeals are heard by the members of the nine regional panels—which were set up in 1972 when the county agricultural executive committees were disbanded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The panels, which provide valuable advice to the Ministry and to the Minister are non-statutory advisory bodies comprising about 12 members. They include farmers, landowners, and workers, and are broadly representative of all sections of the industry with expertise in the main farming systems in the region. Under the various enactments dealing with capital grant schemes, when it is proposed to reject an application or a claim for grant,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a simple amendment and relevant arguments have already been put forward. The major argument has been provided by the Minister of State. In rejecting Amendment No. 122, we have decided that the person presiding should not necessarily be someone who is legally qualified. This means that anyone may be</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>722</span>
	<p>or to recover grant, or revoke approval, the Minister must accord to the interested party an opportunity of appearing before and being heard by a person he has appointed for the purpose and he must consider that person's report. Panel members may be selected to act as "Appointed Persons" for this purpose. In respect of other grants or subsidies, a small group of the panel mayhear the applicant's representations. Again they submit their report to the Minister.</p>
	<p>I emphasise that the panels can submit a factual report or make recommendations, but it is the Minister who has the right and the power to decide. I appreciate hon. Member's concern about the protection which should be afforded to the industry. However, I point out that the powers we seek are merely an extension into another part of the grant application of the powers the Minister already possesses in that part of the Bill concerning the initial application.</p>
	<p>On this occasion we are taking action on the recommendation of the Public Accounts Committee. This is the first occasion that the Government of the day has had the opportunity to take the powers necessary to come into line with what the Public Accounts Committee had in mind.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put</i>: That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided</i>: Ayes 7, Noes 9.</p>
	<p>given the task of assessing the evidence and deciding the procedure, even to the extent of deciding other than what is laid down in the rest of this clause. No one could say that that is a satisfactory procedure. It manifestly offends the rules of natural justice and I regret that that point has not been digested by those responsible for introducing this clause.</p>
	<p>We should, at least, shy from having the injured victim deciding who the unqualified judge should be. The purpose of Amendment No. 123 is to ensure that somebody who is independent of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0399">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>723</span>
Minister should report on the evidence and decide on the procedure to be adopted in assessing that evidence. It is offensive that the Minister should appoint this person—whoever that may be. He could appoint the doorkeeper, a retired civil servant—anyone—it seems,to carry out a judicial inquiry. The Minister used the phrase " a legal-type inquiry". If we are to have this, let us at least have someone from outside the Ministry who is in a position to appoint an independent person. The Lord Chancellor is in a position to make this appointment ashe has a list of " the great and the good " who are available for inquiries of any kind. It would therefore be appropriate for him to decide who is to carry out this legal-type inquiry.</p>
	<p>It is not for the Minister to make the appointment. Perhaps he will tell us what this person should be called. I assume he or she will be called the chairperson. We should have more information since the whole matter is getting smellier and smellier. I hope that some of the smell will be dispersed by the Minister of State conceding that he should not be the judge in his own court, and should not appoint the judge in his own court when he is a victim, but should allow the Lord Chancellor to select the right person.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I need not say much on this amendment, which is inextricably tied up with the last amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to emphasise that this is not a legal matter. The inquiry will be essentially to determine the facts of the case having regard to all the relevant agricultural considerations. Matters of law are not involved. It would, therefore, be inappropriate to set up a legal-type inquiry, as is implicit in the amendment, especially as the appointed person is called upon not to make a decision, but to report the facts and, if he so wishes, to make a recommendation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The applicant's interests would be well looked after, because the members of the regional panel, who would be appointed to deal with the matter and give the Minister the facts, would, of course, be representative of the agriculture industry the land owners, the farmers, and all the others who are involved. Therefore, the Minister should have power to deal with the situation where the grant has been paid just as he has power to deal with the recovery of money in connection with the initial application for the grant. With that
	<span class='label label-info column'>724</span>
assurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider withdrawing his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot withdraw my amendment. We have clearly been told that it will be a legal-type inquiry. I appreciate that matters of law may not be involved. Not many matters of law are raised in magistrates' courts. If some drunk knocks me down on the pavement, the resulting prosecution does not raise matters of law. There are rules of procedure and of evidence to establish whether the man was drunk and whether he knocked me down. Those rules, which have been worked out over the years by trial and error and a great deal of deliberation, ensure that injustices do not arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State said that we should have a legal-type inquiry with all the evidence assembled and a decision reached on whether someone was culpable to the point of being in that grey area to such an extent as to make him a criminal. I suggest that any inquiry of the kind proposed must be based on the procedures and rules which have been settled over the centuries to ensure that injustice is not done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who adopt a cynical attitude may say that lawyers have created a great edifice or mumbo-jumbo of procedure and rules of evidence in order to earn a larger livelihood. But these rules, which are fairly simple, have been devised to prevent injustices being done. They maintain a balance so that neither the plaintiff nor the defendant has an advantage over the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my hon. Friend could enlighten the Committee. As soon as the procedures adumbrated in Clause 15 are set into motion and the appropriate person appointed by the Minister reaches his conclusions could a prosecution ultimately ensue on the basis of those very findings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, a prosecution could follow. The farmer concerned would be prejudiced in the true meaning of the word. If an inquiry had taken place and there had been a finding in favour of the Minister and the money had been repaid, a prosecution could follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may now say " We will not do that sort of thing". The fact of the matter is that, as the Bill stands, he has the power to do that kind of thing. This is why the clause is unsatisfactory.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0400">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>725</span>
I hope that the Minister of State will take account of the matters that I have raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every day Parliament gives more power to the State over the individual. It goes on year after year, and the responsibility and liberty of the citizen diminishes. It must diminish with every Act of Parliament. One day the whole system will seize up. Those who entice Ministers to make complacent speeches and to prevail upon Parliament to give more powers to their officials will be responsible. The system will seize up just as the old Chinese empire seized up. There were so many mandarins that nothing ever happened. This country will become like that if we are not careful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to have legal-type inquiries—that phrase is the Minister's, not mine—and if, as we have just decided, the man in charge of that inquiry is not to be legally qualified, then he should be appointed by somebody who is independent of the Minister. I suggested the Lord Chancellor, because he could appoint someone on whom he could rely to apply the rules of natural justice and behave in a satisfactory and reasonable way not only to the farmer who has been given the money and who, if he loses it, might be wholly ruined as a result, but to the Minister. We need someone who is and is seen to be independent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fall back on the old phrase that justice must not only be done, but be seen to be done. The Minister said that he would tell the farmer that he may have to repay the money and that the Minister would appoint the person to conduct the legal-type inquiry. Justice ought to appear to be done. The farming industry as a whole would consider it to be fairer and that justice would more likely appear to be done if an independent person were appointed by the Lord Chancellor. If the Lord Chancellor made the appointment, no one in the farming industry would complain, even though the appointed person were not legally qualified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will say that he will reconsider this matter on Report. We are giving powers to the Minister which go far beyond what is reasonable and necessary. We should pause and ask ourselves whether we should go as far as is proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>726</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not much to add. The hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) got steamed up about the powers of the State. I remind him that the Public Accounts Committee in the 1972/73 Session, after examining the Ministry on its treatment of improper claims, recommended that this gap in our recovery powers should be closed. Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that these people are sinister? The Public Accounts Committee examines the workings of Departments. Having heard the officials from the Ministry concerned, the Public Accounts Committee recommended what action should be taken. We are merely paying heed to and acting on the recommendations of the PAC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new power of recovery will, like the existing one, be subject to the appeals procedure contained in Section 29(4) of the Agriculture Act 1970. If the applicant wishes it, the inquiry can be held before a person appointed by the Minister. We have always thought that the regional panels are best able to supply people who have an interest in agricultural aspects. In any case, the Ministry has legal advisers and there is no bar to representation of the application if he so wishes. But, in the end, when the facts have been given—and I refer not to a legal but an agricultural inquiry—the Minister then has to decide whether there is a case. Action can then be taken using the powers sought in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with a situation where public money may, with very good reason, have been paid out to someone with no proper right to it. Ministries and Departments, which must be accountable for the use of public funds, are seeking powers which the PAC has asked us to seek. I hope that with that assurance the hon. Member will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the Public Accounts Committee make any recommendation from which it could be inferred that it was in favour of the Minister appointing a person to conduct the inquiry?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, am I not right in saying that the Lord Chancellor appoints the chairman and the tribunal? The kind of person one would hope would conduct this kind of inquiry is the kind of man who might be the chairman of an Agricultural Lands Tribunal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not gone into great detail about the PAC recommendations.

	<span class='label label-info column'>727</span>
It recommended that the gap should be closed in the treatment of improper claims. As the first part of the application procedure for grant has been covered since 1970 by the procedure we are now seeking, the obvious inference is that we should seek the same power in the case where the money has been paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the hon. Gentleman's second question, the Minister is responsible for the working of his Department and the use of funds. Therefore he is accountable. When he has powers to seek recovery after setting up an inquiry in the way I have suggested, the people concerned, having heard all the evidence, can report to him for his decision.

	<span class='label label-info column'>728</span>
	<p>Tribunal, on which it depended—was given to the defence beforehand. The Minister is saying that it is the successor to the War Acts arrangements which did not have a legal head. It is a very different matter with the Agricultural Lands Tribunal.</p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
A hearing of the Agricultural Lands Tribunal involves a dispute between two parties, usually landlord and tenant, and is a quasi-judicial inquiry. The " appointed person " is not concerned with a dispute but he records the representations. The inquiry does not make the decision.

conferred upon the Minister. I hope that in a year or two, when we have another Minister to introduce a repealing measure we shall have an Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill introduced by another kind of Government to bring this provision to an end. Of course we must have safeguards. The Public Accounts Committee is right in saying that the Minister should be diligent to prevent the fraud and waste which are almost inherent in the grants system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am against all these grants. The sooner they go, the better. Then we shall not have to argue as we are doing now. I think that every efficient farmer would agree with me. It is monstrous that the taxpayers and other industries, some of which are struggling to pay their taxes at present, should be called upon to pay even more tax to enable an industry such as agriculture to expand more than is economically wise. I very much regret the artificial expansion which is caused by the system of grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the system—T know that the Opposition Front Bench likes the system of grants and subsidies, creating " little Chryslers " in agriculture and elsewhere—we must have safeguards against fraud. But the proper place to prevent fraud is in the criminal court. If there is to be a grey area, we should be diligent in making sure that the rules in that grey area, where there will be quasi-criminal type inquiries, should be such that the rules of natural justice are adhered to as carefully as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I regret that there will not be a person appointed by the Lord Chancellor, or someone legally qualified, to be in charge of what will be—if may repeat myself using the Minister's phrase—" legal-type " inquiries over quasi-criminal matters which, in most people's minds, will be criminal matters. If false information is given, it is criminal. Such inquiries should be conducted by a person who has some experience of assessing the evidence and conducting a procedure that is fair to both parties. I very much regret what the Minister has done this morning. In due course we shall have cases in which the Minister will hold these inquiries in lieu of criminal proceedings. We shall then hear about farmers being called upon 'o nay hack money when

I hope that the Minister has received a voluminous brief from the County Councils' Association, as I have, about this new clause. I do not intend to read through the brief because I am sure that the Minister fully understands what it is about. just want to produce the salient facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
County councils are entitled to grants such as are paid to private owners of agricultural land in respect of their smallholding estates. They are also entitled to supplementary grants under farm amalgamation schemes. In both these cases, the applications had to be made by 31st December 1975. It is this deadline which is causing difficulty and which the new clause seeks to remedy by providing an extension of five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was on the Norfolk County Council Smallholdings Estate which, for many years was the largest county council smallholding estate until the amalgamation of the Isle of Ely and Cambridgeshire. I know the immense job</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question Put:</i></p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 8.</p>
	<p>that the estate agent and his staff have in running this estate.</p>
	<p>The background to this issue is to be found in Part III of the Agriculture Act 1970, which followed the Wise Report on smallholdings. The Minister will remember that the purpose of smallholdings was changed from what it was formerly, namely, a ladder for agricultural workers to come into smallholdings and progress upwards, thus retaining an agricultural force of workers on the land. It was changed to open a gateway—as it was termed—for young and experienced people with the right qualifications, whoever they were, to enter on the bottom rung of a farming career. That was the purpose of the Wise Report's recommendations which were put into effect in the 1970 Act.</p>
	<p>It meant a major reorganisation of smallholdings to provide a better livelihood for those already there. Whereas 20 or 30 years ago, on some of the better land between my home and Wisbech one could earn a reasonable living on 30 or 40 acres, one now needs double the acreage. A reasonable living is still obtained from our better lands. growing strawberries. and so on. on that type of acreage. With poorer soils. of course, one needs a much larger acreage.</p>
	<p>Under Section 40 of the Act, smallholdings authorities had to review their estates and submit proposals by 1st February 1972. The Minister agreed that because of the considerable reorganisation required, that should be spread—if I have the phraseology correct—over a period of years. Section 50 allowed the smallholdings authorities to nay for the creation of permanent holdings, something not unusual in amalgamations, because normally that is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0404">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>733</span>
not a stepping-stone to the formation of a commercial unit. But it was felt to be necessary in the reorganised smallholdings estates.</p>
	<p>Both Sections 50 and 51 grants had to be applied for by 31st December 1975. Some counties, especially the small counties with small acreages, were able to complete the task in a short time. But some of the larger counties—particularly those which had had amalgamation problems, where local government reorganisation had joined together several counties, and where financial restraints had been in force, so far as I can remember ever since I was born, with the exception of a few brief purple patches—were prevented from making their applications in time. For example, the new County of Humberside, inherited approximately 9 600 acres of holdings from three former county council areas.</p>
	<p>I am sure that the Minister and his supporters agree that it is right that authorities should not rely on notices to quit to reorganise their holdings. Tinder good estate management practice they could probably apply for, and serve, notice to quit. If a counter-notice was taken out, they could carry the matter to the Agricultural Lands Tribunal, on good estate management grounds that the amalgamation was essential and therefore could deprive a smallholder of his holding. But rightly, as a matter of practical policy, authorities do not do this.</p>
	<p>I am not sure whether my own county is the one quoted in the brief which I have, but one of the East Anglian County Council smallholdings authorities had 925 holdings in 1971. By 31st December 1975. following amalgamations making larger holdings thus rendering them more viable, and giving a proper livelihood to those remaining, there were 787 holdings. But the long-term proposals mean that there will be 592 holdings. We are, therefore, about half-way there in this particular case.</p>
	<p>The turnover of tenancies is what I would term on a 35-year rotation, which is about the average time that it takes to obtain possession of holdings. It will thus be seen that more time is needed if the reorganisation, recommended by the Wise Report, is to be
	<span class='label label-info column'>734</span>
carried out properly. To do that, the grants are needed. There is no doubt about that. I therefore hope that the Minister who, I am sure, knows well the facts of the situation and has had representations made to him, will accept that the new clause, or a similar clause if he does not like this wording, would enable county councils to go on receiving the grants. I hope that he will take steps to extend the time limit by a further five years.</p>

Member has covered the question of the purpose of the grants There is no dispute between us on the desirability of reorganisation and on the objective of creating a more balanced structure of viable full-time holdings. The hon. Gentleman has explained the background to the issue in respect of the 1970 Act and the Wise Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the hon. Gentleman, however that it was made clear at the outset that these supplementary grants—I shall return to that subject—were to operate for a period of five years. That was always made clear to the authorities. As the hon. Member knows, there has been a good take-up. Therefore we cannot accept that we should continue the grants beyond the five years to which we agreed. In an ideal world, in which no one had to pay for the provisions, we should like to do it. But the hon. Member knows that we are living at a time when we are trying to restrain public expenditure. I am glad that none of the hon. Gentleman's hon. Friends on the Onnosition Front Bench supported the hon. Member, because his argument was. of course, a plea for additional public expenditure.

The hon. Gentleman must bear in mind that we are not ending the grants completely. These capital grant applications will still be eligible for the normal rate of grant. I am sure that the impetus which the provisions of the 1970 Act gave, and which the additional rate of grant gave under submission of reorganisation plans. will be followed through by the local authorities.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully appreciate what the Minister said about restraining expenditure. I can only say, however, that if the applications had been in by 31st December, the authorities would have been entitled to the claims. It is not something which the Minister was not expecting to have to pay. I should have thought that when applications have not been made for good reasonsa—nd I am sure the Minister would admit that the reasons are good—that would have been a factor to take into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister clarify one matter? He said that the provision was made absolutely clear. My information is that it was not made clear. In fact, my brief states that the Association cannot recall any clear statement that the transitional period would only be five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So that the fact may be put on record, if the Minister has the information I should like to know whether the period was definitely stated. I understood that the provision was to operate for a period of years but that five years was never stated.

	<p>"Section 7 of the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 1949 which makes provision for the variation of rent of an agricultural holding) shall be read and have effect as if in subsection (3) thereof for the words ' five years ' there were substituted the words three years'".—[	<i>Mr. Wiggin.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, that the clause be read a Second time. The brevity of my remarks in no way detracts from the importance of the new clause. Fortunately it does not deal with a complex issue but a simple and straightforward matter. I remind the
	<span class='label label-info column'>736</span>
Parliamentary Secretary of what he said at our last sitting:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It was against this background that the Government concluded that since the law was being amended in England and Wales, it would be more satisfactory if the law in scotland was brought broadly into line."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee</i> C, 19th February 1976, 	<i>c.</i> 702.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman pressed that sentiment to a conclusion by insisting on the maintenance in the Bill of a clause to which the Opposition were opposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the new clause we are suggesting that the law in Scotland be brought into line with that for England and Wales. In England and Wales a landlord is permitted to serve notice on his tenant to review the tenant's rent every three years. The tenant, of course, possesses a like right. In practice, tenants rarely press their landlords to arbitration on rent unless they are suffering from a special circumstance. The nature of the farm may be altered or occasionally a farmer who has a rather high rent may take his landlord to arbitration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the legislation was originally drafted nobody envisaged inflation on the scale at which it is running today. It seems reasonable that rents should be reviewed every three years. I see no argument for differentiating between Scotland, and England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very briefly, because I know that the Committee wants to make progress, I feel I should comment on the argument that this proposal would bring Scotland into line with England and Wales. It is one thing for the Minister, who I think put unnecessary stress on this argument, to say that the law in Scotland should be brought into line with that in England and Wales when it means that we are moving forward. But it is a very different thing when it means that we are moving backwards. With respect, that is what I think would happen here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the Minister was wrong to put undue weight on that particular argument. At the time, I said that the reason for doing it that way was just. My reason for opposing the new clause is neither that it would bring Scotland into line with England nor change the law in Scotland for the same reason. but because it is unjust. I should prefer to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0406">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>737</span>
see England moving in the five-year direction than Scotland moving in the three-year direction. I am sorry that the Lonservative party, in trying to bring two situations into line, did not think of moving in the five-year direction. It would have been equally logical and just. For that reason, I do not think that the Minister's argument is sound.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I oppose the new clause because it goes backwards, not forwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that the new clause should have come from the Opposition. It is exactly in line with the main tenor and balance of their arguments which are for the landlord rather than for the tenant. That is exactly in line with their philosophy—deeply and honestly held—but put forward somewhat luke warmly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is thought curious that we should take this line of wanting to retain things which are better in Scotland than in England and 	<i>vice versa,</i> there will be an interesting example on Friday. The Divorce (Scotland) (No. 2) Bill will bring us roughly into line with the situation in England and Wales. That Bill, brought forward by a Member of the Scottish National Party, recognises that we should bring forward the law in Scotland, because it will be making progress. But this new clause instead of making progress, is reactionary. Therefore, we must oppose it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) suggested that the new clause would be unjust. I have never heard such nonsense. I have been trying this weekend to settle some rents with tenants who have gladly offered double the rent of three years ago. Obviously, over the past two years, it has been very unjust that a landlord should have been receiving a rent which was probably considerably out of date because it was just three years ago. With the present rate of inflation, three years is a short time. Some 10 years ago, when we had static rents, I should reasonably have argued that five years was the right period. But today one cannot argue that. Three years is about the right period. The landlord always seems to be equated with somebody owning vast estates, driving round in a bowler hat with a whip in his hand—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And gaiters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>738</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—and gaiters. I know many people who have been left farms of under DUO acres who depend on them for their entire livelihood. Charities, wnich depend on rents from small acreages of land, should be allowed to bring their rents into line with what tenants will gladly pay. The period should definitely be three years. I wholeheartedly support the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) has made the wrong point. We ought to have almost annual revisions of rent from now on in fairness to the tenant as well as to the landlord. Agriculture will have a lot of difficulties to face, and the hon. Gentleman shares my view on one of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the next year or two years, when the wheat mountain and the other mountains get too high, I think that we shall see such drastic reforms in CAP that tenants in Norfolk and Lincolnshire will not go begging for a double increase in rent, but will say that they cannot pay the existing rent. Rents in Lincolnshire are very high—higher than in Norfolk—and that position cannot continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are, of course, concerned with Scotland where farming is conducted on a different basis. Scottish farmers scratch around on land growing wheat and other crops which should be grown only in East Anglia. They think that they can make a living out of growing these crops—indeed, they appear to be doing so at the moment—but I foresee that in a year or two years they will not be doing so. For that reason, I think that the period should be three years, not five years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) at some time during the Summer Recess will take a trip to Scotland and look at some of the agricultural land there which produces very high yields of wheat. I do not want to be drawn on that question or on the general issue of rents, which is a controversial subject. I am grateful that hon. Members on the Opposition Front Bench have not taken us into the deep and fundamental arguments between hon. Members on both sides regarding rent levels and the general rule on rent income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr.

	<span class='label label-info column'>739</span>
Buchan) intervened, because he brought out the salient defect in and argument against the hon. Member's remarks. Of course, there are times when we believe it is right for Scotland to come into line with England, but we cannot accept the policy that there should be harmonisation for its own sake. We must look at each issue on its merits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Landowners' Federation and the National Farmers' Union of Scotland have been having discussions over possible amendments to the Agricultural Holdings Acts, and I hope that agreement will be reached on a code which will be generally acceptable. On this issue, not surprisingly, no agreement has been reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make two other brief points. Although the minimum period for rent revision is five years in Scotland, our information suggests that the average period within which rents are revised is considerably longer. According to our latest information, the period is between six and seven years. That means that in many cases it has not been necessary to revise the rents as often as every five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is obvious, and I am sure that the hon. Member for Westonsuper-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) is very familiar with it. If a landlord makes an improvement on the holding, that immediately enables him to renegotiate the rent to take that into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have decided not to accept the new clause, because we do not believe that it would be right at this time to introduce three-year reviews of rents in Scotland. I see the force of argument in relation to inflation, but I must make it clear that the Government see the current rate of inflation as a temporary phenomenon. All the economic indicators show that the Government are winning the battle against inflation and that, in a year or two years, we shall be returning to the rates of inflation which are generally acceptable. I hope that when the inflation battle has been won, hon. Members, although they are not able to give us the wholehearted support which we deserve, will nevertheless agree that it is desirable that we should maintain the present five-year reviews.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Minister will agree that he does not want to give the impression that, because an improvement is made, a general revision of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>740</span>
whole of the rent can be undertaken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It sounded as though that might be meant. I should like it to be understood that it would be on the improvement, not a general revision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) revealed again that he hates all landlords and thinks that all tenants are good. He has been saying that in every debate we have had in this Committee. The new clause not only allows the tenant to go for a rent review more frequently, but deals with what is fair. When something is pointed out as being fair which does not suit the hon. Gentleman politically, he leaps up and down and makes angry noises. Everything else is apparently all right. I have no doubt that those who study these matters will not have failed to notice that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a little disturbed by the Minister's opening comments. It seemed that there was a trace of agreement with that sterile argument. I hope that that is not the case because I feel that it is the Minister's duty to see that this agricultural land-owning legislation is fair to both parties. We have already argued that it is important for this nation to maintain the same structure of landowning and land-renting. To turn down this small amendment which would have a substantially helpful effect on investment in Scotland shows that his point has not been properly made. I shall ask my hon. Friends to vote in favour of the new Clause 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To take the heat out of the argument and to be fair to both sides—especially to tenants and landlords in Scotland—may I ask the Minister to tell us what representations he has received from tenants or landlords in Scotland about whether they wish the term changed from five to three years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because this is basically a Scottish Office matter, I cannot immediately tell the hon.

I have in mind the only two estates that the Minister has in England under an old statute of 1916. Both these estates are in parts of Holland, one at Holbeach of 1,000 acres and the other at Sutton Bridge of 5,500 acres. The Minister has several hundred full-time and part-time tenants there.

The tenants have been looking after these two estates for a long time. I have been rather taciturn about it.

We have had the good fortune of having an able land agent appointed by

A great deal has happened since then which may make it right for the Minister to reconsider this policy and see whether the ownership should not pass to the county council. This should be the subject of a tenants' meeting. If the Minister is to come, will he agree that not just a few hand-picked tenants should be invited but that there should be a full meeting? If there were only a few tenants it would be an insignificant number. There are hundreds of these people. Some have considerable problems. There are many whom the Minister would meet who have become old men in the hope that their sons might succeed. The Government do not believe in sons succeeding their fathers in a tenancy. These old men have had no assurance from the Minister about whether their sons will succeed them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Old men struggle on. No private landlord would allow that to happen. Not even the hon. Member for Renfrew-shire, West (Mr. Buchan) could name a single landlord who would behave in this way.

Council's Smallholdings Committee and would therefore have ready access to the management of those estates and would be able to speak on their behalf in a way that no one can speak at the moment. All the tenants have now is a Member of Parliament who has been taciturn on this subject and who has not brought before the Minister some policy matters. He may not be aware of these matters particularly the point about sons succeeding fathers. This is where there is a real injustice and concern. The tenants would gain by having a transfer to a county council rather than control from Whitehall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister assured us that he would come. I hope it will not be a flying visit of an hour or two, but that he will put on his gum boots and meet some of the farmers who, in difficult conditions, are struggling to earn a living on a few acres. When the Minister comes, he will marvel at the efficiency of the farming and will perhaps make satisfactory comparisons with Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a near neighbour and somebody who has done quite a bit of work on those holdings, I should point out that the question of transfer to county council smallholdings was brought up four or five years ago. I welcome the Minister's visit. It is good that he will view things on the spot. I have not yet made up my mind whether direct administration by the Ministry would be best. As only a small amount of smallholding land is administered by the Ministry, I should have thought the expertise of the Holland Smallholdings Committee would be worth looking at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has pointed to a real advantage. County council smallholding tenants have the right to elect a certain number of people to represent them on the smallholdings committee—not just the county councillor elected for that particular area.

he is not aware—that last year instructions were issued to the effect that, all other things being equal, a close relative of a deceased tenant would be permitted to take over the vacant tenancy. The Smallholdings (Selection of Tenants) Regulations 1970 already provide a form of family succession. For example, a widow is able to apply for a tenancy provided she continues to live in the farmhouse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My instructions are that, if a tenants' selection committee on an estate considers that a close relative should not inherit, the final decision will lie with the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman wants to know what has happened when tenants have given up their holdings, he will find the statistics very encouraging. Since February 1974, nine holdings on the Farm Settlement estates have fallen vacant. The tenants had no sons or daughters interested in the tenancies, which were often let to people on " starter " holdings who wished to progress to larger holdings. The " starter " holdings were often let to the sons of tenants on the estate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding elderly tenants who are afraid to retire, 10 tenants over 70 years of age are farming holdings of 40 acres or more. Although they all have sons, only one since 1969 has asked for his son to be allowed to take over his tenancy. However, as the son's wife refused to live on the holding, the application was not pursued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding arrangements for my visit, I make it obligatory that I meet tenants who are representative, not handpicked. Just as one insists upon meeting the elected representatives of workers when visiting a factory, so, when visiting an estate of this nature, one insists either on an open meeting, as my hon. Friend suggested, or on meeting people who are elected by the tenants themselves. However, I shall certainly give advance notice of my visit, which will probably be early Summer or late Spring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause is designed to enable land to be let for a short period—in proper cases, for more than one year—with the Minister's approval. I should tell the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) that in no circumstances can this new clause be interpreted as not benefiting both tenant and landlord equally. There is no case for suggesting that this is a biased new clause, but it deliberately breaches the existing law—I make no bones about that—for a matter of mutual convenience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present a letting, or a licence to occupy, agricultural land either for a period of less than a year or for a term of two years or more, will not end at the expiration of the term but will be converted by the statutory magic of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948 into a protected tenancy from year to year under the Act. An exception to this is provided by section 2 of the 1948 Act whereby the letting or licence is not converted into a protected tenancy if the Minister's approval is first obtained. Section 2 is so worded, however. that the Minister cannot approve a letting when it is a letting
	<br><blockquote><p>"for an interest less than year to year",</p></blockquote>
though oddly he can approve a mere 	<i>licence</i> to occupy for a longer period, which is anomalous and unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By section 3 of the 1948 Act a tenancy for a fixed term—that is a term of years—of two years or more shall not end automatically at the end of the fixed term, but will continue as a protected tenancy from year to year—that is, terminable by notice to quit, but only if and when the Act allows it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that some judicial rulings on this interpretation have left an area of uncertainty, but the purpose of the new clause is to allow greater flexibility in short-term situations.

If the Minister is prepared to accept the spirit of the new clause, I should be prepared to accept an amendment to delete
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food"</p></blockquote>
and to put in the Crown Court, a magistrates' court or some other more readily available body which could judge from outside. It has been suggested that, because of the machinations of bureaucracy, the Minister may not be very quick to give his approval. I should be happy, if the principle is acceptable, to see a different new clause to the same effect—that, where tenant and landlord are in agreement on a term of years, but not more than seven—that would apply not to lifetime tenancies, but to some odd field or smallholding leading to the long-term reorganisation of an estate—they could both go to the court or to the Minister to approve the agreement. I think that, although it breaches the law, it is a reasonable proposition which will be to the mutual benefit of all affected parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) has moved the new clause very fairly As he explained, such short-term lettings can take place where the Minister gives his specific approval. I undertake to look at the administration to ensure that it is being expedited as quickly as is reasonably practicable. We certainly do do not want a cumbersome procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would be the first to acknowledge that we do not want a situation to develop whereby it becomes prevalent practice for its own sake—in other words, that we have a movement away from letting a farm to a farmer for his lifetime to a situation where landlords are prepared to let whole farms on short lets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guidelines within which we work with regard to giving permission for such short-term lettings were laid down in 1974 under the Conservative Administration. Briefly, the guidelines are that the Minister's approval shall be limited to a narrow range of cases where it would be unreasonable to grant a full agricultural tenancy; for example, where land is scheduled for development within a reasonable time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised a fair point regarding administration. I shall be
	<span class='label label-info column'>748</span>
happy to look at it. But to allow complete freedom here brings in the danger of striking at the heart of our approach to the letting of agricultural land—namely, that as far as possible the farm should be let to a tenant farmer for his lifetime so that he may plan ahead and know that his investment in the land will be to his benefit. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would be the first to acknowledge that a prevalence of short lettings would lead to a situation in which people were not adequately investing in the land and were allowing the levels of nutrients to fall to a low level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think there is much between us. I assume that hon. Members would not want that to become prevalent. I shall look at the administrative side.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For once, the Minister has produced a cogent argument which I can accept. I thank him for his kindness in agreeing to look into the administration of the present operations. It is not a loophole—perhaps I should not use the word "loophole"—or device that is used much. Perhaps when the Minister writes to me he will be more informative about that aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That further consideration of the Eill be now adjourned until a date and time to be fixed by the Chairman.</p></blockquote>
Hon. Members will be aware that my reason for moving the Adjournment Motion is to enable more new clauses to be tabled. I hope that fairly soon after the tabling the Committee will be recalled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all aware of the background to the motion moved by the Minister of State. On 3rd February, when the Minister told us that it was the Government's intention to introduce a new clause to deal with the inheritance of farm tenancies, I said that we hoped that we should have plenty of time to consider the implications of that new clause. We all know the Government have not yet been able to table that clause, and we understand that consultations are still proceeding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In moving the motion, the Govern-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0412">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>749</span>
ment are honouring the Minister's undertaking that, if necessary, the Committee would be adjourned for a time until the new clause was tabled. My plea this morning is that, when the new clause is tabled, we should have a reasonable time to consider its implications and to consult with those who are concerned with it. I do not know when it will be possible to table the new clause. If the Government were able to table it on Thursday this week, I am not sure that it would be possible for us to conduct all our consultations by Thursday of next week. If the Government were to table the new clause on Thursday this week, it would not become generally available until Friday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As you know, Mr. Costain, many Members have to return to their constituencies on Friday. I have an engagement in my constituency on Friday morning which I am anxious not to postpone. Therefore, effectively it would be Monday before we had the opportunity of fully considering the new clauses. That would lead to difficulties in tabling amendments, which would have to be done by Tuesday. I hope that, if the new clause is tabled by Thursday this week, the Committee will not meet again until two weeks today. That would give us a full week in which to consider the new clause. That would be helpful. I see that some of my hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells) also agree. If, between us, we can prevail
	<span class='label label-info column'>750</span>
that argument upon you, Mr. Costain, the motion moved by the Minister will be entirely acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem raised by the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) is also true for some members of the Government who may wish to examine the new clause. I am not arguing for a deferment until a fortnight today. If we are as close to tabling the new clause on Thursday, perhaps we are equally close to tabling it on Wednesday. That day brings us into this week, whereas Thursday would tend to push us out of this week. That period of 24 hours would have a bigger effect than nearly a week's effect for those of us who wish to study the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) acknowledged that the Minister was keeping his promise on this matter. We are anxious that the new clauses shall be discussed by the Committee before the later stages of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been consultations between the Government and the various parties concerned. I am hoping that the new clauses will be tabled in the next day or so, but I cannot give an exact time or promise. My right hon. Friend will take note of the observations made on both sides of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
