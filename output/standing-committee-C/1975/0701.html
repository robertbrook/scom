	<br><blockquote><p>'together with a copy of the statement of the audit directors in accordance with section 	<i>(Duly of the audit directors to make a statement) of this Act'.</i>—[	<i>Sir B. Rhys Williams.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had spoken for some time when we ended on Tuesday. I want to hear the views of the Minister and other colleagues in the Committee rather than dilate at great length on the detailed amendments I have suggested in connection with the audit committee and so forth, but I will round off my remarks if I may be permitted to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The faults in the Bill as it stands are that auditing is seen as too restrictive and too historical in the terms of data produced. The audit role in the Bill as it stands is contracted on to an even narrower professional basis at the very moment when it should be expanded and strengthened. In my series of amendments I am seeking to weld the two supervisory elements in the company, particularly large companies, into a more effective force, namely non-executive directors and the auditors, by drawing up a routine by which they would be obliged and enabled to work together in the audit committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The audit committee is not just a brainwave of the moment but arises from studies I have been able to make of the ways in which audit committees are becoming standard practice in many companies in Canada and America. I am concerned with the problem of not just setting up another committee but giving it authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
Firstly, this committee needs to have more facts as a matter of routine. I will not elaborate further on that because I hope to have the opportunity of saying more about it in connection with one of my later amendments. Secondly, we have to give the audit committee a statutory function which enables it to exert discipline within the firm. The suggestions I have made are thrown out as a talking point. I suggest that the audit committee should have a responsibility to report in detail to the board on the matters which it has considered, most if not all of which will be highly confidential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to make my position clear on the question of disclosure. In some ways the 1967 Act went too far regarding disclosure. We are not going to do anything more useful about the relatively inefficient or complacent company. I am not talking about fraudulent and scandalous firms, but the inefficient and complacent firm. I do not think it will be cured by being obliged to publish more data. The question arises—after disclosure what happens if medium-sized and smallish companies publish a whole lot more data? Few people will have time to analyse the data, and if they do they may get their interpretation wrong. Publishing more information may give people outside the firm a scent of what needs to be done, but in all too many cases the firm disclosing information will weaken itself 	<i>vis-è-vis</i> its competitors without doing anything to strengthen those forces which may be operating within the business to make it more efficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to encourage both medium and large firms to produce more data within the organisation for current analysis and estimation of future trends by the boards. The audit committee is the natural place for current figures and future estimates to receive thorough-going consideration. When this has been done the board must be acquainted with the findings of the audit committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the shareholders, if one were not to give some relationship between the board and the shareholders—between the auditors and the non-executive directors on the one side, and the shareholders on the other—one would be setting up powerless bodies which, in the event of a dispute, would be defeated because inevitably they would be either too
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0698">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>55</span>
junior or in the minority, and so not able to make themselves felt. So somewhere in the legislation one has to include for the supervisory elements a power which enables them to exert themselves within the company when they feel they must. Therefore I am suggesting tentatively that the non-executive directors who are members of the audit committee should be obliged to make a statement to the shareholders rather in the same way as auditors now have to make to the shareholders statements on the balance sheet, confirming that they consider that the data produced by the firm have been properly produced and that the board has given due consideration to their report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the non-executive directors are not satisfied with the data they are getting, and if they do not think that the reports they are making to the board are getting due consideration, they ought to resign anyway. I would like to embody in statute that they should have to make the statements as a matter of course. I do not envisage that it would often arise that the non-executive directors who are audit directors would wish to qualify their report, but it puts them in a position to say in the course of the year to their fellow directors " Unless you pay attention to our anxieties and the reports we are making about the future of the company and its profitability and so on, then we shall be in a position where we will have to qualify our report." That would enable them to exert themselves fruitfully inside the business without having to tear the whole thing apart and excite public attention at the first stage of uneasiness or disagreement within the management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to touch on the whole question of why it is necessary to legislate at all in this area. There are many people, particularly in business, who think that the House of Commons produces far too much legislation and is choking business by an almost inscrutable volume of new legislation which affects business life, sometimes favourably and sometimes unfavourably, and which often seems to be unnecessary and irrelevant. Here is the Member for Kensington producing volumes of new clauses affecting companies and the way they operate. Why is it necessary to legislate? That is a real point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
I do not think that we have time for the natural forces of competition and reform and the other pressures on management to work their way through the joint stock company and carry us into better practice just through the processes of discussion, argument and competition going on all the time. I look at the present state of the British economy. Of course one has to recognise that there are acting against efficiency in joint stock companies many pressures which have nothing to do with faults cf organisation or management, or the shortcomings of audit procedure or anything like that. We need to recognise that. quite apart from questions affecting the British economy from outside, our company law has been stagnant while in other countries a great deal of progress has been made. Therefore I do not think we can wait for natural processes. We need to hasten the introduction of better practice by legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am only attempting in these new clauses to catch the largest companies. I should explain to my colleagues who may think that it is an error on my part that on the Notice Paper there are two amendments which seem to be similar. I am not offering them as alternatives. One is not simply a redraft of the other. One is to deal with the major companies in the way I have suggested in Amendment 40, and the other, No. 41, with large companies which are somewhat smaller. It is a modest way I have suggested in Amendment 41. My colleagues can see precisely what I intend by studying my proposals and I do not think it is necessary for me to enlarge upon them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The major companies are those which I have defined as having more than £10 million of assets in the balance sheets or employing more than 2,000 people. The large companies are those with over £5 million of turnover or revenues or £2 million capital, or employ 500 people or more. Even if we were legislating for all those companies we would still only be catching a relatively small part of private enterprise. Therefore we are not initiating a tremendously cumbrous procedure which would be too burdensome or costly for small firms to carry out. I suggest we should have different procedures for the largest companies and the large companies, because companies
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0699">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
will move in and out of these categories, and one does not want them to have in the year of contraction to fold up completely an apparatus they may have set up; equally, a rapidly expanding firm should not be asked to go straight into an elaborate procedure which goes far beyond anything which it has begun to do in the process of growth. That is why initially I have suggested a modest form for the audit committee which in the largest company should become a full procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that many people will say that all good companies do something of this sort anyway There is a great deal of truth in that, but they perhaps do not do it in a profesional and thoroughgoing way. When one thinks of the arguments there are about data processing and the collation of current information and the ability of management to make long-term future projections we have to realise that we are still in a grey area. Legislation would help to focus the minds of professional people and management on their responsibility, and encourage firms which are only moderately profitable and teetering on the verge of unprofitability of inefficiency to seek out the best practice and hasten to implement it themselves. I ask hon. Members to contemplate what it would be like in a very large company if it did not collate routine data about its current affairs and make forward estimates of the future profitability of the business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we look at what might happen in a large firm which totally ignores the routines I have suggested we have to recognise that the proposals I am making are not far-reaching. The Bill as it stands seems to me to be quite wrong, in its approach. We have news this morning of the French Government's major innovations in company law based on the important Sudreau report and we know that there are many changes in America, Canada and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope my colleagues will think that I have done something useful in elaborating these proposals, and I hope that in asking the Minister to reply I can expect from the Government some guidance as to the trend of their thinking. It is no good their sheltering behind the fact that the Bullock Committee is sitting
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
and will come up with an important report, in the coming months on worker participation. Worker participation and everything which goes with it is an important development, but so much else has to be done urgently in company law. The Government have taken parliamentary time to introduce legislation this Session, but there are too many signs that parliamentary thinking in this area is behind the times and blinkered. However, I hope that the Minister will show that he is thinking in a forward sense in company law reform.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Neubert</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) need have no fear of lack of support for his wish to widen the discussion on the matter of company law and, if necessary, to embark on radical measures of reform. I commend him for the originality and enthusiasm of his contributions. It is a measure of the respect for his proposals that on Tuesday morning they should have received such extensive coverage in the serious Press. He has said that he wishes this Committee to be an opportunity for more extensive discussion than the Bill in its present form would provide. Rightly, he suggests that he is not proposing these amendments as tablets of stone and immutable, but that he is anxious merely to provoke and stimulate thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend will not object if I raise a note of caution about his proposals for audit directors. They could be seen as a further measure of consumer protection and are certainly intended for the interests of employees and shareholders of a company However, most other measures of consumer protection, in my experience, thought they may be desirable, prove expensive in practice. That is what concerns me. about the suggestion that there should be full-blooded audit directors, whose role would go some way beyond the present role of non-executive directors, and, in consequence, require more of their time and, therefore, a higher salary for that purpose. Immediately we would have the higher cost of salaries to be paid to such men.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We already know the traditional expense of auditors coming to a company It can be a considerable on-cost, not only because of the auditors' fees. but their need facilities for their work, which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0700">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>59</span>
may extend to requiring a number of staff employed over a considerable period of time. By painful experience we know, in these days of computer processing, that if a computer goes wrong or the support for that operation is inadequate and the company does not have the capacity to control its mechanical facilities, going back over the record and sorting out the mess can often take a considerable amount of time and money. Room has to be made available in offices and members of staff have to give up time to answer queries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Already the practice of audit, a necessary public safeguard, is an expensive burden on companies and has to be costed into the costs of the products or services which they provide. To extend this principle, to have within the company not only the traditional auditors from time to time when the annual accounts are being prepared. but, throughout the company year, men and women who have an independent role to ensure that decisions reached are in the interests of shareholders and employees, and in many other ways to see that company affairs are run on a proper basis, will inevitably involve not just the immediate cost of salaries but the unseen and intangible cost of company staff, time and facilities made available for the purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I welcome the spirit in which my hon. Friend has proposed these amendments I have that reservation, particularly at this time in our nation's affairs. I go one point further and say that the role of the audit director, as deSCribed, would inevitably require a man or woman of considerable calibre and commercial experience. If we are to have these watchdogs in companies it follows that they cannot also be available for executive directorships, nor can they be employed in other ways productively in commercial companies. One of our problems as a nation is that we have far too many people in administration, particularly in the national Government and local government service and in many other ways, rather than people within the productive areas of industry and commerce, making the money on which we depend as a nation for our prosperity. As there must be a finite number of the people required for these proposals we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
should go rather slowly in seeking to take from the labour market men or women who could be occupied in making profits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With these two reservations I generally welcome the intention to widen this debate, and if necessary to widen the provisions of the Bill. I look forward to hearing the comments of my hon. Friends and the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Romford (Mr. Neubert) I welcome the initiative and careful thought which my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) has put into his amendment and his suggestions. Indeed, the House is grateful to him for the care and devotion he has given to these subjects in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The audit directors he proposes will have an obligation to read out their report in general meeting. It seems to me that there is a danger here. Their report has to consider not only the companies' abiljty to pay its debts, which is a reasonable matter for the public to be aware of but has also to consider the future profitability of the company. This is crystal-ball gazing with a vengeance. It is prone to large margins of error. If these errors are read out at public meetings, the audit directors are going to look very foolish indeed. If they so look foolish, what will happen? They will tend to look at average figures, average predictions related to average plans by firms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Breaking in, which is diSCourteous—and I hope my hon. Friend will not take it in the wrong sense—may I say that my provision relates to what audit directors have to say to shareholders, and that is simply whether, in their opinion, the data and estimates provided have been properly prepared and whether, in their opinion, their reports to the board have been duly considered by the board. That does not require any diSClosure, or giving information in public. That does not require them to say what their long-term predictions are, whether they are optimistic or pessimistic, but simply to confirm that they are happy with the way the board is responding to the work they are doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend. That greatly strengthens his suggestions. I am sorry I misunderstood
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0701">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>61</span>
what he was going to do in this connection. If they are not crystal ball-gazing, their aspiration could be so much better and they would not have these influences to work to averages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All companies vary immensely in the relation of assets to turnover. I feel that the figures he has put into Amendment No. 41, the number of employees in excess of 1,500 or the total net assets in excess of £5 million, do not appear to have reasonable reference to each other. t is possible to imagine a farm with 20 men operating with capital assets of £5 million, or a small building firm which might employ as many as 1,000 men if it is lucky enough to get a contract and build up to that level quickly, but at the same time having very small assets. My hon. Friend might like to think again, to try to bring these two figures closer, so that at least the number of men would have to exceed 200 irrespective of the assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned, as is my hon. Friend the Member for Romford, with what kind of man the audit director will be. The duty of the auditor is to alert the board to the future of its cash liquidity and how this affects the balance. I should have thought that to be every director's duty at any time in any case. We already have a trend for institutions to place their men on boards. More and more this is happening, partly as a result of our system of taxation. which causes firms to go more and more into debt, and these institutions which lend them money or take stock in their equity place their men on the boards. Often, these are men who have a background in administration and accountancy. They may be excellent in checking excesses by the firm, but they are not always the engineers, the inventors, the dreamers, the people who create the real new wealth of the country, who inevitably move into an area of risk in their thoughts, in bringing their dreams to fulfilment. Before we place on firms a new form of directors with a separate duty from the rest, which might be more public than that of their seniors, men of administration rather than men accustomed to doing, and to getting things done, we should be very cautious and think it through much more carefully than my hon. Friend has so far enabled me to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to speak briefly because I believe that to move
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
in the direction of change in company law, to recognise the rights of employees to have a greater say and control over companies, is not only inevitable but highly desirable. I recognise that the Bullock Committee is sitting on this matter and I have tendered my evidence to that committee, but my fear is that its terms of reference are such that when it reports back within a few months that will not be sufficiently speedy to enable the Government to bring forward legislation in the next parliamentary year as promised, and that thus we shall have to wait another 12 months before we have the legislation with the changes necessary if we are to have industrial democracy before the next General Election. To that extent I believe that any small modifications that can be made in the right direction at this stage would be welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would say, however, to the hon. Gentleman who has proposed these amendments that I would like to see much more radical proposals for the control of companies. I believe that if participation or industrial democracy or workers' control, whatever term is chosen, is to be meaningful, then it must not be a cosmetic exercise but must have real power and put real responsibility into the hands of the working people. I do not put this forward from a dogmatic point of view. I believe that the reality of the situation, as has been shown by various industrial confrontations over the last three or four years, is that power lies effectively in the hands of the employees. It is a matter whether these employees choose to use that power to disrupt industry or chose to use it harmoniously and constructively for the benefit of industry. The long-term interest of all companies and industries is that the various groups and the various interests within industry co-operate harmoniously for the benefit and success of the venture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe, therefore, that the changes in company law that will be necessary are ones that will recognise the reality of industrial power that exists today and not only put the right of the election of a majority of directors in a company into the hands of all the employees. I say
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0702">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>63</span>
"all" employees meaningfully. I mean not only those working on the factory floor but those who work in the offices and those who manage the concern. They shall have the right to elect the majority of directors put into their hands. Thus responsibility for the success of the venture would also rest on their shoulders. So those people who now carry the power for good or evil in respect of the wellbeing of the company would also have the responsibility of making sure that the power is used in the long-term in the way they would have to answer for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This goes well beyond the provisions of this Bill. I would not expect this Bill to be able to deal with it. I would welcome a move forward in that direction. What would interest me most in the answer to be given by the Minister to this debate is knowing where the Government stand in relation to those provisions for industrial democracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Clinton Davis)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first of all say to the hon. Gentleman the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) that he has presented to the Committee views which are a considerable refinement of those which he has advanced previously in Bills which he has laid before the House and which have met with a tepid response—I think I am putting it a bit high—from successive Governments over a period of years. That is in no way to decry the value of the hon. Gentleman's thinking—as he has been thinking, in my view, constructively and positively—about company law reform. It is a great pity that there are not more people who are prepared to engage in the sort of research, investigation and wide examination of the issues as he has done over a period of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I am in a sense critical of some of his proposals I am sure the hon. Gentleman will not take umbrage at that fact. The hon. Gentleman said at our last sitting:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My formula offers a working basis for diSCussion. I hope that it will provoke interest among the Committee as to ways in which we should gradually move towards the fully-grown two-tier board".—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee C,</i> 29th June 1976; c. 50.]</p></blockquote>
From that I think I am entitled to deduce that the hon. Gentleman has, quite pro-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
perly, used this occasion to put forward his ideas for consideration by the Committee in a probing sense rather than in any real desire to see his words being taken literally and enacted in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Gentleman the Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) in what he had to say about that aspect of the matter. I noted, too, the criticisms that were made by two of the hon. Members for Havering—the hon. Members for Romford (Mr. Neubert) and Upminster (Mr. Loveridge). t struck me that there was an incredible amount of interest being displayed in the Companies (No. 2) Bill by the population of Havering. I wondered for a moment where my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Williams) was. I gather that he did not have the success that the two other hon. Gentlemen had in persuading the Whips to put them on to the Committee on this Bill. I have no doubt that the people of Havering at this time speak of little else However, the criticisms that the hon. Gentlemen made were not necessarily one with which I would wholly agree. I will say a little more about that in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Gentleman the Member for Kensington would agree that the value of his contribution at the last sitting and this has been to give publicity to the ideas which he holds. That is good, if it encourages a wider diSCussion of those ideas, but it really would be folly for the Government to seek to enact the proposals without very full consultation and diSCussion. Indeed, it is my view, although I know that the hon. Gentleman the Member for Kensington does not wholly agree with this—I will say something more about this in due course—that it would be folly to enter into substantial company legislation dealing with the responsibilities and obligations of companies to their work force, to the community at large, and so on, till one has had the opportunity of considering the views which will be expressed by the Bullock Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's proposals are based on the assertion, with which I entirely agree, that management of companies leaves a lot to be desired. That is one of the basic reasons why we have gone ahead with Bullock, and why we want to make the representation of workers on the boards a meaningful representation—not just paying lip service to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0703">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>65</span>
this concept. I would go much further than the hon. Gentleman the Member for Caernarvon and say that it is not only in the interests of the company itself and the work force within that company: it is in the interests of making democracy itself a better and more viable proposition in an age when democracy is under attack all too often, and sometimes, perhaps, with a measure of justification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main effect of the hon. Gentleman's variety of proposals—I am sorry if in a sense I treat them as an amalgam, because that is not entirely doing justice to him—is to require major companies to appoint three non-executive directors to make an annual statement to shareholders on the management of the company and the use of its assets. Those are the ideas he put forward originally. As I say, he has now refined them and developed them. He is to be commended for that, because his ideas cannot be condemned as being stereotyped. He is now proposing that the roll of the auditor be strengthened by imposing on some of the non-executive directors responsibility for matters concerning the audit and thereby improving the supervision of company management. He said during the EEC debate we had the other day that he saw the audit committee as a naSCent supervisory board. He has developed these arguments to the Committee on Tuesday and today. He wants the practice of the audit to be built on; he wants a new role to be given to non-executive directors in this connexion; he wants to see the SCope of the audit enlarged so that the audit should have regard, as he puts it, not only to the historic situation and the present situation but also to the future, and so that it will involve employees. I stress that point in view of remarks I want to make later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman complains that our proposals do not do that. He is right in that regard. He says that the Bill should enable the services of the auditor to be made more expansive to bring forward a much more effective supervisory service for the shareholders and employees whom he has defined together as the stakeholders of the company. I take it he meant those two terms—shareholders and employees—to be construed together coniunctively in the word " stakeholders". He pleads the rele-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
vance, in consideration of all these ideas, of the German system and the operation in Ontario of audit committees, as something to which this Committee and the House should give attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe this approach to be very interesting and, as I have said, very constructive, but only as a basis for diSCussion. I am not sure that he would wish to assert that there has been sufficient thought in depth about what really would be involved in the implementation of the totality of his proposals. Those are the points that have been made in their short contributions by the two hon. Members from Havering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the nature of the audit, and the role of the non-executive directors, what in practice does he have in mind to be the responsibility of the auditors? Is it right that they should assume these tasks? Do they have the necessary qualifications so to do? Clearly, it would be wrong to implement legislation unless and until these ideas are further developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for audit committee, it is quite right that these matters are being pursued in practice in Ontario, but I think he would agree that it is a little early to make an evaluation of the results of an experiment that is certainly very limited in time. As for our own experience in the United Kingdom, it is far too early to come to any reasonable diagnosis of the value of such limited experiments as have been made. There is always a danger, anyway. when one looks to experience abroad, in saying, " We do well to ape experience and experiments that have been conducted abroad". There is always a danger in draftipg provisions in our law on that basic. particularly. I would have thought. where there has been inadeouatp time to carry out a proper evaluation of the experiments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There can be absolutely no doubt that the proposals the hon. Gentleman has nut to the Committee are germane to the issue of the responsibility of directors. Certain non-executive directors are to be given special responsibilities regarding the supervision of the company's financial affairs. T do not dispute that there is a role for non-executive directors, but T would like to take up the point that was rehearsed by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Upminster by asking, should these non-executive directors, members

of the audit committee, be given responsibilities that are not shared by other directors? Is that the right way to progress these ideas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not right to think of this special group of directors having a special responsibility in regard to matters affecting liquidity, and that they would be obliged to go into such matters with the auditors and then convey their knowledge to the other directors? We have had cases of large companies collapsing due to lack of foresight over liquidity matters. This is where my hon. Friend's suggestion might have value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not involve total responsibility. I fear that under the hon. Gentleman's proposals there is a risk of that situation occurring. I think that that worried the hon. Gentleman in his previous contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was my anxiety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not for me to clarify the position for the hon. Gentleman? I am sure that the hon. Member for Kensington will take those observations into account when he sums up the debate from his point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that all directors should share responsibility for the rectitude of a company's dealings and for its financial well being. I should not wish to see that form of responsibility whittled down or adulterated. The hon. Gentleman's point did not commend itself to the CBI in giving evidence to the Bullock Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wisdom of delegating functions will require careful consideration. I should not wish to jump into either condemnation of or support for that proposal without giving it much wider and more careful attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman must appreciate this. I know that it has not altogether suited his argument that he should do so. The ideas which he has canvassed over a period have received tepid support from Governments. It is not unnatural that he should be impatient. I make no complaint about that. The Bullock Committee is directly concerned with the supervision of management and the responsibility of directors. That committee is due to report by the end of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
the year. I quote from the terms of reference used by the then Secretary of State for Trade my right hon. Friend the Member for Stepney and Poplar (Mr. Shore). They read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Having regard to the interests of the national economy, employees, investors and consumers, to analyse the implications of such representations for the efficient management of companies and for company law."</p></blockquote>
It is impossible to accept the proposition advanced by the hon. Gentleman that his suggestion should be considered in a totally isolated way from the considerations of the Bullock Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that lithe Bullock Committee should report by the end of the year. Will he give an undertaking that the Government will bring forward legislation in the next parliamentary year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The then Minister of State, Department of Employment, the present Secretary of State for Employment, gave an undertaking, when the Industrial Democracy Bill was being considered, that legislation would be introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must carefully consider the implications of the Bullock Committee's recommendations. There must be careful consideration on both sides of industry, where total harmony has not prevailed in the evidence presented. These matters must be carefully considered by the Government and all parties concerned. It follows that the question of supervision is at stake. On Tuesday hon. Gentleman chided me—I do not say that he rebuked me; that would be going too far—for saying that we should await the outcome of the Committee's deliberations. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When there is an urgent problem to be dealt with Members of Parliament owe it to the country to get on with it, even if a high-powered committee has been set up."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee C,</i> 29th June 1976; c. 46.]</p></blockquote>
If we did that we should necessarily invalidate the reasons for setting up that committee, which is deliberating carefully on a mass of evidence, some of which is contradictory. We should not deprive the committee of the opportunity to offer a view without the Government having prejudged the situation. That would be wholly unacceptable and undesirable.

Gentleman and their politeness, gave the hon. Gentleman a degree of acclamation at the end of his recent contributions. However, I do not believe that they share his views. They have reservations on them. If they shared his views I have no doubt that they would have devoted a Supply Day to the diSCussion of these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to take up a point made by the hon Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins). We regret that he is not present today, although his absence is for good reasons. I assume that he asked for a Supply Day but had insufficient influence over the Leader of the Opposition and the Shadow Leader of the House. Their choices for Supply Days recently have left some room for improvement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman visited me. We had a fruitful and harmonious diSCussion, although I was not able to meet him on his Companies Bill, for reasons which I thought he well understood. I invited the hon. Gentleman to tender evidence to the Bullock Committee. I do not know whether he has done so. I hope that he has. I am glad that that has been done. t will enable his ideas to be advanced in the House and considered in depth by the Bullock Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having offered these reflections to the Committee I should not wish to throw out the proposals without proper consideration being given to them, in consideration in depth. They need to be widely diSCussed in the community. They should be diSCussed by professional organisations, which should be given a full opportunity to present their considered views about these matters. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel it appropriate that the proposals should not be included in the Bill and that he will, therefore, accordingly withdraw them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's ears must be tingling with pleasure at the wide publicity given to his proposals in the Press yesterday and also at the commendations he has received from both sides of the Committee on the diligence and care he has given now and in the past to the subject of company law. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
Minister said that this was a somewhat eclectic subject. Not many of our colleagues find it a matter of great interest. It is, therefore, extremely refreshing that my hon. Friend should bring an original mind and original thoughts to the question of the reform of company law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of us thinks that company law can stand still. Many of us regret that the process of change has not gone more quickly. It is refreshing, therefore, to have the opportunity, by means of my hon. Friend's amendments, to look for a moment at the direction in which company law is being reformed, the changing nature of the responsibilities of members of boards, and the changing nature of the relationship of members of boards to shareholders, employees, creditors and consumers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In moving his amendment my hon. Friend referred to the fact that the audit committee is now known in Ontario. There is a precedent, therefore, for the ideas that he has put forward in these amendments. The idea of the audit committee is now much more widely known and accepted. It is becoming established practice, as advised by the Securities and Exchange Commission and by the United States Institute of Certified Accountants. In a pamphlet which they put out recently, Price Waterhouse put forward the basic format on which an audit committee, composed of non-executive directors, should operate, the number of meetings in the year, the type of agenda it should have at each meeting, and the number of times the directors should meet the auditors. This shows the degree to which, in other parts of the world, there is a sophisticated approach to management and the responsibilities of boards, and illustrates that the idea of an audit committee is accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore I do not think that my hon. Friend's ideas are quite as revolutionary or as novel as the popular and serious Press may have led us to believe yesterday. I agreed with the Minister when he commented that a matter such as this requires a great deal of diSCussion and consultation before becoming law. I am in considerable sympathy with the idea of the audit directors and an audit committee composed of non-executive directors meeting with the auditors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stand aside from my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0706">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
Williams) in one important respect. I see the audit committee, if it came into being, as primarily a vehicle by which non-executive directors would meet with auditors to look at figures, the financial management of the company and the liquidity, and satisfy themselves that the financial resurces available to the company were being used properly and to the best possible advantage. Perhaps my hon. Friend will elaborate on this matter when he winds up. I do not see how auditors are qualified to look ahead at trends in the company's business. I think that it is their prime duty to see that the published accounts of the company reflect a true and fair view of the company's financial results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is much to be gained from a group of directors sitting regularly with the auditors being satisfied that the financial management of the company, and the use of its financial resources, are being handled properly. The composition of the body which sits down with the auditors should be that of the non-executive directors, as management—the executive directors—is inevitably involved. The executive directors already have a 	<i>partipris</i> in what is being done with the financial resources of the company. The non-executive directors by definition may be more objective. They do not take the decision downstream to invest so much of the company's capital in this or that project. They stand back and look at the overall financial results in a boardroom sense. It is on the basis of those who have an objective view meeting with the professionals that the audit committee is being so widely popularised and adopted by some of the biggest and most successful companies in North America.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend asked a rhetorical question. He asked why we need to legislate in this manner at a time when all companies are overburdened with detailed legislation. To me, the reason for looking further at the idea of audit committees—accepting the difference in emphasis that I have already mentioned—is that I accept that the balance of power in many joint stock companies is at the moment somewhat too much tilted in favour of managament rather than of the stakeholders in the company. An audit committee reporting to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
board, and writing a separate report in the company report and accounts, may give a more direct reply to the stakeholders as to how the funds, the cash flow of the company, and being used than at present happens. In this way it could act when necessary as a countervailing check within the board on the power of management. To this degree non-executive directors with the directors in an audit committee can provide a balance when on occasions the management cannot see the wood for the trees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see an audit committee developing as a two-tier supervisory board. I see it as something quite separate, and much more fulfilling the functions I have deSCribed, and tilting the balance in our joint stock companies back a bit in favour of the stockholders. My hon. Friend the Member for Rom-ford (Mr. Neubert) referred to the cost of this exercise and pointed out that non-executive directors, in being given this added responsibility, would naturally expect to be paid more. I would like to leave with him the thought that if we were to go along this line, rather than the line of the two-tier board structure—and I am purposely not touching on the question of employee participation—we would be making use of existing machinery and the existing boardroom set-up. This would cost considerably less than moving over to a two-tier supervisory board set-up with all the paraphernalia that that would involve, with more directors, offices, secretaries, accountants and all the support work any director requires. I can see the audit committee developing as a pragmatic answer to the questions posed during this debate, and making the best possible use of the machinery that exists at present, at far less cost than moving wholeheartedly over the the two-tier board supervisory machinery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) referred to it as a cosmetic exercise. Thinking in terms of employee par. ticipation and directors he might fairly use those words, but I would put to him that, quite apart from consideration of employee directors and participation, this thought of my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington, is a worthwhile exercise in considering how the control and information available about the funds within

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>73</span>
the company can better be supervised at the present time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might clarify what I meant when I said cosmetic. I was referring to this in the whole context of the debate on two-tier boards and nominating, perhaps, one or two employee directors to a board. I was not specifically referring to the detailed proposals in these amendments, which are, I believe, steps in the right direction. Without going a considerable way down the road to a situation of majority control by employees, the reality of transfer of power will not occur, and any directors who do represent employees will be in a difficult position and out on a limb. They will not be regarded either as representatives of the employees or in control of the board. As a result we would get the worst of all worlds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is leading us into an argument which we shall have many times in the months ahead and in the coming Session if the Under-Secretary's promise that we shall have legislation following Bullock in that Session comes to fruition. However this is a way of dealing with some of the existing pimples and it is worth while looking at it in depth in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister asked whether non-executive directors should be given responsibilities not shared with other directors. While I believe strongly that all the members of a board have a collective responsibility to all the stakeholders for all the interests in the company—and this is a major problem which Bullock will have to look at—they at the moment all have different responsibilities and functions to perform. One will always find committees being formed within the boards to look at particular problems. I do not think that would be a major problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the opportunity my hon. Friend has given us to look at this question. I hope we shall have an opportunity to consider it further, perhaps after Bullock, and I would thank him again for bringing these matters to our attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would start by thanking all my colleagues and the Minister for the attention they have given to my proposals and for an extremely valuable morning. It has been useful
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>74</span>
to have the reactions from the Department and from my colleagues. It will help me very much to formulate proposals which, I hope, may fit in, in due course, with the recommendations of the Bullock Committee. I was not under the impression, when I tabled all these amendments, that the Government would take them as they stood and embody them enthusiastically into the Bill, but the Minister has gone a long way to show that the Department is alive to the implications and not simply in a state of coma. I was under the impression it was. If that was a false impression I would like to apologise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was, under the administration of our predecessors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may contradict the Minister, that cannot be borne out if one looks through the detailed recommendations made to the House on the important Bill introduced in 1973 and which so tragically never got to Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Returning to the audit committee and the proposals I have made, I recognise that these proposals are in the nature of diSCussion papers. I am gratified by the extent to which they have attracted attention outside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to say one or two things about my earlier Bills just to convince the Committee that I am not entirely without humour and not totally dedicated to company law reform to the exclusion of all other considerations. In 1969 the first Companies Bill I introduced was of a highly experimental character and it soon became obvious in Committee that it would be almost impossible to draft it in such a way that it would prove a workable piece of law. What made it a big step forward in the campaign for company law reform was that the Government were obliging enough to allow room for the impression to be formed that it was likely to go through. This concentrated the minds of management and professional bodies wonderfully, and gave rise to an absolute storm of protest; many hundreds of pounds must have been spent on telegrams to Conservative Central Office and other places mandating all concerned to have the Bill stopped at any price. I knew from the start that it was not going to go through, but I was happy that it attracted so much attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0708">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>75</span>
Then, I think, in 1972, I managed to convince the Conservative Government that it would be fruitful to have a Committee stage for my Bill which, by then, was in a much more workmanlike form, having had the benefit of the assistance of the Department in its drafting. That was another leap forward in drawing the attention of the professions, management and students of company law to the need for reform. I hope the work I have done in Committee on this Bill will also prove a leap forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely echo what the Minister said in that we must not just copy other countries but evolve our own system. I am not enamoured of the idea that we should leap straight into the two-tier board formula. I hope the Bullock Committee will not recommend that, because it would be running before we are ready to walk. That does not mean we have got to do nothing. If in this Committee we have only succeeded in arousing interest and attention and awakening joint stock company managements all over the country to the possibility that their functions can be carried out more efficiently we have done something useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the question whether the role of non-executive directors should be defined, and whether they should have responsibilities not shared by other directors, I am not in sympathy with what the Minister said. In large organisations directors have to specialise. If one looks at the boards of British companies one will find, for example, a commercial director, or perhaps the commercial function may itself be even more specialised—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not intending to convey the impression that some degree of delegation of responsibility is not essential. Of course, it is, but it is the collective responsibility for complying with the requirements of company law that must not in any sense be whittled down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This question of not splitting the board has given concern when people have been looking at my own Companies Bill. It seemed to them that round the same table one would have executive and non-executive directors and, because of the doctrine of col lective responsibility, the non-executive directors would be obliged to take part in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>76</span>
all the deliberations of the board and be committed by its decisions. Afterwards, however, they would be given the role of going to the shareholders to talk about the board and to comment on the decisions taken as though they had had no part in them all along. This double role has jarred on some people. I understand their reservations. In the later versions of my Bill I have suggested that non-executive directors should not have votes, since it is only on relatively rare occasions that votes are actually taken and it could be said that they would be bound by the collective decision of the board. I realise that is not the final solution but only a talking point. The Minister went too far in his objections to the delegation of functions and specialisation of the functions of directors. I am glad he intervened. If we look at North American practice we see the way in which large boards, consisting often of a majority of non-executive directors are split up into committees with different functions of which the audit committee is only one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should this Bill go into law more or less as it stands without the changes in direction I am suggesting for the auditors, I consider it would be a decided setback. I can understand the Minister saying that without giving the Bullock Committee an opportunity to report we cannot make any major leaps forward. But at any rate, we do not have to go in the wrong direction. It seems to me that the Bill, as it stands, is obsolete in its thinking and will actually be an unfortunate development in company law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dealing briefly with some of my hon. Friend's points I come first to the cost of the operation. I do not think we need to be too afraid of the salaries which would have to be paid to non-executive directors. Almost all the large companies have one, two, three or four non-executive directors already, though I do not think they normally pay them enough. There is a saying in personnel management "If you pay peanuts you only attract monkeys". The sort of rôle I envisaged would certainly deserve £5,000 a year and a man able to do this work would not be able to take on more than two, three or four such jobs at most. One would want such a person to be in a position to resign if he wanted
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0709">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>77</span>
to, and well paid enough to sustain himself if he came into conflict with the rest of the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another question was, where these people were to come from. We are dealing only with about the largest 1,000 or 2,000 companies, many of which already have non-executive directors. Perhaps the majority are already people who could fulfil without much trouble the functions I see for audit directors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neubert</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was there not the suggestion in what my hon. Friend said and in what subsequently was said in diSCussion that the non-executive director's role would have to be extended to take account of increased responsibilities and that, therefore, it is not strictly correct to say there would be the same number of people occupied as at present, if my hon. Friend's proposal were adopted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We want people to operate more effectively. Many of them are not the right people, but I do not say that we need a boardroom purge or a major reshuffle. I do not believe in sudden change. We have to evolve from what we have, in the way the audit committees develop and people with extended responsibility begin to exert themselves more. We cannot tell them all what they have to do. That is the wrong approach. They must work it out for themselves. We must set up the joint stock companies in the way in which they can best develop their method of business for themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neubert</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt further, but my hon. Friend does not seem to have seen my point. Does it not follow from what he proposes that more will be demanded of the non-executive director as an audit director than is demanded at present? Will not such men have to take fewer posts? Will not more people have to be drafted in?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true that to be an audit director is approaching towards a full-time occupation, and no one should attempt to do more than two or three of these jobs. I wonder sometimes how much people give to their companies when they have 40 or 50 directorships. I agree that I am looking to the drafting of a certain number
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
of people into companies and giving them a bigger responsibility and more opportunity, but the operation is not on a large SCale and would involve some thousands at most.

I am convinced that British industry breeds in middle life a large number of people who could easily train themselves to carry out this work. The policy of organising management in the shape of a pyramid, with a small number of senior posts and many junior posts, means that people work themselves out of junior positions, but have nowhere to go. That is an aspect of joint stock companies which is outside this Bill and I shall not pursue it; but the system breeds many people with experience of responsibility in joint stock company administration and management who find in middle life that they have nowhere to go. If only as few as one out of 10 were suitable for the supervisory role I envisage, then we should have no shortage of talent or experience, but we have to look to the market upon which such people can place themselves because there is no demand for them, or, if there is, it does not yet express itself effectively. If such a provision as this were enacted, I am confident that within a short time that problem would solve itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a serious question whether a move of this kind would tend to change the balance between those engaged in the production of wealth and, increasing even more, the numbers of those engaged in watching them. There are too many watchers and not enough creators in our society, and I do not want in any way to increase the number of those who watch and decrease the number of those who do. I agree about that: but if we asked a football team to match an opposing side but placed the players all wrong, however good they might be and however hard they played they would probably not win. If we put British managers to compete under our obsolete joint stock company formula and ask to play the Japanese, the Germans and the French and others, we are not giving them a chance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Few top executives of British industry feel fully stretched. Because of the way they are organised, they are not able to make the contribution of which they feel capable. Joint stock companies have got themselves in a jam and allow a terrible

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>79</span>
waste of top talent in the way they work. One way of reducing that waste and strengthening the supervisory element—but not increasing the number of idle hands—is to enable those at work to make the best of themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Caernarvon, absorbed in the move to worker participation, feels that what I am suggesting is only cosmetic and is, perhaps, a distraction or an irrelevance. In my Companies' Bill I suggested that a company might appoint an equal number of employees to co-operate with the non-executive directors and to participate in non-executive directors' meetings. In doing so I was trying to take note of the increasing wish to find forms for worker participation to go forward. In the audit committee provision, in New Clause 1 I have a similar provision, but I did not spell it out so specifically because I did not want to be accused by the Minister of trespassing on the work of the Bullock Committee, so I left it vague.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am convinced that in moving to forms of worker participation, the efficiency of the company will still matter very much. Whatever develops, we must still have a system which enables large companies to work effectively, Management, workers and shareholders will have to have the data and the power to make sure that their companies are working happily and fruitfully. Although the driver of a car or the person who owns the car is important, the car itself has to be well designed. Equally, we have to strike a new and effective balance between the executive and the supervisory role in management.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to bore the Committee with a dissertation on the history of the Welsh language, but it may be relevant for hon. Members not conversant with the situation in W ales to be made familiar with the background which requires the provisions made in New Clause 13, and Amendment No. 8. They represent a real requirement in Wales, certainly in the Welsh-speaking parts of Wales. Hon. Members may not be familiar with the idea that Welsh is very much a living language. In my constituency it is spoken by 87 per cent. of the people and 37 out of 39 election meetings I held at the last General Election were in Welsh entirely. Two-thirds of my constituency correspondence comes in Welsh, and as a test my secretary has brought in this morning's post. Out of 15 letters, 12 are in Welsh. That shows the reality of the situation of Welsh in day-to-day life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is as valid for companies as for any other form of life. In the past six or seven years a number of companies of which I know—there may be some of which I do not know—have tried to register their titles in Welsh with " cyfyngedig " for " limited " or " cyf " for " Ltd " and have run into trouble. Some use the Welsh form, although it is not strictly legal, on their letterheads, and if someone chose to take note there could be embarrassment in some directions. This was recognised by the Conservative Government in their 1973 measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 8 is very much a probing amendment. I propose putting in " or Welsh " after " English " to probe the Government as to the applicability of the Hughes-Parry report of 1965 and the Welsh Language Act 1967 to Welsh company law. Hughes-Parry investigated the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>84</span>
legal situation of Welsh. The recommendation was for a policy of bilingualism. My party and others recommended a policy of equal validity. Equal validity means that anything done in one language has the same force in law as if it were done in the other. If anything is done in Welsh only it has total validity without translation. If it has to he translated it is bilingualism, which Hughes-Parry recommended. The Welsh Language Act provided equal validity in law administration in Wales. There are courts which sit using the Welsh language, and those who wish to give evidence can do so in Welsh, and that is regarded as having validity, as if it were given in English. The same provisions extend to certain other spheres of life although the full report of Hughes-Parry was not implemented hi the 1.967 Act. This clause with this amendment would mean that if one says it in Welsh it has equal validity. If, as in the other amendments and the new SChedule, translation is required into English, recognition is implied of the principle of bilingualism and not of equal validity. The implication can be far reaching.

I think that Members of the Opposition will see a certain similarity between my proposals in New Clause 13 and certain provisions in the measure of 1973. That is not totally gratuitous. Indeed, the provisions of the 1973 Bill were a significant step in the right direction. In bringing forward this new SChedule I thought that I would be able to gain the support of Members on this side of the Committee, seeing that I was framing it in the same terms as those of the 1973 Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have put forward their own new clause subsequent to my publishing my New Clause 13. The Government's New Clause 16 is, by and large, along the same lines, but with one or two significant differences. The differences appear in subsections (3), (4) and (5) and it would appear that the Government do not accept the application of Welsh forms in all instances, but only in one of the three instances that I have put forward in my new SChedule. It may be that my interpretation of the Government's new clause is mistaken, but I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on this matter.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0713">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>85</span>
If it is a matter of wording and the objective is exactly the same I would be only too happy to accept the Government's proposal, and to thank them for meeting us on this matter. This is a small matter, of interest to a certain limited number of people, but it is a matter of much aggravation to people who are Welsh speaking in Wales and to those companies which desire to use the Welsh language.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Member tell us a little about the new SChedules? I am very interested in reading the Welsh equivalent of " limited company " and the English short version of "public limited company"—"plc." Is the hon. Member proposing in the new form of statutory incorporation of the English limited company that will be the equivalent to the EEC public limited company, and it will then have—I will not try to tackle pronunciation of the Welsh version—"p.l.c." after it? I am not aware of " p.l.c." for English public limited company at the moment. I wonder whether the hon. Member is trying to copy the EEC in this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention. I am sure that the development in the EEC was very much in the minds of the hon. Gentleman's colleagues who drew up this SChedule for the 1973 Bill. I have picked this up strictly from the 1973 Bill put forward by his own colleagues. This wording is identical with that. I imagine that was in their minds. That is quite conceivable. Obviously it is "limited". That is the most important, and that is in the Government's new clause. I would imagine that would be the rationale put forward by the Government on this matter, but I will listen to what the Minister has to say on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion I would say that people in Wales will welcome the Government's flexibility in meeting us—not all the way, but a long way down the road. The companies involved, I am certain, would take advantage of the provisions, which would make life easier for the people who have an interest in these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Law Officers' Department (Mr. Arthur Davidson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman has indicated, the Government's new clause is designed to regularise the position of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>86</span>
the Welsh language under the Companies Acts. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will find that it covers his points, cr almost ail his points. Perhaps I can explain what the new clause does, and I apologise if I do it in some detail, but I think that the hon. Gentleman did ask for its full implications. Perhaps I can deal with what the Government regard as defective in his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) provides that a company incorporated after the clause becomes law may in its memorandum of association indicate that its registered office is to be situated in Wales. At present the Companies Act 1948 requires the company to indicate whether the office is situated in England or in SCotland. That was in 1948, before the enactment of the Welsh Language Act to which the hon. Gentleman referred. England then, in statutes, meant England and Wales and the expression has the same meaning in a company's memorandum of association. The subsection reflects the philosophy of the Welsh Language Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) provides that a company incorporated before the clause comes into effect can by special resolution amend its memorandum to indicate that the registered office is to be situated in Wales. Without this provision, a memorandum of association could not be so altered, as the situation of the registered office is an aspect of the memorandum incapable of amendment by the company. The privilege conferred by the subsection can only be invoked within 12 months of the clause's entry into effect, as this should be a once and for all change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) provides that where a limited company, after the clause enters into effect, has in its memorandum a statement that the registered office is to be situated in Wales, it may adopt a name with " cyfyngedig ", the Welsh name for " limited ", instead of the word " limited " required by the Companies Act 1948. I hope my pronunciation is correct. I did do a certain amount of rehearsing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neubert</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister say that again?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Cyfyngedig. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman must know that that is the Welsh for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0714">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>87</span>
"limited". Everyone knows that. Cyf. as I am reminded, is the short abbreviated term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4) provides that a company whose registered office is stated in the memorandum to be situated in Wales may change its name by special resolution without the consent of the Secretary of State, normally required under Section 18(1) of the Companies Act 1943, if the change consists only of the substitution of "cyfyngedig " for "limited " or vice versa. This provision, inter alia, allows a Welsh company incorporated before the clause enters into effect to adopt an all Welsh name with cyfyngedig as the last word instead of "limited".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remaining subsections are largely consequential. I do not think that the Committee would want me to go into them in detail, although I would be quite happy to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the explanation the Minister has given,, and of the reasons for his turning down the versions I have put, as in the draft 1973 Bill, in the new SChedule. Could he explain the rationale behind selecting one of these three designations and not going for the other two? Does he regard " limited company " as being sufficiently broad to include other companies that may arise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman said, the text of his amendment was taken from the 1973 Bill. When I first saw it I wondered. I thought he had done it himself, and that it was an amazing bit of draftsmanship. As he freely acknowledged, it is taken from the 1973 Bill. It contained, and his text, therefore, contains, provisions relating to the designation of a company, as to whether it is to be private, or limited by guarantee, in its name. The Government agree with his proposals in principle, but the drafting is defective as it has been taken out of its original context. The 1973 Bill contained provisions dealing with the classification of companies and required companies to designate their status in their names. The new SChedule provided by the hon. Gentleman gives the Welsh equivalent of the English designations of status. However, this Bill does not require the use of such designations and, there-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>88</span>
fore, it would not be appropriate to have it. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the No. 8 and the question of equal validity. I accept them. I imagine that as and when further changes in company law are made—and there has been a reference to possible changes next year—there will be parallel amendments that could be made to provide for changes in terminology as they develop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made reference to my Amendment No. 8 and the question of equal validity. I appreciate that. I would hardly expect the Minister, specialising in this Committee, to be fully briefed on those implications. Therefore, I am not going to press Amendment No. 8. However, if he has comments on this, or his advisers have for him—on the applicability of equal validity—I would be pleased to hear them. If he does not have any comment I will assume that the Government are pressing ahead on company law at least with the learning towards bilingualism and equal validity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is quite right. Bilingualism is something that the Law Officers' Department is not normally concerned with. I think the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that I am not in any way decrying his concept of equal validity, but accounts will need to be used by people in England as well as in Wales and very few people in England understand the Welsh language. That may be their folly, but they do not. Equal validity in this case would not be appropriate. That is why the Government regard a translation as essential if accounts are to be comprehensible to all users.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that explanation. Indeed, that is our thinking on the matter. A bilingual policy might be better than a policy of equal validity. In Wales, the principle of bilingualism may be equally applicable, rather than the principle of equal validity. No doubt there will be opportunities to fellow that up on a more suitable occasion.

	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) A copy of the balance sheet and of any accounts required by this section to be so annexed shall, before being laid before the company in general meeting, be signed by all the directors of the company, save thal if for any reason the signature of a director cannot be obtained, the reason therefore shall be stated on the balance sheet."'</p></blockquote></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Members of the Committee will be glad to know that on this matter we are dealing with something that is much more technical and in the main line of this Bill, rather than just the Celtic fringes.

I do this because I believe that there is a very great danger of directors not being sufficiently closely identified with the legally required documentation that goes out in their names. A moment ago an hon. Member referred to the fact that sonic directors are directors of 40 companies. I cannot believe that people in that situation can be sufficiently 	<i>au fait</i> with the goings on in a company properly to put their names to accounts and reports. Yet they are the people being held responsible in law for what is happening in a company. I believe that if a requirement were that every director should be responsible for signing documents, he would be taking personal responsibility. That requirement would do two things. Firstly, it might cut down the number of those directors who are only nominal and not taking an active part in the company. Secondly, those who do retain an interest in the company and sign documents will have to take much more interest in the documents submitted and what they really stand for.

In the past two or three years some companies have gone to the wall. We
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>90</span>
have seen one or two directors embarrassed as they have not known what was going on within their companies. I do not follow any personal interest or benefit, but I believe that the responsibilities carried by directors are heavy. That should be formally recognised. I believe thatthis amendment would be a useful addition to the body of company law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a great deal of sympathy for what the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) has said. I should like to speak to Amendment No. 94, which requires that
	<br><blockquote><p>"A copy of the balance sheet and of any accounts required by this section to be so annexed shall, before being laid before the company in general meeting, be signed by all the directors of the company, save that if for any reason the signature of a director cannot be obtained, the reason therefore shall be stated on the balance sheet."</p></blockquote>
The purposes of Amendments Nos. 94 and No. 9 are essentially the same. We wish to identify each director of a company specifically and clearly with the important documents that are produced by the company. It is in the public interest that every director should be identified in this way and that his responsibilities should be clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only difference between the hon. Member for Caernarvon and myself is one of degree. Many documents are filed with the Registrar but are in effect formalities. They are filed purely from the point of view of keeping the records of the company up to date. I do not think that some of these documents are sufficiently significant as to require the signatrate the minds of directors, especially it be in the public interest if it were required that they should receive the signature of every director. A director might say " Here is another document going to the Registrar which I must sign". He would sign it without too much thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is more important that Section 155(1) of the Companies Act 1948 should be amended and that the balance sheet and accounts of the company should no longer be signed by only two directors of the company, which is the present state of the law, but that they should be signed by every director. That would concentrate the minds of directors, especially, of large boards and large companies,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0716">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>91</span>
where at present one executive director is concerned with one division of the company's activities. Perhaps the first occasion when he sees the consolidated accounts for the year in their final form is at the final board meeting when they are approved. He may be a director of a large board composed of 25 or 30 members. He may be satisfied with the reputation and diSCretion of his colleagues. He may inquire no further. In those circumstances the documents are probably signed either by the chairman, the managing director or the financial director. The individual executive director does not inquire much further. If it were necessary to obtain the signature of every individual director to the balance sheet and accounts when they were laid before the company's general meeting, that would concentrate the mind of every director. It would cause them to ask more questions about the accounts. It would also make their responsibilities to the public, the employees and every stakeholder in the company utterly clear, as they would have to put their names to the document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is against that background that my hon. Friends and I tabled Amendment No. 94, which we hope will commend itself to the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support Amendment No. 94. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) is right in saying that if all the documents had to be signed by all the directors, there is a danger that the directors would rapidly develop the habit of signing rows of papers without dwelling on what they were doing. When it came to more important papers such as the balance sheet they would do the same without thinking. Amendment No. 94 is beneficial. If it were accepted it would force all directors to think about the true meaning underlying the accounts, as their signatures would go on the specific document. If they sign everything they will never have that same feeling. I therefore welcome and support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful, before dealing with the comments made in support of the amendments, if I rehearsed the effect of the present provisions of company law in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>92</span>
Sections 149, 150 and 157 of the 1948 Act make it an offence for any director to fail to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the accounts, group accounts and directors' reports respectively comply with the requirements concerning the form and content of these documents. That is an essentially relevant provision in the light of what the Opposition have said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sections 155 and 156 of the Act require the balance sheet to be signed on behalf of the board by two of the directors, or by the director if there is only one, and require the board to approve the profit and loss account and the group accounts annexed to the balance sheet, before the balance sheet is signed on their behalf. There is no doubt that the law currently defines the responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the two amendments is to bring home forcefully to the directors the measure of their personal responsibility for the contents of the documents delivered to the Registrar. I do not dissent from that principle, but I do not think that it is necessary. What advantage would be gained by requiring the documents to be delivered to the Registrar to be signed by all the directors? They all share the obligations and respnosibilities concerned with the accounts and the director's report. That was illustrated when I rehearsed the current law. The directors are all jointly and severally responsible for ensuring that they comply with the requirements of the Companies Acts. There is already a requirement that the accounts shall be signed by two directors or, if there is only one director, by that director alone. Therefore I question the point of requiring the other directors to sign these documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that there would be a considerable disadvantage, to which I ask the Committee to address its mind, if we required ail the directors to sign, as the hon. Gentleman asserted that they should.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would happen if a director were seriously ill or abroad? There is no doubt that that would result in considerable delays in filing accounts. That matter has already caused consternation in the House. When I recently divulged, in answer to a Parliamentary Question, the delays that occurred, there was widespread agitation. This proposal would exacerbate the position. After all, this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0717">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>93</span>
clause is designed to prevent that. I therefore ask for Amendment No. 9 to be rejected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 94 avoids the difficulty in the first amendment relating to the absence of one or more directors at the material time. The main objection is that it would provide an additional bureaucratic formality, which I thought that the Opposition were anxious to avoid. Some companies have more than two or three directors. Some have too many directors. As the hon. Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) said, how can people with 40 directorships undertake their job properly, or at all? Therefore I do not think that the extra bureaucratic functions which would follow from accepting this provision would be justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at the argument advanced by the Minister on Amendment No. 94. He referred to an extra bureaucratic function and more work. What would it involve? The accounts come before the board meeting to be approved. In these circumstances they would only need to be passed round the board meeting and signed by every director sitting at the table.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true. The directors must be there. If they were not there, the amendment provides that they must state a reason on the balance sheet. That is an additional bureaucratic formality. I imagine that a story book might have to be provided in some instances. This does nothing to assist the law as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neubert</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not give way now, although I do not want to prevent the people in Havering, from participating in this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the intention is that all directors must see the company accounts before they are published—which was the point made by the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton)—this amendment does not add anything. All directors share a collective responsibility at law for the accounts. They have collective responsibility for what appears in the directors' report. They have a collective responsibility for ensuring compliance with the requirements of the Companies Act. Most companies would not welcome the fanciful position wherein all
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>94</span>
directors would be required to peruse and consider the company accounts in depth because they had to subSCribe their hands to the documents. That does not offer any advantage on the present situation. I hope that in those circumstances the hon. Gentleman will not press his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I should like to know what consultation there has been on the amendment with professional bodies, companies, chambers of commerce and those directly concerned in the running of companies. I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman was duty bound to consult them, and that he should not put forward a suggestion willy-nilly. On the face of it I do not take exception to it in principle, but I should like to know whether this additional formality commends itself to those in business as adding anything to the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neubert</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister appears to be speaking in this matter from the letter of the law and not from life. t surprises me that he does not more clearly see the point behind my hon. Friend's amendment. It cannot have eSCaped his attention that in the popular Press, if not reports from the Department of Trade, there have been recent financial SCandals in which documents presented in accordance with the requirements of the Act, and apparently signed by members of the board, have been presented in a perfunctory and cursory way, often to the complete ignorance of other directors, who would not have wished to be associated with what those documents represented if they had known of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's suggestion appears to be reasonable. He is not proposing a massive and stringent burden on companies in respect of all their documentation and decisions that they take in the course of a commercial year. But in the case of this one principal, all-important document, all members of the board should be prepared to support it by their signatures or to explain why they have not done so—for reasons of absence and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this an intervention?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neubert</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I am being a little lengthy, but the Minister went on to finish his speech before he yielded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0718">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>95</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave way to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neubert</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I misunderstood the development of the Minister's argument. The hon. Gentleman spoke of those directors who held directorships in 40 or 50 companies. It is in this area that such practices take place, where minutes of apparent board meetings, or even general meetings, are produced, and which these directors have never seen. That may be their fault, but at least the Minister should be concerned in a matter of company law reform to institute an extra diSCipline. I should have thought that, given notice, we could produce a startling number of cases where such provision as this amendment allows would have had a beneficial effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I am saying is that I do not think that the amendment assists compliance with the law. This is what we are anxious to achieve. There is no gainsaying the fact that the law currently requires this joint and several liability)on. the part of all directors. If somebody is unable to attend the general meeting—frequently general meetings are marked by the absence of one or two people, to put it mildly, who should be there—his absence is noted. What good does that do? He is still liable—not a jot less liable—than those people who have signed the documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order that the argument may be fully considered, I should also put to the Committee the situation in which all the directors are required to sign a document. That is provided for by Section 41 of the Companies Act 1948, relating to the prospectus, which all directors are required to sign. The prospectus is issued for the purpose of inviting members of the public to invest in the company. All directors of the company are severally liable for any false or misleading statements which the prospectus contains. It is, therefore, necessary that a director who may incur such liability should sign, and presumably read carefully before signing, the prospectus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prospectus comes into a different category. I understand that this was a matter which came under consideration recently by at least the CBI and possibly other bodies, which felt that it would not add anything to the necessary compliance with company law but would add
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>96</span>
an extra bureaucratic formality, to little advantage. I am not particularly persuaded by the authority that I have cited, but it is right that I should draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we have dealt with the question of bureaucratic difficulties already. They do not exist in this instance. We are asking for everyone present at the board meeting to add his signature to a document that will be circulated to the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has been helpful in calling the attention of the Committee to the fact that on all prospectuses already every director is required to sign, because they are severally responsible for the contents of the prospectus. The Under-Secretary has told us that under the Companies Act every director is generally and collectively responsible for the contents of the published accounts. Why not make that responsibility crystal clear and remind every director of it every year at the relevant board meeting, by getting his signature on the document?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Lamond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support Amendment No. 94, which seems to be reasonable and practical. I am not convinced by the argument we have heard from my hon. Friend the Minister. While it may be true that a requirement to sign the accounts does not alter the legal situation of a director, there are many fields in life in which we are given reminders of the law which are not necessary in law. For instance, if one drives on the M74 from Glasgow to Carlisle one sees every few miles a notice saying "Heavy commercial vehicles please comply with the speed limits". It is not necessary to remind them. The speed limits are laid down by law. Drivers should know them, and if they exceed them they are liable to be prosecuted. The Minister of Transport, I suppose, thinks that it is a good idea to spend a considerable amount of money giving constant reminders over that lengthy stretch of road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many other examples of our being gently reminded of our liability under the law so that we can comply with it. The warning is not necessarily given because it has to be given, but as a means of ensuring that people comply, without our always having to take them to court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0719">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>97</span>
The necessity to sign a document once a year if a director is at the board meeting, which he should be if possible, is not an immense bureaucratic requirement. I agree that some people have many directorships. I do not think that the figure of 40 which has been given is an exaggeration. I am sure that we could even find people who are doing a full-time job in the House of Commons and are directors of many companies. If this simple requirement will make directors think about their responsibilities, I support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we find that the Opposition are putting the idea forward, I do not see why the Government should object to it. I do not see it as my function here to protect company directors. I want to see the Bill go through. My object in supporting the amendment is to try to see that directors carry out their duties. If that is supported—or even proposed, as in this instance—by members of the Opposition, why should we object to it? We should support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a matter which requires some deliberation on the part of those involved in businesses. I am not, in principle, opposed to the idea, as I said at the outset. I should like to think about it further and take soundings outside my Department about its value. I think that that would be to the advantage of both sides of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian Sedgemore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was very pleased to hear my hon. Friend the Minister speaking as he has just done, because my inclination is to support the Opposition amendment but to invite my hon. Friend to modify it a little.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the night that Court Line collapsed I spoke to the board of Court Line Aviation. I was astonished by their lack of knowledge of the financial affairs of that company. I cannot help believing that had all the directors of Court Line Aviation had to sign the accounts each year they would have known a lot more than they did about what was going on in their company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is a lawyer. That results in difficulties, because he thinks as a lawyer. Although his outline of the legal position was, as always, exemplary, and although his understanding of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>98</span>
law is exemplary, he did not seem to be speaking as a practical man. There is nothing like a signature for concentrating the mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if for any reason the signature … cannot be obtained, the reason therefore shall be stated on the balance sheet."</p></blockquote>
But the reason may be utterly trivial. There must be good grounds for not signing the balance sheet. Alternatively, we should, perhaps, introduce a penalty clause for directors who do not sign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong for my hon. Friend to think that he could simply come back in a few weeks' time and tell us that it is all very difficult, that the Chamber of Commerce, the CBI, or some other bodies do not like the amendment. If the Conservative Party likes it, though that may not be a reason for supporting it, we should not be trailing behind the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to sound a jarring note or to criticise the Department unduly, particularly in view of the Minister's open dealing with my long series of amendments earlier today, but our shout debate on this amendment shows how remote the Department is from what really goes on in companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder why the Minister has found it necessary to recount what one can only deSCribe as a Civil Service approach to join stock company management, when, if he draws on his own experience of life, I am sure that he must know that the business of putting one's name to a document forces one to think and reminds one of one's personal commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept, either, the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that a prospectus is in some way in a different category of importance from the annual balance sheet and profit and loss accounts. It would be a disastrous doctrine if the Department really sought to press it, because it would imply that, whereas in a prospectus one had to be SCrupulously accurate, for a balance sheet only a formality was required to be gone through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friends will press to a Division Amendment No. 94, because the Department clearly is not with it where companies are concerned. It is not sufficient to leave the matter
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0720">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>99</span>
to the Department to mull over and decide whether it might do something on Report. The Department ought not to have to think about well-canvassed proposals as though they had come as a bolt from the blue, but that seems to happen all too often.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This brings me back to the point where I started. The Department may not be in a coma concerning company law, but it is still in a very dozy condition. It should be paying attention to what reformers are saying and what professional bodies believe to be neces- sary, and not always taking refuge in the necessity for consultation, further consideration, longer study, whenever there is proposed in Parliament anything which has been the subject of comment and recommendation outside for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I hope either that the Minister will accept the amendment as it stands, or that we shall proceed to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that we are all that far apart. I have already indicated that in principle I accept a great deal of what has been said. Therefore, it may be helpful to examine whether the amendment is a credible proposition as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take up the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, West (Mr. Sedgemore). What the amendment requires is that a copy of the balance sheet shall be signed by all the directors of the company. If somebody is not present a reason has to be given. My hon. Friend rightly asked what was the sanction. It is no use importing into the law a requirement unless there is a penalty, a sanction, for non-compliance. Is there to be a crinimal sanction? Is somebody who fails to comply with this requirement to be prosecuted? If so, is it to be a summary offence, or is it to be one where there is a choice whether to be tried summarily or on indictment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens if no reason for absence is stated? What happens if the board is concerned that no communication has been received from a director stating his reason for absence? Till the board can be satisfied that there is a genuine
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>100</span>
reason, will it hold up the signature of, and filing of, the documents?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are those practical reasons which I did not go into because I thought it unnecessary to do so. There is genuine concern on the part of the Committee, but the hon. Gentleman's proposal is replete with problems. It cannot be an answer to the situation unless we examine with care the repercussive effects of introducing such a requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note the sensitivity of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. I should be foolish to ignore what they have said, and I shall not ignore it. I shall very carefully canvass both inside and outside my Department what criteria we should apply for considering these matters. Obviously, that will enable us to come hack to the matter on Report, and perhaps in consequence we shall have provisions inserted in the Bill which the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) did not begin to contemplate when he tabled the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Under-Secretary consider the possibility that there might be a way out of the difficulty by allowing, in certain circumstances, the secretary of the company to sign the name by proxy, rather in the way that a club secretary puts in the name of someone who has been proposed for the club? I can see that there are difficulties in that, but it might be a way out if a director were away for months exploring the Amazon or were sick and missing temporarily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That goes to show that the matter has not been very carefully thought out. The hon. Gentleman would invite a miSChief that would be worse than the present situation, which I do not think is defective in any material respect. I shall listen with interest to the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex, but I cannot see that it would be right to enable proxy provisions to apply. What the hon. Gentleman is concerned about is the question of sanctions, to which my hon. Friend and I have just alluded. He wants to skate out of the problem. That is most unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the House may ultimately wish the provision to be implemented, let us consider it further, but let us give force and body to the law. The amendment is no use as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neubert</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister concede that the present somewhat casual and limited requirement that he has deSCribed has giver cause, in recent financial SCandals, for criminal manipulation of smaller companies which do not have the elaborate, regular meetings of the board which are the subject of this diSCussion? For example, there is a case proceeding at the Old Bailey now concerning the right hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Stonehouse)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Crawshaw. I think that it would be quite improper to advert to any proceedings currently being litigated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is in order, but I advise the hon. Member not to proceed with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neubert</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All that I was seeking to do was to emphasise the point which the Minister seems not to wish to accept, that in recent cases, well published in the papers, there have been occasions when the formalities have been so limited that one director has been able, or two directors acting in concert have been able, without the knowledge of other directors, to manipulate those companies. I believe that what we propose is a reasonable diSCipline to institute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not exculpate the other directors from the effects of the law. It is perfectly possible, within the ambit of the present proposal, for the missing directors' signatures to be forged or for untrue reasons to be given for their absence. That would be a deviousness and duplicity which the law would punish, because the law already covers the point which the hon. Gentleman is making—that there has been a miSChief done behind the backs of other directors, or that names have been put on to documents of people who had not been there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always possible to find a tortuous reason why the law should never be changed for the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the hon. Members for Oldham, East (Mr. Lamond) and Luton, West (Mr. Sedgemore) for their support for Amendment No. 94. I was surprised to find the Under-Secretary starting off by objecting to it—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not to the principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>102</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first speech made by the Under-Secretary in reply was one of objection in principle. It was only when he recognised the feelings of the Committee that he quickly tried to make a somersault.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to make clear the responsibility that already lies on the directors under company law. I find it astonishing that the Under-Secretary should not wish to identify himself with that motive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Luton, West, had one objection to the drafting of the amendment, which was that a trivial reason could be given for a director's not being present and, therefore, not signing. So be it. If a trivial reason were reported, all the more reason why the shareholders would not wish to see that director remain on the board. If it were stated on the balance sheet that a director did not sign the balance sheet because he was in Monte Carlo, or at a TUC Conferenee, it would be up to the stakeholders in the business to decide the following year whether they wished to reelect him to the board. Therefore, the amendment as drafted could result in great pressure on directors to make certain that they were present at the board mseting when they had to sign.

The main reason that the Under-Secretary found, at the last fence, for objecting to the amendment was that no sanctions were imposed by our amendment on directors who did not sign, or on the company which failed to follow the new subsection (4). Subsection (2) of Section 156 (2) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any accounts so annexed shall be approved by the board of directors before the balance sheet is signed on their behalf."</p></blockquote>
In that subsection there is no sanction, no penalty. In the drafting of subsection (4) we have followed the pattern of the existing subsection (2).

The Under-Secretary has put forward a mere device for not accepting the amendment. I heartily commend the amendment to the Committee, and suggest to my hon. Friends that we take the matter to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is incorrect. There is a sanction in Section 156(3). t would be unwise for this amendment, without any sanction, to be imposed. I have undertaken to give full consideration to the matter, but I

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wrigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a valuable debate. I accept at once that the Conservative amendment is better than mine. I take some comfort in the thought that mine may have triggered a few thoughts in that direction.

The rationale put forward by the Minister is incredible. To say that the signatures are necessary on a prospectus but not on accounts does not hold water. Surely, much more attention is given when a prospectus is issued, and everybody is aware of the risks. The real danger is that when accounts are being signed people are beginning to take things for granted, things are ticking over, and it is much easier for a director, or two directors working in collusion, to take people along with them.

There are provisions in Section 156(3) of the Companies Act for a fine of £50. I should have thought that it is possible to make that £50 fine equally applicable here. Indeed, on first reading I should have thought that it would be. It would not take very much to amend the section to that extent.

	<p>that there is a need for a change in the law on this matter. The assurances about discussing the matter outside are not strong enough. We should build the provision into the Bill at this stage, and then the Government can amend it if they find that a few of the commas are out of place or that the drafting is otherwise defective.</p>
	<p>For that reason, I support Amendment No. 94, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed:</i> No. 94, in page 3, line 37, at end add—

	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) A copy of the balance sheet and of any accounts required by this section to be so annexed shall, before being laid before the company in general meeting, be signed by all the directors of the company, save that if for any reason the signature of a director cannot be obtained, the reason therefore shall be stated on the balance sheet."'—[	<i>Mr. Tim Renton.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
