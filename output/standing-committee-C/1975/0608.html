	<li>declaring that a debtor's examination under section 15 of the Bankruptcy Act 1914 has been concluded; or</li>
	<li>dispensing with his examination under that section,</li></ol>
the court may, if it thinks fit, make an order directing that subsection (2) below shall have effect if he is or has been adjudged bankrupt in the proceedings; and in determining whether to make such an order the court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including in particular, any such facts as are stated in section 26(3) of the said Act of 1914 and whether the debtor has committed any offence under that Act or any other offence connected with his bankruptcy.</p></blockquote>

	<li>the adjudication is not annulled before that anniversary under section 21(2) or 29 of this Act,</li></ol>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In our last two sit- tings, the Minister spent a considerable time dealing with both the general and the particular points which arise on this group of amendments, and I think that he was right to do so. Clause 6 and the group of amendments and new clauses with which we are dealingis something
	<span class='label label-info column'>304</span>
new, something which has been discussed over many years as being desirable in principle, and something which will have important consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall attempt to respond to the manner in which the Minister dealt with this matter by dealing now with what seem to be the outstanding queries, some of which I know and and understand, and some of which he knows more aboutthan I do, because they may have been communicated direct to him by the working party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At our last sitting, I said that we were pleased that the Minister had seenlit in this part of the Bill to introduce such substantial changes. It shows the value of consultation. It shows that he has kept an open mind and hasbeen open to persuasion. I hope that he may be open to a little more persuasion before we finish with this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of what he has done, much has been achieved. We have now for the first time introduced into law what people have wanted for a long time—provisions for automatic discharge in certain circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is particularly interesting about this is that, the principlc having been conceded, we have achieved a new method which has in the past been referred to and which is now to be introduced. There were two main sets of recommendations prior to this. One was the Blagden recommendation which, with the assistance of the working party, we altered by changing the period of two years to five years, although the five years was not critical. The Justice Committee recommendations were different again, and what is being done now is yet another way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that we are all concerned about ensuring that, before we part with the Bill, we shall have the best possible formula for achieving what we all desire, and that, within the limits of that particular way of dealing with the matter, we get the wording as clear and as accurate as possible. It is reasonable to say that we have not cleared up everything yet, and I shall be directing my efforts towards seeing what remains to be cleared and then towards endeavouring to help clear it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first outstanding matter to which I refer is contained in a letter dated 1st June which the Minister kindly wrote to me, and which refers to the consultations which took place with the professions. He
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1120">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>305</span>
understands that the professions have no objections of principle to raise to these clauses. I think that is right and good, and we understand it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It has been queried, however, whether the intended distinction between thewords absolutely discharged' and 'absolute order of discharge' in sub-sections (2)(a) and (4)(a) of NC 4 is made sufficiently plain."</p></blockquote>
That may sound horribly technical to some people, but I hope that nobody will grudge the time it takes to get such wording right. We must avoid leaving arguments which can only be decided by litigation. I know that the professions are concerned to get such wording as makes the meaning clear and thusreduces the dangers of litigation to find out what the statute means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister continues in his letter:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are considering the position with Parliamentary Counsel and, to remove any doubt, will put down an appropriate amendment at Report Stage."</p></blockquote>
I do not quarrel with the proposition that the amendment, which we hope will be the final form of the wording, should come on Report because we shall then have a better chance of getting it right. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will say a word or two on this subject today, however, so that we may have on record how he now sees the position. I also hope that he can let us have whatever amendment it is proposed to offer as early as possible before Report, so that we can have a look at it. Thus, as I have said, we will be able to combine all our efforts to get it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the memorandum submitted last week to the Minister by the Joint Working Party of the Bar and Law Society. For the Minister's convenience, I shall turn straight to page 3. Does thc Minister have a copy of that memorandum? If not I can provide him with one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Clinton Davis)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have the latest memorandum, if that is the one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I turn to page 3 of that memorandum, headed "New Clause4and Clause 6", where the working party says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are most gratified that the principle of an automatic discharge has been accepted as we think it will prove of great value."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>306</span>
It then goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are certain points to which further attention should be given but weappreciate that the new provisions have been drafted under some pressure and we assume that they are still under consideration."</p></blockquote>
That is a reasonable approach. I ask the Minister to give us some indication of what points are receiving further attention and what conclusions have been reached as a result of the further attention which has so far been given to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The working party goes on to deal with one specific point, which I can do no better than read, because it has put it as succinctly and clearly as could reasonably be done. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We should however like to point out one difficulty which arises out of thecombined effect of New Clause 4 and Clause 6(1)(a), which, as at present drafted, create a particular, disadvantaged class of bankrupt, viz, those who have applied for discharge under section 26 of the 1914 Act but have been refused or have withdrawn their application. As regards these bankrupts only, neither the automatic review, nor the automatic discharge procedures will then operate and a further section 26 application will be needed if they are to be discharged. The number of these people will not be great but it seems unfortunate that they should be at a disadvantage to bankrupts who have not applied for discharge under section 26 (and thus not be refused)."</p></blockquote>
The working party then goes on to make a suggestion as to how that difficulty should be overcome. I need only say that we on this side of the Committee think that there is considerable substance in what the working party has said and would welcome an indication of the Minister's views. I am not suggesting that an amendment should be proposed today, or in a hurry, to deal with the matter. I am suggesting that there seems to be substance in what issaid there. It is wholly desirable, if there is a way to overcome the difficulty, that we should overcome it. If the Minister could give us an indication of his thinking on the subject, and later let us have a copy of his proposed amendment. if he proposes to make one, as long before Report as possible, we should be happy to combine in trying to get it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me straight to my main topic. I want to set out briefly what I consider the effects would be of Clause 6, if the amendment were carried, together with New Clause 4, if that, too, were added to the Bill. n addition to the special class of bankrupts to whom I have just referrcd. the change would create four categorics of persons involved in bankruptcy for whom thelaw would be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1121">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>307</span>
different. I deal first with what I believe would be the effect of the Billupon bankruptcies starting after the Bill became law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an order were made under New Clause 4 for an automatic discharge, there would be an automatic discharge after five years unless the bankrupt had made a successful application under Section 26 of the Act within the five years. If the bankrupt made an application under Section 26 but it was not successful, and the discharge had been refused, suspended, or granted on conditions, notwithstanding the fact that the suspension might have resulted in the discharge being postponed beyond the five years, the bankrupt would be automatically discharged under the provisions of New Clause 4. The court could do nothing to prevent the order having that effect, even though, on an up-to-date assessment of the position, the court thought that the dischargeshould be suspended or granted on conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I rely for my view to some extent on what the Minister said at c. 271 on 13th May. If that is a correct assessment of the situation, I wonder whether we are right to tackle the problem this way. We all want to see an automatic discharge, and one which has meaning. Therefore, we do not want the discharge to be hedged about with a lot of ifs and buts. If the effect of what we are doing is that, once an order has been made under New Clause 4, the automatic discharge could not be stopped, ought not we perhaps to think againabout the matter? That I understand to be the position in the case of a bankruptcy arising after the passing of the Bill, where an order is made underNew Clause 4. The position of such a bankruptcy where an order is not made under New Clause 4 remains to be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that case, I understand that bankruptcy would be subject to the terms ofNew Clause 6, namely, that there would be an automatic review in the sixth year following the bankruptcy. I use the word " bankruptcy " compendiously,rather than talking about particular stages of bankruptcy and becoming too technical. That is how I see the law as it would apply to bankruptcies arising after the Bill is enacted. I add this one gloss on that. If I am right,it emphasises the enormous importance of the criteria to be adopted by the court in deciding whether to make
	<span class='label label-info column'>308</span>
an order for automatic discharge under New Clause 4. It will depend, largely from that, which of those two categories embraces the greater number of those who become bankrupt after this Bill becomes law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second category of persons are those who have already been made bankrupt but were made bankrupt less than five years ago. As I understand it, it would still be open to them to apply under Section 26 for discharge. If theydid not apply for a discharge, or if they applied for a discharge and were refused discharge, again as I understand it, there would be an automatic review in the sixth year under the terms of Clause 6. What I am not clear about is where there was an application under Section 26 in which, instead of making an absolute order of discharge, the court made a conditional or suspended order. Would it follow that there would be a review under Clause 6 inthe sixth year, or would the fact that an order had been made on the previous Section 26 application supersede those provisions? Whatever be the position on that last question, it is clear that those who have been made bankrupt in a period of up to five years preceding the passing into law of this Bill will, to the extent that I have indicated, be in a different position from those who are made bankrupt after it.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third category are those who are in a still different position, namely,those who have been made bankrupt more than five years ago but not as long as 10 years ago—that is, before the Act comes into force. As I understand it they could apply for discharge under Section 26 during that five years but that, unless they do that, nothing happens to them until the 10 years is up. On the expiry of the 10 years, there has been an automatic discharge which, clearly, has been made quite regardless of the amounts involved, or of any conduct that might have been involved, or any other factors that were relevant to that particular bankruptcy. Otherwise there is automaticdischarge, whatever the amounts involved, however bad the facts were, and so on. That is the third category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth category comprises of those whose bankruptcies commenced over 10years ago who will, on the passing of the Bill, be automatically discharged.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1122">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>309</span>
Again, I am not quarrelling with the effects of this, but I think it must he made clear. Again, they have been discharged automatically and immediately regardless of the amounts involved, or of any particular facts relating to that bankruptcy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this category, I have another query to raise. I am not myself clear, andit may simply be because I do not know enough about this subject what happens if in the period between the five and the 10 years, namely, preceding the date at which the discharge becomes automatic, on the expiry of 10 years,a bankrupt makes an application under Section 26 and his application is notgranted absolutely, nor is it refused, but a suspended or conditional orderis made. Does that survive? Let us suppose that it was a conditional order that he is discharged on conditions that he pays so much a year for five years, and that order was made in the seventh year. Would that mean that he was not automatically discharged at the end of the tenth year but remained bankrupt for another two years, until he had completed the conditions upon which he was discharged? Again, whatever the answer to that last question may be, the one thing that is clear is that this fourth category I have referred to is different from the other three.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to follow carefully the rather complex points being made by my hon. and learned Friend. On the last point, I think it would he convenient to the Committee if the Minister could indicate at this point whether the answer to the last question is " Yes " or " No ", rather than recapitulate the point when coming to it. I do not know whether he would feel that would he appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to hear the points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) isquite right. This is complex. I do not pretend for a moment that I find it easy. That is why I have tried to set out what I think to be the four different categories and those questions in relation to each. Let me say at oncethat I should not be critical if the Minister were to say on certain questions that he would
	<span class='label label-info column'>310</span>
like to consider the matter and give me an answer later, because I would not expect anybody—except possibly those expert in these matters—to be able to give the answers off the cuff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have now identified five categories of persons who I suggestwould be treated differently in the ways that I have indicated, and in respect of whom there may be further differences and difficulties, depending onthe answers to the questions I have posed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That part of my speech consists of two things which I have tried to combine. One is to outline what I think to be the effect of what is proposed in the creation of these different categories. The second is to combine with that some questions about certain specific matters arising in respect of some of those classes. I think that those are the only five categories in respect of whom there would be very substantial differences in law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to consider the question of the discharge on a debtor consenting to judgment, or on the making of a Dallmeyer order. But, if I have understood correctly, those cases are not affected by those provisions because they involve an absolute discharge anyway. I think it is only in the area ofconditional or suspended discharges that one gets the difficulties to whichI have referred. If I am wrong, I have no doubt that I shall be speedily corrected, and only mention those two because, if my understanding of them is incorrect, there are further considerations to which we should apply our minds. So perhaps the Minister will be so good as to deal with those, either later this morning or at some other stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an attempted analysis of the effect of what we would be doing if wepassed Amendment No. 52 and the new clause. I have offered it for two reasons: first, so that the Minister and his experts can say whether it is right, and if it is not right, so that he can say in what respect it is wrong; secondly, so that we may ask ourselves an all-important question. If we aredoing what I have endeavoured to set out, we have to ask ourselves whether it is right. Is it good to change the law in such a way that it is, in verymaterial respects, different for five different groups of people? Is that anacceptable pattern? If the method that we have chosen leads to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1123">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>311</span>
that degree of differences between different categories of people, should not we reconsider the alternative?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am talking about the law being different in respect of different categories of people. That difference is one that arises purely out of timing. n the different categories that I have identified, the initial difference is only one of timing—the time at which they became bankrupt. The law would be different for the five different categories depending upon the time at which they became bankrupt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, if that is a correct analysis of the situation, should not we consider whether in fact it is an acceptable pattern? Should not we consider the alternatives? I know that the Minister dealt in some detail with the Blagden recommendations, and I am obliged to him for that. But I do not thinkthat he dealt with the Justice recommendations, which are much more recent than the Blagden recommendations, and were put forward by a committee composed entirely of very experienced practitioners and had a fundamental difference. There were fundamental differences in these proposals from those set out by Blagden. I hope that the Minister will say something about those proposals and why it is that he and his advisers have thought it right to reject that basic approach. I say " basic approach " because, in those last observations, I have been dealing with a basic approach. What we have to decide is whether we should have thc basic approach of new Clause 4 as it deals with automatic discharge, and Amendment No. 52 is merely consequential to Clause 6. Should we have the approach of new Clause 4, or should we have thebasic approach of Blagden or the basic approach of Justice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should bc glad to hear from the Minister on the Justice proposals and why he and his advisers thought it right to reject them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Assuming that he persuaded us that new Clause 4 was the right basic approach—I think he may well be able to satisfy most people's doubts or difficulties—I am sure that he would agree that the question we must all ask ourselves is how can we improve it. Can we improve it and, if so. how? If the analysis which I have put before the Committee is anything like right, I sug-
	<span class='label label-info column'>312</span>
gest that we should try to do more before this Bill becomes law to produce a more even result and to make quite clear that the questions that I have asked and the many others which may arise are dealt with in advance and thatthe wording of the statute is such that we shall not have a lot of litigation on those sort of queries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another question that we can now ask ourselves and that, if the Minister agrees with my analysis, he and his experts can and should ask themselves, iswhat we think the consequences will be. Do we think that what we are doing will result in a substantial number of orders for automatic discharges, or do we think that the number of orders made under new Clause 4 will probablybe quite small?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next question—how much work do we think will be created by Clause 6—depends on the answer to the first question because, in all cases of future bankruptcies, those in respect of which an order is not made under new Clause 4 will fall to be dealt with by the Service under Clause 6. I do not think there can be any question about this. Every case which the Service has to deal under Clause 6 will entail careful and time-consuming effort. It must 	<i>do</i> as the Service has to produce a report in cases on which the court is to bc invited to review the position. That will impose asubstantial burden upon the Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to the first of those last questions that I postulated—how many cases do we think will he dealt with under new Clause 4—must depend upon the nature of the criteria which we include in new Clause 4 when we add it to this Bill. I am not, of course, asking for a precise figure.Some sort of proportion may be the best that can be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments (a), (b). (c) and (d) to new Clause 4, which are grouped with this amendment, were briefly referred to by the Minister at the last Sitting.He said, that in the timing of events he had not had time to look closely at the amendments and therefore would like to have another look at them. In the comments I made on that occasion, I welcomed that statement and broadlyindicated what lay behind, the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1124">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>313</span>
Amendments (a) and (b) relate solely to the criteria. Nobody is suggesting—certainly not my hon. Friend or I—that the wording of Amendments (a) or (b), though alternatives, would provide the answer. We are concerned about this matter, and now that the Minister has had time to consider it, I hope that he will turn his attention to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In new Clause 4, as it stands, the facts referred to in Section 26(3) of the Bankruptcy Act 1926 are to be referred to by the court "in particular". Whilst feeling that that might set such a high test for the court, the courtmight find itself saying in every case that because one of the facts referred to in Section 26(3) was present, it should not make an order for automatic discharge or it might be reluctant to make such an order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not cite the facts set out in Section 26(3) to the Committee, but Idraw the Committee's attention to the fact that they are numerous and detailed. One can see that if the court had to pay regard "in particular" to those facts, it could be restrictive, with the result that the number of automatic discharges under our new clause would be small. We would have taken a big step forward with little effect. None of us want to do that. We want totake this big step forward in the hope, expectation and belief that it willmake a difference, both in advantage to debtors and creditors in knowing where they stand and in taking some work off the service. If we then make thecondition so restrictive that few orders are made, we defeat our objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I would appreciate it if the Minister could tell us a little more, now that he has had time to think about it, about what the present criteria mean, how they would work and what effect they would have. At the last Sitting, I told him that there were three areas that concerned us. That wasone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second was the area of conditional discharges. I shall say no more about that matter, since I have again referred to it in some of the questions Iasked in my analysis of the effect of these provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to put one last matter to the Minister. We must have some estimate of the consequence of what we do, both in relation to debtor and creditor, but more particularly in relation to the service. It is said that what is crucial in this
	<span class='label label-info column'>314</span>
Bill is reducing some of the weight on the service and thus reducing publicexpenditure. That may be right. It must be balanced against keeping up the service to the customer. I am sure that hon. Members agree on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that it is a proper consideration. We cannot tell whether we are doing the right thing unless we have some estimates. We did not press for estimates at the outset because we anticipated that changes would occur as we progressed with the Bill. Changes have already been made. There has been a lot of thought about the Bill that did not happen before. May we now have some sort of estimates of the extra burden which it is now thought that new Clause 4 and new Clause 6 together will impose upon the service? There is no getting away from the fact that the changes must impose a new burden, because new Clause 6 imposes a new responsibility. Is it said that that extra burden is to be offset by the savings to be made by reason of the changes in Clause 1? Or is it said that the savings to be made through the changes under Clause 1 will more than offset increased burdens arising from new Clause 6? Where does Clause 8 come into the matter? That will impose extra expense—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are discussing a wide variety of amendments but we have not yet reached Clause 8.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that we had reached Clause 8. I merely observedthat I wondered what would be the effect of the savings on that clause. I suggest that it would he fatuous to take one extra expense in isolation. We are talking about an increased burden, which must be considered in relationto the other additional burdens and the other savings. I believe that discussion of that subject would help the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am asking for specifically in respect of this debate is an estimate of what effect it is thought the change will have. Which costs of the extraburdens imposed on both manpower and money will relate to which clauses? Weshould appreciate any assistance that the Minister can give the Committeeonthose questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has presented his com-

	<span class='label label-info column'>315</span>
ments cogently and helpfully. I shall do my best to respond in a similar vein.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the outset, the hon. and learned Gentleman asked me whether, in anticipation of any amendments that I might wish to produce on Report, I would consult him and his hon. Friends. I in no way resile from the position that I have occupied throughout the passage of the Bill, not simply in relation to the proceedings in the Committee but outside, too; but I readily respond tothe hon. and learned Gentleman's invitation, notwithstanding the extraneousevents which might to some extent have thwarted those laudable ambitions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the measure of cooperation which has gone on throughout recent weeks will continue. I shall certainly consult the hon. and learned Gentleman about these matters, because he is right; we are dealing with a highly technical area of the law. None of us is an expert on these difficult technical matters. Not only is it right that we should consult between ourselves, but we should have regard to the views being expressed by my officials,who are expert in the administration of the bankruptcy law, and people outside the Department. I am sure that the Committee agrees that we owe a debt of gratitude to them all for the arduous work which they have undertaken so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman pointed out that there are anomalies in our proposals. In just the same way, I was able to point out anomalies in the Blagden Committee's proposals and in the amendments put forward by the Opposition. I fear that there will continue to be anomalies, whatever solutions we try to work out, however we try to maximise the advantages to be procured from further amendment of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The expression "anomalies" is something of a euphemism, I suggest. What we are actually talking about is the word "discriminatory", whichis different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will allow me to make a general point here, and I shall then attempt to pursue in more detail the points that were made by his hon. and learned Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that we shall be able to cure every problem as a result of our
	<span class='label label-info column'>316</span>
deliberations, nor do I think that those professional advisers who have participated to a marked degree in those deliberations believe that either. Often the best is the enemy of the good, and I think that we should set our sights on achieving what is reasonably possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been assailed in the past, although not too mightily, for saying that a major review of insolvency law is taking place which I hope will correct some of the anomalies that the operation of this enactment may throw up. We are all learning as a result of this and we shall have to see how the situation evolves. Because there is, contemporaneously with this position, a major review of insolvency law, we shall in due course have the benefit of the considerations of that review to help us, and we shall have the advantage of the Bill in the next year or so, however it may be amended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first matter referred to by the hon. and learned Gentleman was the concern that had been mentioned by the Law Society in its memorandum to me dated June 1976. I believe that the hon. and learned Gentleman quoted from it, and it would be helpful if at some stage he could produce a copy of it. Perhaps I can do it; it does not really matter. However, because the document has been quoted from, I think that it is appropriate for it to be laid before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will gladly do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It sets out the,differences which remain between ourselves and the Law Society. It is right anyway, in accordance with the rules, that once one quotes from a document, one is required to lay it before the Committee. I see that the hon. Gentleman is laying something before the Committee now. Is he laying the memorandum and not the accompanying document, which was not quoted from?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would be best to consider the position, because my impression was that the laying of documents applied only to the Government, although I may be mistaken. No doubt the matter can be considered andwe can decide how best to deal with this purely technical or mechanical problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is easily curable because I am happy to do it myself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. We act more expeditiously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding the first point raised by the hon. and learned Gentleman, on the phrase "absolutely discharged", the advice that I have received from parliamentary counsel is that this difficulty can be resolved by deleting the word absolutely" in subsections (2)(a) and 4(a) of new Clause 4, and adding, after the words "the date of the adjudication in" subsection (2)(a) and after the words "the relevant date" in subsection (4)(a) wording along the following lines—the lion. and learned Gentleman has not invited me to table an amendment now and I do not wish to do so, but I should like to give an indication of what parliamentary counsel has in mind—namely, the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"…whether by absolute order of discharge or a suspended or conditional order which has come into operation or the conditions of which have been complied with."</p></blockquote>
I do not expect the hon. and learned Gentleman to absorb that any more readily than I was able to absorb all the points he was making, but I shall be discussing this with him, and I hope that the problem will be overcome, because an amendment will be tabled on Report to deal with the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman went on to refer to what he declared was an anomaly in the operation of new Clause 4 and Clause 6, and in fact that is the second point made in the memorandum that has been submitted. I do not deny that there is something in that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is alleged that there will be created a particular disadvantaged class of bankrupt in consequence of the operation of these two provisions. There will be those who have applied for discharge under Section 26 of the 1914 Act but have been refused or have withdrawn their application, because neither the automatic discharge nor automatic review procedures will operate. If the adjudication order was made more than five years before the coming intoeffect of the clause, all such bankrupts will be automatically discharged on the tenth anniversary under new Clause 4. That point was made by
	<span class='label label-info column'>318</span>
the hon. and learned Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But for all bankrupts whose adjudication took place within the five years preceding the coming into effect of the clause, and for all new bankrupts adjudged after the coming into force of the clause, the review procedure willnot operate if the bankrupt has applied for an order of discharge under Section 26 of the 1914 Act. If he has withdrawn the application—this point was not covered in the hon. and learned Gentleman's speech—he will be deemed not to have applied. I think that it is right that that point should be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for this provision was that if the court had already reviewed the bankruptcy on the bankrupt's application, it was felt that there was no need for the court automatically to review it again. Whilst there are equally good grounds for saying that the review procedure should apply to cases where the discharge has been applied for and refused, and since otherwise the bankrupt will remain undischarged unless he applies to the court either for a review of the order or by way of a new application for discharge, certain practical difficulties would arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, if the bankruptcy was automatically reviewed, say five years after the order refusing the discharge, and then the court again refused it, it could be argued that another automatic review should be carried out five years later, and so on, so there is a real practical difficulty there. Secondly, since it is possible under the review procedure where no previous application has been made for the court to refuse the discharge, these cases wouldalso need to be automatically reviewed every five years until a discharge was eventually granted. It should be stressed that the purpose of the reviewprocedure is to endeavour to ensure that every bankruptcy is reviewed by the court either on the bankrupt's application or automatically after five years. Once the court has carried out such a review, and in this way endeavoured to sort out the sheep from the goats—we hope that the sheep willbe in the majority, and I will deal with that point later—it is not unreasonable to impose an obligation upon those people whose applications have been refused to move the court themselves if they wish to be discharged. This class of bankrupt is disadvantaged and is the author of his own misfortune. In the last sitting I made the point that under new Clause 3 we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1127">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>319</span>
would be peretuating a problem for undischarged bankrupts by retaining thispool or even stimulating a new pool of undischarged bankrupts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the position is different. Under new Clause 3, the court will not have made a determination, whereas under the procedure that I have outlinedthe court will positively refuse an order. I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman to consider that point, which is one of substance, before we pursue the Report stage. I hope that he will find it persuasive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman then mentioned the different categories thatwould be created. I do not quarrel with his analysis, and I think that he has made a point. Later, I will refer again to the alternatives that are postulated. I suggest to the Committee that the way in which we tackle this problem, albeit that we create this form of categorisation, represents the best way in all the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One point made by the hon. and learned Gentleman was that there was some anxiety—which I share to some degree—that the court should be able to withhold automatic discharge. I do not think that he was arguing thepoint. He was simply putting it forward as a problem that we all should recognise rather than saying that he wished to effect a different solution from the one which I put forward in my earlier speech. I think it right that Ishould take him up on that point. He was saying, in effect, that we should consider whether the court should be provided with some means whereby it might withhold automatic discharge on the grounds that one might have a particularly difficult case and could not let off a rogue without creating a measure of unfairness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be possible to provide that an application for a review could be made by the trustees of the court in exceptional circumstances. This would impose a heavy burden on the Official Receiver, and there is no doubt that he would probably be exposed to a great deal of pressure and prompting by creditors in most cases. One would also have to try and define what the exceptional circumstances were. I think that we would find ourselves locked intoa very difficult position which could possibly lead to the thwarting of what both sides of the Committee seek to attain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>320</span>
The hon. and learned Gentleman referred to the criteria—a point thathe had made in the last sitting—and I do not think there is a great deal between us. But the criteria which we seek to establish and which we think the court should follow under Section 26 of the 1914 Act represent thesort of guidelines that should be available to the court. I think that everything that is more vague will create more difficulties. I do not need to rehearse the argument because I referred to it at some length at our sittingon 13th May.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next point to which the hon. and learned Gentleman specifically referred was what the effect would be if the court made a conditional or suspendedorder. I think I have already answered the hon. and learned Gentleman on this point, but, to summarise the position, Clause 6 would not apply because the bankrupt had already applied for his discharge, and the court would therefore either have looked at the case or will look at it and a further review would not be necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are only three areas in which this question of conditional order arise. One is the one that the hon. Gentleman has just mentioned,on which I agree that he is right, and that the position is clear. The other is where an application is made under Section 26, where there has been anorder for automatic discharge, and on that application under Section 26 a conditional order is made. As I understand it, the position in that case is clear. It does not survive the five-year period, and the five-year period for discharge is automatic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third area arises where there is an application under Section 26 between the five- and 10-year periods and a conditional order is then made. As I understand it, if that conditional order extends over the 10-year period, in that case it survives beyond the 10-year period and postpones the automatic discharge. That is the third area in which it arises. I mention that because he has dealt with two and might find it convenient to deal with the third one in the same part of his speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. and learned Gentleman is right about that. I want to think a little more about it. He invited me to do so. I am not absolutely positive of the answer, and I think it is wrong for me to offer an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1128">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>321</span>
answer which just comes off the top of my head and may be wrong, so I will seek some advice on that. I will either deal with it later on or on anotheroccasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman me why I had rejected the propositions of Justice which in a sense are embodied, because I am seeking to do what the hon. and learned Gentleman has put down in his amendment. We have taken a good deal of the Opposition's thinking into our proposals, but where we have stopped is at the question of the caveat. I thought that I had dealt fairly extensively with that at the sitting on 13 May. I took the point then that I thought the caveat procedure would impose heavier loads upon both the Official Receiver's department and the court, namely the questions of the transcript, the longer time that the proceedings would take at that particular stage, and so on. Rather than rehearse the arguments again, I refer to my comments in cc 268 and 269 where those matters were dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman asked me to provide him with an analysis of the work that would be entailed by reason of the operation of new Clause 4 and Clause 6. It is a very difficult question to answer, because we are to some extent dealing with a situation which we cannot wholly foresee. However, I am grateful to him for saying that he did not expect me to provide himwith a detailed list of statistics or forecasts of that kind, and would be happy to receive some information in terms of percentages. This I am prepared to do.

Bankruptcies basically, I am advised, fall into three categories. There arestraightforward ones, which are probably in the area of 25 per cent. to 30 per cent. Then we have the area of middling difficulty. This is a little difficult to define but it represents about 60 per cent. Then we have about 10 per cent. which provide a substantial degree of culpability, and these are the difficult matters.

The court will almost certainly order automatic discharge in what were originally presented to me as the "white" cases. But I decided not to refer to them by colour because I could get into all sorts of problems by doing
	<span class='label label-info column'>322</span>
that. So we will call these the straightforward cases. Almost equally certainly, the 10 per cent. of the worst type of case—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether I might press the Minister a little on that matter. He says that the court will almost certainly order automatic discharge in this simplest group of cases. I am not quite clear what his basis is for saying that. I should have thought that this was a matter decided by the court, and there may be a number of points which I may raise in the "Clause stand part" debate, which would lead the court to believe that they should not proceed in this manner. Has the Minister any basis at all for the remark he has just made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, because we anticipate that these straightforward cases, with very little degree of culpability—I should not use the word "misfortune" because that has a particular definition in terms of bankruptcy law—but cases where somebody has fallen on bad times, do not represent essentially difficult issues either for the Official Receiver or forthe court. I do not think I could possibly define in detail the cases that fall into that category, because they vary so. There is, quite clearly, as I think the experts will recognise, this category of case which ought to present very little difficulty. I am not saying that the court must so decide—I am not saying that at all. It is a matter about which the court will be able to exercise discretion, and it will be operating the guidelineswhich we have already discussed. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not make too much of this, because I can only generalise about this situation. I cannot be absolutely specific.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the worst type of case, where there is a substantial degree of culpability, almost certainly these are cases which will be dealt with by the review procedure. But to what extent this middling area of case—the 60per cent.—will be granted automatic discharge, is problematical. It is because it is dangerous to speculate that I am reluctant to take up the challenge of the hon. and learned Gentleman. I can only do my best to offeradvice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Assuming that the court were to make an order in about half these cases, the result would be that we would have an automatic discharge in about 60 percent.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1129">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>323</span>
of all bankruptcies, and we would have a review procedure operating in about 40 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an average year, there are about 4,000 bankruptcies. So that would mean that we would have about 1,600 of them falling to be reviewed. We have 60 courts all over the country which deal with these matters, and we have 34 Official Receivers. Therefore, the Committee will have an opportunity of assessing the burden that will fall. But the courts do not have an equality of work in these matters, and it is difficult to postulate with any degree of accuracy how this will fall to be dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the bankruptcy work load falls to the extent that we expect from the increase in the monetary limits, the figures that I have just referred to, which are "pre" the increase in the monetary limits, would probably be about halved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The procedure for review is intended to operate in the following way. First, when thc transcript of the notes of the public examination are received, the Official Receiver will prepare his review report so far as is possible.Next, the bankruptcy will be automatically brought forward for review on the fifth anniversary of the order of adjudication. The next step is that theOfficial Receiver will update his review report with such information as has been brought to his attention during the period since the public examination. He will file that report with his application for the review in the court. Next, notice of hearing will be sent to the bankruptcy and it will be published in the 	<i>London Gazette.</i> Normally the registrar will conductthe review hearing in chambers, although creditors will be able to appear and of course may be heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the first five years. following the operation of Clause 6, all bankrup cies will fall to be reviewed unless an application for discharge has already been made under Section 26, and it is estimated that about 3,000 will have to be reviewed in the first year, rising to about 5,000 in the fifth year. I know that this is not a wholly satisfactory analysis of the situation,but I indicated at the beginning that it is virtually impossible to provideother than a somewhat generalised statement of the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have dealt with virtually all the points that were made by the hon. and learned Gentleman, either directly
	<span class='label label-info column'>324</span>
this morning, or in the statement that I made on 13 May. I can only end where I began, by saying that there is no easy solution to the problems that we have in dealing with the question of automatic discharge. What we have done is to make a radical change. I was almost tempted to use the word "revolutionary", but as I have assailed the hon. and learned Gentleman for that on previous occasions, I should not. I think, on balance, it has been the right thing to do. It has been welcomed in principle by the professional bodies, and I think that it will solve a very real problem in terms of this pool of undischarged bankrupts, where many people are, no doubt, committing criminal offences, perhaps unknowingly in many instances. This situation should not be perpetuated. I hope, therefore, that the Committee will feel it appropriate to approve the steps which I have outlined on behalf of the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to the Minister. That is a helpful commentary on the points that I raised. The Minister need have no fear that his observations will not be carefully considered by us, and I have no doubt by the working party as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are four points on which I want to comment briefly. The Minister referred to the review. I quite agree that that is of enormous importance, but the only way in which we can test its importance is by knowing how it is getting on, if it has actually started and what the plan is for consultation,and so on. This is not the time to go into that, but it would be helpful ifthe Minister or his officials could let us have a memorandum on it. It is relevant to this but it is also relevant in a much wider context. It would be useful for us to know how far the review has got and how its progress is planned, particularly with consultation in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding the amendment which the hon. Gentleman proposes to table on Report to delete the word "absolutely", what I would suggest is …
As for the amendment he proposes to table on Report to delete the word "absolutely", I suggest, if it is not considered revolutionary, that when the parliamentary counsel has a draft which satisfies the Department, we might have a sight of it before it is finalised. I always
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1130">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>325</span>
think that it is better to reach agreement on a matter before somebody finalises it. To summarise, if the Minister can send us a draft at the earliestpossible moment, he may rest assured that our sole desire will be to agree with it or to improve on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the matter raised by the working party in its memorandum which I quoted,the Minister made a valid point that if one tries to deal with the class ofbankrupt there referred to, how does one bring in Clause 6 on automatic review? It would be wasteful to have, first, an application under Section 26 which was turned down after careful consideration and, two years later, to have an automatic review and the work that that entails, under Clause 6. I accept the validity of his point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was suggested by the working party, the Minister will recollect, that itshould be dealt with by providing that in such a case the automatic review under Clause 6 should be deferred for five years after the determination ofthe Section 26 application. I invite him to consider that suggestion which seems to be a workmanlike and practical possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one other matter to which I want to refer. I am glad that the Minister has been able to give us an estimate of how our proposal will work outin terms of workload, how many bankruptcies are likely to be the subject ofan order for automatic discharge, and how many under the review procedure and so on, Again, I assure the Minister that that matter will receive careful consideration. One thing sticks out a mile, however. Until we started on this New Clause 4 exercise, the bankruptcies to which he referred would have been the subject of an automatic review under Clause 6 which must be an expensive procedure in terms of manpower and money because it can only be done thoroughly. It would be useless and unfair to everybody unless it was done thoroughly. I do not believe that the Service would quote such a provision on any basis other than that it must painstakingly and carefully carry out its duties under Clause 6. So that must be expensive. If I rightly understood the figures that the Minister gave, we would save that expense in 60 per cent. of the cases in which it would otherwise have arisen, because it will not arise in cases where there is an order for automatic discharge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>326</span>
The Minister said he anticipated—and I would not dream of holding him to this figure 10 per cent. either way—that about 60 per cent. would be the subject of an automatic discharge. Let us say that those expectations are disappointed and that the figure is only 50 per cent. It would still halve the number of reviews to be carried out under Clause 6. I am not such a poor mathematician or so inexperienced in these matters as to say that one can straight away halve the time and expense involved. One cannot, because the 50 per cent. or 60 per cent. of cases are the subject of automatic discharge and, 	<i>ex hypothesi,</i> would be simpler ones and therefore would have been least expensive in terms of manpower and money under Clause 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If those figures are anywhere near right, however, there must be a substantial and commendable saving of manpower and money against what would have been the position had Clause 6 applied to all bankruptcies. To my mind, that opens up a consideration about which we should think carefully. Since what we are doing by New Clause 4 and Clause 6 not only improves the law but saves money, does that not mean that when we again look at other areas, particularly those under Clause I where it is desired to save money, we have a little in hand which may enable us to reconsider the position further?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Though I must not trespass upon the indulgence of the Chair by talking about Clause 1, we all recognise that we are talking about a fact and that to try to deal with anything in isolation would be unrealistic. Therefore, I ask the Minister to have a look at that matter. I also ask him to consider this. What he has now done with these figures is helpful. Nobody expects him to give figures off the top of his head—to use his phrase. We would not want them, we would not ask for them, and we would not think that they were of great value. I mean no disrespect to the Minister, but nobody can give figures off the top of his head. We expect them to be assessed by his officials who are expert in these matters. We recognise their difficulties in making such estimates, but, since the Bill is beginning to take shape, they both can and should wish to be as specific about the effects as they can. Now that we have a sample of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1131">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>327</span>
these figures let us, if it is possible, build on them as the picture becomes clearer by having more assessments from his officials as to the effect in terms of manpower and money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those observations, I welcome the assistance which the Minister has given. I also welcome his assurance of further assistance to come between nowand Report stage and feel that in this area we are getting close to doing something which will be of value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might add a postscript to what my hon. and learned Friend has said. These are clearly matters of great complexity and, indeed, the Minister has indicated that he wishes to consider some of the points which we have raised rather than give an immediate reply. While I would not recommend to my hon. Friends that we should oppose the Government's amendments and substitute either our amendments or some later variation on them or on the Blagden or Justice proposals, I make it clear that we will also wishto look carefully at the various arguments that have been put forward, whenthey are available in print. and consider whether the answer we now come upwith is, in broad terms, the right one as well as whether it is right as regards the detailed points. Subject only to those remarks. I do not wish to oppose the Government's amendments. It may be best to add them to the Bill and to look at the package, which my hon. and learned Friend has described,before we come to Report stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I merely wanted to stress clearly that that is without commitment to the view which we will eventually take. They are matters which will require outside consultation and which will require careful study. It is a further change in the Bill which I hope will go towards improving it and, on that basis,that we can make further progress. I add, however, that I shall have one ortwo points to raise on "Clause stand part" if the proposed amendments are carried.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 53. in page 4, line 42. leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"apply to the court for a review"</p></blockquote>
and insert
	<span class='label label-info column'>328</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"make an application to the court in respect".</p></blockquote>
This is a short matter. The amendment has the effect of changing the description of the procedure under which bankruptcies will fall to be reviewed for the purpose of discharge. This follows representations made to us by someprofessional bodies that the description of the review procedure used in the Bill, namely,
	<br><blockquote><p>"a review of the adjudication"</p></blockquote>
was not appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although my officials and parliamentary draftsmen did not think that the original wording was incorrect, I am advised that the other wording proposed could equally be applicable. Therefore, as objections were raised, and we see no positive reason to resist the proposed change, we suggest that the original wording be amended. The amendment will describe the procedure as
	<br><blockquote><p>"an application to the court in respect of the adjudication".</p></blockquote>
I hope that hon. Members see no problem in agreeing to that change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say a word on this topic. I am not entirely clear whether this meets the point which I intended to raise later, or whether it overcomes the difficulty. I think that the appropriate course would be to let the amendment be accepted. but I might wjsh to comment or refer tothe matter on the "Clause stand part" debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed.</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might raise various questions which I have already mentioned that I should like to ask the Minister to consider at this stage in our proceedings. The first is on a broad issue. The Committee has been adjourned, if that is the right expression. for some time, and no doubt the long-term review to which the Minister referred has been continuing. I suggest that it would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman could give an indication of how that review is progressing and when he expects the review body to complete its deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second Question arises from some of the figures given by the Under-Secretary in the debates on amendments which have been carried this morning. The hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1132">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>329</span>
Gentleman said that the limits in the earlier part of the Bill would, he thought, reduce by about half the number of cases coming forward. When the Minister gave us that statistic, which is an interesting one, I was not clearwhether he was referring to the total number of bankruptcies or to the number of automatic discharges, and at what stage in the proceedings the hon. Gentleman thought that that would be the effect of the change in the limits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proceedings which we propose to introduce under the clause will, if I understand the matter correctly—on this Bill one should probably preface all one's remarks with the phrase " If I understand correctly "—have a running-in period in which some of the backlog of existing bankruptcies will be dealt with, and that gradually it will settle into an equilibrium position. When the Minister said that he thought that the changes in the earlier limits would halve the number of cases, did he mean that that would be in the run-in period or whether that would be the effect he envisaged after the situation had settled down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to several other questions. Again, I find myself in some difficulty because we have now made substantial changes to the Bill and, therefore. it is not always easy to ascertain precisely whether the recommendations or criticisms made at earlier stages still apply. n the mass of re-drafting which has taken place, many of those matters may have been dealt with. Although the matters arise from representations we received as long ago as last February. I believe that they are still valid in respect of Clause 6. Perhaps the Minister will be kind enough to comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first issue refers to the actual question of the review of adjudication of bankruptcy after five years. The title on the left-hand margin of the clause is not. I understand. part of the Bill. Nevertheless. Clause 6 begins:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This section applies to any adjudication of bankruptcy made after, or within five years before, the coming into force of this section".</p></blockquote>
It is not clear whether the expression in the title of the clause, namely.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Review of adjudication of bankruptcy after five years",</p></blockquote>
is appropriate. The clause appears to he concerned with the question of discharge,
	<span class='label label-info column'>330</span>
which does not actually have anything to do with the matter of reviewing the adjudication in bankruptcy. As I understand it, once the bankruptcy has been adjudicated, that is something which has happened throughout the entireproceedings. That point cannot suddenly be reviewed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that that heading was what we were seeking to deal with under Amendment No. 53, which we have just passed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: if that is so, that is fine. I was not absolutely clear whether that was the case, which is why I did not deal with the topic at that time but left my comments for the "Clause stand part" debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make sure that we have got the matter right. Amendment No.53 makes an alteration in line 42, page 4, but the left-hand margin title remains the same. The Minister is reading hurrjedly through his copy of the Bill which I see he has amended as we progress. I am talking about page 4, Clause 6. Although we have amended line 42, which is apparently camouflagedby a later accretion on the Minister's copy, we have left ourselves the side title,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Review of adjudication of bankruptcy after five years."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might help the hon. Gentleman. I think that he has answered his own question. The clause title does not form part of the Bill.It can be altered by various means which we do not need to go into, but that is not necessarily done in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. English, for your help. although confess that I am not unfamiliar with the problem. I have run across it before. Usually all that needs to be done in these circumstances is to ask the Minister for an assurance that such an alteration will be made. If the Minister will give that assurance, that will be satisfactory. However, that stilldoes not resolve the problem, because the opening words of the clause, in line 31, state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This section applies to any adjudication of bankruptcy made after …"</p></blockquote>
If the Minister has expert advice on this point, I shall he happy to hear his comment. I do not want to labour the point.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1133">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>331</span>
It makes the Bill somewhat untidy. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will give an assurance that the matter will be cleared up, so that a clause which, as I understand it, has nothing to do with reviewing the adjudication of bankruptcy will not be so described or contain phrases which suggests that it has.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the question of discrimination. Although we have made progress this morning, and the number of categories of bankrupts have been divided variously, the Minister giving three and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) giving five categories, I suggest that a considerable element of discrimination exists still between the categories. What we need to weigh, between now and Report, is the extent to which that discrimination is justified. We must consider to what extent the discrimination, and it is discrimination and not just the creation of anomalies, should be tidied up further or, if possible, eliminated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has put considerable stress on the actual savings which are likely to take place under the Bill. Under this clause, we still have doubts about the burden which will fall upon the Official Receiver as he will, as I understand it, need to carry out a review, both in the transitional period and when the situation has stabilised. It appears to us that the work involved is likely to be very considerable and may well offset, or even greatly offset, the savings expected as a result of the change of the monetary limits. That particular aspect—the burden which will fall upon the Official Receiver and his staff—is still a matter which gives us some cause for concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also worth picking up the other statistic mentioned by the Minister. He thought that the figure would start at 3,000 or so a year, rising to 5,000 after five years. The estimate originally made by those who are actuallyoperating in the field was a figure of some 7,000. Whether there is simply a straight conflict or whether this reflects some of the changes that we made in the Bill I am not absolutely clear, but perhaps the Minister would care to comment on how precise he thinks the figure of 5,000 to be, or whether 7,000 might, in fact, be equally valid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That having been said, we come to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>332</span>
question of what percentage of the simpler cases are likely to be dealt with automatically and without delay. Here there is a problem, as the Ministersought to express a view, or it could be less emotionally described as an estimate, of the extent to which judges might deal with these matters in theway he describes. The question arises whether this is likely to be so if the bankrupt is not present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that on the present statistics there are certain percentages of simple cases and certain percentages of mediumdiflicult cases, and perhaps 10 per cent. or so, very difficult cases. As I understand it, under the present procedure, the bankrupt individual appears before the court—perhaps the Minister will correct me if I am wrong—whereas under this procedure the bankrupt will not appear before the court. if this is so, is ita reasonable assumption that the judges concerned will actually deal with the matter as spontaneously as the Minister has suggested? I should have thought that there might be a considerable tendency for those concerned with these matters not to deal with the matter too superficially, simply because the kind of simple information which one can obtain from someone who is actually appearing before the court—perhaps by half-a-dozen questions of a very simple kind—will not be possible. The person making the decision will have to do so very much in the dark and, if there is some point about which he is unsure, either he has to decide not to worry about it, which I would think is not his normal tendency, or he will have to say that he will not accept it or that he must go into the matter further. Therefore,there are problems which arise because the suggestion now is that the individual concerned should not actually appear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That particular question raises a number of other difficulties which suggest that generally the tendency may be for a judgment to be given to the effect that the application is not to be treated on a spontaneous basis, but should be investigated rather more clearly. This is particularly so if the court is rightly concerned about whether the whole operation of the individual being made bankrupt has benefited significantly his creditors. What we are proposing here is that there should be a much more easy form of discharge, in some cases, and that necessarily implies that the chances of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1134">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>333</span>
the creditors getting something from the wreckage is diminished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This brings me to the final point, which is whether it will be fairer to the more deserving bankrupts or whether the fact that they get this discharge, is something which, on the whole, they would prefer not to have. It also raises a simple point-1 am not sure of the answer—about whether those people to be discharged wish to be discharged or not. I am not clear if that is so. It appears that people who five years or so before were just bankrupts, who may have moved and wish to forget about the whole proceedings, may have their names, whether they want it or not—published in the 	<i>London Gazette</i> and court proceedings follow. This may well prove quite traumatic for a number of individuals—the more deserving ones—rather than the others. It seems to be less fair on them in some ways than the existing situation. Perhaps the Minister would comment on that simple, but in terms of concern for individuals, not unimportant point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has asked me to comment on the long-term review. Rather than burden the Committee, I will respond to his hon. and learned Friend's invitation to consider-1 do not now give an undertaking—perhaps corresponding with the hon. and learned Gentleman, or perhaps it is a matter which should go wider than that, but to give some thought to a memorandum detailing the scope of the review at an appropriate stage and dealing with the period which it is likely to take. I am advised—and I think I mentioned this earlier—that it will be about two or three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an important and profound job that has to be undertaken. We do not want a skimped effort which will provide us with no better solutions to the many problems which will arise. I will advise the hon. Gentleman very shortly of the course which I propose to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the question of the limits, I was alluding to the effect of these on the review position. That was the specific point to which the hon. Gentleman was referring. The figures I gave were rough ones, and we have to take into account, to some degree, the process of settling down, as he put it. I cannot, therefore, be more specific now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>334</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not clear what it is that is being halved. The hon. Gentleman said that the review procedure was concerned. Is he saying that the load on the courts will be halved because at the moment we do not have the same load? We have the system whereby people apply for discharge, whereas, under this system, it will be automatic. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will spell it out a little, I am not clear what animal is being chopped up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must ask the Committee's forgiveness if I was not being sufficiently clear. I was talking about the load on the Insolvency Service, not of the load on the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of discrimination, we have a Sex Discrimination Act and a Race Discrimination Act, and no doubt, if the hon. Gentleman had his way, we would have a Bankrupt Discrimination Act. I do not know how we are to resolve this problem. We have, for the time being at least, decided to accept the proposals that I put forward—new Clause 4 and Clause 6—to see how they work out. I was quite frank with the Committee, and I agreed that the hon. and learned Gentleman's analysis of the position cataloguing people in this way was—so far as I could see—not inaccurate. But we are trying to achieve what is best, and the Committee has made its determination on that, but the hon. Gentleman may wish to refer to it at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the burden on the Insolvency Service, perhaps I should have dealt with that more fully earlier. May I explain it in this way? The burden on theOfficial Receiver Service which will arise from the operation of new Clause4 and Clause 6 will be the preparation of the report for the review. In many instances, this will avoid the need for the preparation of ordinary discharge reports—which will partly offset the extra work—and the standardisation of the review report will also keep the extra workload to much more manageable proportions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me how precise was the figure of 5,000 that I gavefor the fifth year. I do not stand absolutely by that figure; I do not knowwhether at this stage a figure of 7,000 is an accurate forecast, either. Nobody would would pretend that these forecasts are anything other than very rough. We shall have to see how it all operates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1135">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>335</span>
Regarding the percentage of simpler cases which will be dealt with automatically, the hon. Gentleman perhaps made a slight error when he said that under the new proposals the bankrupt would not attend. That is not accurate; he will of course be given notice and will have the right to attend, and no doubt some will wish to do so. Again, we shall have to see how it works out. But it is wrong to suggest that in such cases the court will be presentedwith tremendous difficulty because of the absence of the bankrupt. The Official Receiver will have submitted his report, and he will only have done that in co-operation with the bankrupt or in cases where there is no reason why a case should not be dealt with in a totally straightforward way. So, inthe majority of cases which fall to be dealt with in this category, there will be no real problem for the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not absolutely sure that the Minister's point was right. He said that the bankrupt will have the right to appear. I have difficulty in reconciling that with subsection (5), which says that except where the court directs otherwise, an application may be heard in the absence of the bankrupt. It may be that this is a highly technical drafting point, but, as I understand those words, unless the court, and not the individual, says so, the application may be heard in the absence of the bankrupt. I am not clear about where that guarantees that, if the bankrupt wants to appear, he may do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What happens is that the bankrupt will be given notice and, if he does not want to attend, he will not do so, but that, if the court thinks that it is appropriate for him to be there so that he may be questioned, the court will have the right to direct otherwise. That is how I understand the position that would arise on the required presence in court of the bankrupt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But where in the drafting does it say that the bankrupt may insist on appearing if he so wishes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it follows by reason of the fact that the bankrupt will have been given notice of his entitlement to appear. That is provided for in subsection (3), which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The court shall appoint a day for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>336</span>
hearing of the application and notice of the appointment shall be published… and sent fourteen days at least before the day so appointed to thebankrupt. (4) On the hearing of the application the court shall take intoconsideration a report of the official receiver … that report shall beprima facie evidence of the statements therein contained."</p></blockquote>
It follows from that that the bankrupt does have right of audience, becauseit is a matter that is dealt with by way of application to the court, and, because he has received notice of the application, he will have a right to be heard. In the majority of cases, of course, the bankrupt will willingly assist in attempting to achieve such a situation; he will not be prejudicedby it.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman then raised the novel point that some people might prefer to remain undischarged bankrupts, and asked if we were being fair to them. How one calculates the number of people who wish to remain under the disability of bankruptcy, I do not know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are seeking to do is to provide an opportunity for people who have suffered from a degree of misfortune, who have certainly had their lives prejudiced by being bankrupt, and who may, in consequence, have tried partly to bury their past, to try to get out of this inordinate difficulty, bury the past as far as is humanly possible and take a full part in society once again. I think that we have to deal with the majority of such people in theway these provisions allow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that some people prefer to be in prison because it is a convenient place to be at Christmas, but one has to deal sensibly with the law in such matters, and I feel that the overwhelming majority of bankrupts will welcome the opportunity to make a fresh start in life. If there is a minority who behave somewhat differently in this respect, well, we cannot cater for every whim of the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point that the Minister makes, and it may well be that some people prefer to be in prison at Christmas. The interesting thing is that these people have shown by voting with their feet, so to speak, that these are considerable numbers of them who, though they might wish to be discharged. prefer not to go through the proceedings for discharge. We are told that there are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1136">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>337</span>
60,000 people who have preferred not to be discharged, although there are proceedings for discharge. I am asking, "Do they have the option?", and the answer is "No. They will be discharged whether they like it or not."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, well, that is facilitating the position of those who want to be discharged but who feel that having their situation revealed is too traumatic an experience. But when we think of the publicity and the facilitation of the processes of law that will arise from these changes, we can only hope that we are doing something to cure a growing and difficult social problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can only do our best. If we were to make our determination on the basis of the sullen, difficult or shy smaller proportion of pcople who do not in any sense wish to change from being undischarged bankrupts, we would be making an erroneous judgment, and I do not think any member of the Committee wishes to follow that course. The hon. Gentleman has made a point, and I am grateful to him for having drawn attention to an aspect of the problem which all of us may have overlooked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 6, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 7</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>DISQUALIFICATION OF DIRECTORS OF INSOLVENT COMPANIES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 58, in page 6, leave out lines 4 to 9 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(i) is or has at any time during the six months preceding the date of the commencement of the winding up thereof been a director of an insolvent company which is being or has been wound up; and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(ii) is or has at any time during the six months preceding the date of the commencement of the winding up thereof been a director of another insolventcompany which is being or has been wound up and the winding up whereof commenced within five years of the date of the commencement of the winding up of the first-mentioned company; and".</p></blockquote>
This is an important clause. I do not think that there is any difference of
	<span class='label label-info column'>338</span>
opinion as to what it seeks to achieve, but there are essential and important differences of opinion about whether what is desired is achieved in the clause as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me say at once that I do not suggest that Amendment No. 58 provides a wholly satisfactory answer to the problem to which it is directed, but what it does do is raise directly for the Committee's consideration a very important issue which we must resolve before the Bill becomes law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment relates to the first part of Clause 7. It is an important provision because it will result, where applicable, in the disqualification ofa person holding the office of a director of a company. It is right that, if a person has shown himself unfit to hold that office, he should be disqualified. But it must also be recognised that that is a severe penalty and, therefore, we must be clear about the circumstances in which it is to be employed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic difficulty with Clause 7(1) is that, as it is drafted, it is not clear whether a man who resigned as a director the day before the crash is within the scope of the clause at all. He may have never been a director of an insolvent company which is being or has been wound up. Alternatively, if he is caught within the meaning of the clause, then so also is the man who ceased to be a director 10 years before the crash. One or other of those meanings must be wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two differences are these. First, it is not clear which meaning defines the position or which of those is the effect of the clause as it stands. Secondly, whether the effect is the first meaning postulated or the second, it is wrong either way. I said a moment ago that one or other of those interpretations must be wrong. It would be more accurate to say that both are wrong. It is difficult to justify either of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This point was dealt with in some detail in the memorandum of the working party to which I referred earlier and which is to be laid on the Table. As all members of the Committee do not have copies of this, I refer to page 4 of the memorandum which deals with this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. and learned Gentleman goes any further—he will appreciate that I have seen this memorandum—may I say that I am im-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1137">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>339</span>
pressed by some of the points made. I have not finally made up my mind about the situation and, so that I can assist him in the direction which he will now take, I would say that I want to reserve the position on this until the Report stage so that I may reconsider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:.I am very much obliged. That will shorten the matter. I am sure. But I think that the point is so important that we should have some discussion on it in the Committee. However, in view of the Minister's remarks,I shall confine myself to acquainting the Committee with what the working party said about it. It has put the point forcefully and clearly:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subsection (7) defines the winding-up as occurring on the date of the winding-up order or the passing of the resolution for voluntary winding-up, as the case may be. In these circumstances"—</p></blockquote>
and these are the sort of questions to which the Committee must address itself—
	<br><blockquote><p>"what does ' is being wound up', as used in subsection (1)(a)(i) and (ii) mean?"</p></blockquote>
From the Minister's remarks. I infer that he accepts that there may be somedoubt about what it means and, following that, he shares the view which we feel so strongly and which we keep repeating, that where it is even possible that there may be a doubt about the meaning, we must apply our minds to getting rid of that doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The memorandum of the working party continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is also objectionable to make substantive rights or disabilities dependon the date of the order, which may in its turn depend upon the exigencies of litigation, the state of the court list, the lpng vacation etc.".</p></blockquote>
That relates to subsection (7) and is a part of what the working party saidon this clause. The working party's memorandum then turns to Clause 7(1), which is the matter with which we are concerned in Amendment No. 58:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Further Clause 7(1) refers to a person being a director of an insolvent company which is being or has been wound up. Does this import a dual qualification, so that the person must at some date have been a director of a company which was at that date insolvent and which subsequently is being or has beep wound up: or does it mean that he must at some date have been a director of a company which was at that date insolvent and at that date being wound up‖?"</p></blockquote>
The working party points out that
	<span class='label label-info column'>340</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"if this is so, the second limb 'has been wound up' is inappropriate".</p></blockquote>
The memorandum continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…or does the provision merely lay down a single qualification that the person must at some date have been a director of a cpmpany which at a subsequent date became insolvent and is now being wound up or has now been wound up?"</p></blockquote>
Then, very helpfully for most of us, the working party gives examples in working terms which demonstrate clearly the doubts which it had in mind in the paragraphs which I have quoted. The memorandum gives two examples:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A resigns as a director of a company 24 hours before the presentation of the winding-up petition—is he within the provision?</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"B resigns as a director three years before the presentation of the petition—is he within the provision? Is he within it if the company was not insolvent at the date of his resignation?"</p></blockquote>
The working party goes on to express the view which I think we should all accept: "A"—that is the one who resigned 24 hours before the presentation of the petition—
	<br><blockquote><p>"A ought to be within"</p></blockquote>
the provisions;
	<br><blockquote><p>"B ought not, at any rate if the company was solvent at the date of his resignation. This is not the effect of the provision for A and B are treated in the same way but it is not in fact clear whether the provision applies toeither. A would argue that to be within the provision, he must at some timehave been a director of a company which was at that time both insolvent andin the course of liquidation; and he would point to the fact that any otherconclusion would lead to the provision applying equally to B. B's attempts to escape would thus be met by the argument that they would also enable toescape."</p></blockquote>
Before this memorandum was prepared, we had tabled Amendment No. 58 on the advice of an expert in this subject. We recognised then that while it resolved all those ambiguities. it did so by introducing an arbitrary time. The time was six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me say at once that the six months period was merely a cockshy—atalking point. I do not seek in this debate, nor at any stage, to justify that period. If somebody were to say that they accepted the need to get rid of ambiguities and that the only way to do it was by introducing an arbitrary time limit, which one often must do—with all the unsatisfactory consequences—and went on to say that the six months was wrong and theright time was either three months or a year
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1138">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>341</span>
and put forward arguments to that effect, we should certainly have open minds, and be ready to consider that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The working party has also put forward an alternative way of dealing with this problem which gets away from the introduction of an arbitrary time limit. This is set out in the part of the working party's memorandum from which I have quoted. I will not trouble the Committee with it, because I do not think one should expect the Committee to be able to pick up the effect of it simply by hearing it read out. It needs careful attention to study it in writing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, while I think that what the Minister is suggesting is a good idea—namely, that we ought to reserve the final decision about what we should do here until Report stage—because it gives us more time to getit right, I think it would be helpful if he gave us now, albeit briefly, his thinking on the matter. In particular, does he think that the main objection to our proposal—namely, the arbitrary time limit—can be overcome, while still adopting the same framework as we have adopted in the amendment, or does he think that the proposal now put forward by the working party is better in its basic approach but needs tidying up or amendment? If so, in what respect does he think it needs tidying up or amendment? If he does that, we can in the interim period do our part towards helping to arrive at the right solution. I hope he will be able to help us now on those which I believe are the main points which arise in connection with subsection (1) of Clause 7.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister replies, I should like to comment briefly on the amendment moved by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Southport (Mr. Percival). I accept that the purpose of the amendment is to tidy up the present loose drafting in the clause. and that inserting a time limit will go a long way to achieve this objective. Whether or not six months is the right time limit is a matter of detail about which the Minister will doubtless give his views now and. perhaps, think about more before Report stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However. I am unhappy about the whole of Clause 7. I am not certain that
	<span class='label label-info column'>342</span>
the amendment that my hon. and learned Friend has just moved goes sufficiently far to ease my unhappiness. It is always arguable that when a company is in danger of going insolvent and the board can see the rocks ahead, whether or not it is right for a director to resign. One can say—and this probably particularly applies to non-executive directors—that if they are well-known names and if they decide that they do not wish to be in any way associated with a company that may get into trouble and therefore take the decision to resign, that makes it that much more certain that the company will become insolvent. It will cease to be able to obtain credit and will be unable to go on trading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not certain what the hon. Gentleman is arguing. He should at this stage simply be arguing about the amendment. If he wishes to raise the general principle I think it would be more in order if he did it on "Clause stand part".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank you, Mr. English, for saying that. My difficulty here is that the purpose of the amendment is to insert a time factor during the six months. I must confess to my hon. and learned Friend that, while I can see that inserting a time factor deals with some of the loose drafting to which he referred, I am not certain that it goes a long way to clear up the difficulties that are inherent in his clause and in the subsection. It is difficult to say that, simply by putting in the time limit of six months.one will remove directors from the uncertain position that my hon. and learned Friend outlined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. I, in no way wish to limit the contributions which the hon. Gentleman is making. Indeed, it is not within my power to do so. But it presents a difficulty. Were we to discuss what is. in effect, "Clause stand part", I would have no objection. That would be fine. But it presents problems if we are not to do that. As I understand it, the hon. Gentleman is opposed to the whole concept adumbrated inClause 7. There is, therefore, a point of time to enable that to be done, and I invite your comments. Mr. English, about whether we widen the debate at this stage or leave it to the end.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1139">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>343</span>
which is the normal practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. English. Nobody could say that the discussion we have had has, in any way, tended to go over the sameground twice. On the contrary, we have been scrupulous, if we have discussed a point on an amendment, not to raise the same point on "Clause stand part". The Minister need not be worried about that. With great respect, however, the points my hon. Friend now makes are directly related to the amendment and are not the general point of principle. Any amendment may obviously have some relation to "Clause stand part", but my hon. Friend is on the question of the time limit. He makes the point that, while the amendment under discussion does something to clarify the position, it has some disadvantages which need to be taken into account. To my mind, he is in no way off the point of the amendment. It would surely be helpful to the Minister to have the comments on the amendment—and, indeed, those of my lion. Friend—in order to weigh up whether or not the amendment is satisfactory orto ascertain what needs to be done about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that is true. On a previous clause, I allowed generaldebate on a particular amendment. n this case, it does not seem to be a convenient amendment for that sort of a general debate, and I do not think that the Committee is of the unanimous opinion that we should have a general debate on this amendment. As for the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton), I do not think that he has been out of order, or I should certainly have said so. nitially, I made the point that I would listen to him with care but that he should relate his arguments to this amendment and that we would have the general debate on the principle of the clause at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. English, for your ruling and to my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) for his support, bearing in mind that the amendment to which I speak and which, in some degree, I criticise, is tabled in his name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I need not take up the time of the Committee much further. I wished to
	<span class='label label-info column'>344</span>
make the point—and I am sure that the Under-Secretary will take it on board— that by putting in a time limit at which the Minister has agreed in principle to look, we do not deal with the point that this is aimed at removing directors from the position of uncertainty in which they will now stand in relation to the severe penalties that will apply under this clause and which we will discuss in later amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to the point, which I hope the Minister will seriously consider, that directors of companies, when they see that the companies are potentially in trouble, will have great difficulty in deciding whether or not to resign. If they are given a time limit, and know that they must take this decision by a certain date because thereafter they may be subject to the severe penalties envisaged in this clause, their position could be made worse rather than better. They will see a hurdle ahead of them. They will know that, if they go over that hurdle, they will be involved with the company in its failure and that it will lead to the penalties spelled out in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find myself in grave difficulty overall about this clause for the reasons I have mentioned, and I am uncertain whether my difficulties will be solved by the introduction of this time limit, although it will clearly deal with the tidying-up point made by my hon. and learned Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I need delay the Committee unduly—indeed, at the invitation of the hon. and learned Gentleman I will notdo that, as I have already indicated that I think that the points that havebeen raised by the working party in its latest consideration of the matter,which reached me only a few days ago, deserve further consideration. Clearly, we are both anxious to avoid any misunderstanding if there is the possibility of ambiguity. On the face of it, the working party has put forward a statement deserving careful consideration, which it will receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the timing, the working party had said earlier that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the uncertainties of Clause 7 in its present form would be avoided by adoption of a fixed time period."</p></blockquote>
That had been its previous position. It now says:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1140">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>345</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"On further consideration, we appreciate the disadvantages of this method".</p></blockquote>
That flowed from the discussions with my officials. So that is not likely to be a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we can avoid the difficulty, but it would clearly be rather pointless for me to go into a long statement of how we shall do that before having given the matter the careful consideration that it deserves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the points made by the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton), to which I have little doubt he will return when we debate these issues more fully at a later stage, I do not share his anxieties about the situation. I think that on Second Reading he made an intervention to similar effect. I believe that there is a real problem here, on which, in principle at least, the professional bodies and ourselves are at one. We feel that there is a case for this additional sanction being imposed. There is a very real problem facing many people dealing with a person who sets up a company which, because of the way in which it is established, because of the way in which it is run, because of the fraudulent nature of the way in which the director goes about his activities and where his general conduct—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Leeds, South-East (Mr. Cohen) may not smoke in the Standing Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are some who make their absence felt on occasion for precisely that purpose, I understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where a director carries on his business in such a way as to make him unfitin the judgment of the courts, I think that society is entitled to some protection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has just said something very significant in relation to the clause and to the amendment. He has referred to a company where a director is fraudulent in the way in which he runs the company. That actually has nothing to do with the amendment, of course. But the danger of this clause is surely that it is not necessarily the director who is fraudulent in running the company who is disqualified. The onus of the clause is that anyone who sits on the board
	<span class='label label-info column'>346</span>
with that director may be disqualified. It is around that point that my concern about the clause and this amendment centres.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that both the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) and the Minister are at this stage likely to get themselves involved in the principle. I think it would be best if we stuck to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that this might be the problem. I was then, ofcourse, in difficulty in responding to the point made by the hon. Gentleman. In any event, the point he is making will be dealt with on a later amendment which he himself will be moving. I think it is right that he has signalled his anxieties and we have taken note of that. He will have a further opportunity to engage us on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I simply sum up this aspect of the matter by saying that we are taking intoaccount the point made by the working party, and I think it is right that we should come hack to this later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before he sits down, perhaps the Minister could say a word on this. I said that the criticism of the amendment was that it fixed an arbitrary time limit. It seems to me that my lion. Friend added a practical gloss on that. Where an arbitrary time limit is provided, there are bound to be difficulties arising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) referred a practical difficulty arising from the introduction of a time limit. If a director is put in this position, when a company is getting into difficulties the director may have to say to himself, where there is a time limit "I had better get out now while I can". That in itself may be the last straw that brings that business down, and that business might not have come down if the director had not been put in that difficulty but had been able to soldier on with the hope of restoring things. That is a very important point, not merely to that director, although goodness knows it puts him in a great difficulty, but it is a much wider point in that it affects all employees of that business, it affects the customers of that business, and so on. It seems to streng-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1141">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>347</span>
then the criticism which I made of my own provision on this aspect of our amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has told us that he will think again about this. Is he thinking again about a provision which has time limits, and therefore is clear? Or does he think that it is already clear that the difficulties raised by the introduction of an arbitrary time limit are such that we really must look for a different solution to the problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may speed the proceedings if I intervene before the Minister replies. May I add a further gloss to what my hon. and learned Friend had already said? It is not only that it is apparent that the director believes that something is going wrong. It is more precise than that. It is that he thinks it will go wrong completely within the time limit, or at the time limit, in effect. So it does have some rather precise implications. Obviously there are real problems there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to get a clearer statement from the Minister than we have had already on what precisely his intentions are, because his final few words were a little difficult to hear. There are essentially two points. One is what the possibilities are, and what the objections are, to various ways of solving the problem of this clause and the drafting thereof. The second is whether there is an ambiguity in the drafting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the first, we may all have views, and no doubt eventually the Government and ourselves will take a view about what is the right answer. But I hope that we are all agreed that we cannot simply leave it as it stands. Therefore, when the Minister gives an undertaking that he will look it, I hope he will be clear about the drafting and that he is also giving an undertaking that he will introduce an amendment on Report. I do not think that he can simply say that he will look at it on Report, and then, when that time comes, say that he has looked at it and cannot do anything about it, or alternatively, as often happens on Report, the matter is not raised at all because no amendment has been tabled.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had made the position clear. I was concerned about the ambiguities that appeared in the drafting. It is not possible for me to say, at this stage, that I will introduce an amendment, because I am not completely satisfied that the issues that have been raised by the Law Society justify an amendment. What I am saying is that prima facie they have raised a case. It is right that I should consider that situation in depth and, of course, by virtue of having said this, the opportunity for debate on Report becomes not too difficult to discern. I think, therefore, that it will be possible to raise the matter of the drafting later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the time limit, I thought that this was being abandoned by the hon. and learned Gentleman—that is, the six-month period. I would not push to import that into the provisions of the Bill. So to that extent, I think it raises—and I think the working party recognise this—a lot of problems. But because, so far as I can see, no one is urging this point, it seems to me to be a waste of the Committee's time for me to rehearse the argument against it. I shall therefore leave the matter there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I come back to that point? The Minister is perhaps not being quite fair to the representations which have been made. The hon. Gentleman said that he thinks that those who have made representations about ambiguity may have a point. I suggest that it is beyond doubt that they have a point in respect of ambiguity. If there is no ambiguity, the Minister should tell us what it means. As he cannot do that, on the basis of the two examples read out, there is clearly ambiguity. I do not see that that can be denied. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will give a clear undertaking on the matter, or even speed things up by saying that he has given a clear undertaking that he will introduce an amendment on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must recognise that what I said is that, without becoming too involved in the issue at this stage in Committee, there appears to me the possibility of ambiguity. But it is a difficult proposition. I want to consider the position further. I want to consider it with the working

	<span class='label label-info column'>349</span>
party. The nature of any amendment forthcoming will emerge from those considerations. I doubt whether we shall be in a position in which no amendment is forthcoming, but I have not had an opportunity to consider the situationsufficiently fully to give the Committee the sort of outline of any amendment which might be practical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be apparent to anyone who reads the record what is theposition; we shall certainly expect an amendment to be tabled by the Minister 011 Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the undertaking received, at least as to further consideration, I shall not press the matter further. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 36, in page 6, line 5, after" up ", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"subsequent to this Bill receiving the Royal Assent".</p></blockquote>
The simple purpose of the amendment is to ensure that Clause 7 does not apply retrospectively. Therefore, we seek in line 5 to make it clear that the provision applies to the first insolvent company, of which a person is a director, wound up after the Bill receives Royal Assent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Under-Secretary agrees that there should not be any element of retrospection in the clause. As the hon. Gentleman himself said, theprovision is putting a new and severe restraint on directors. If our amendment were not accepted, a situation could arise in which someone was a director of a company that was wound up four and a half years before the Bill was enacted. Subsequently the Bill receives Royal Assent, and that person has the misfortune to be a director of another company that is wound up in, let us say, six months' time. He could then find that, purely by virtue of the second company being wound up, he was subject potentially to the penalties of not being a director and not taking part in the management of a company for a period of up to five years thereafter. For anyone engaged in business, this is a severe potential penalty. I believe, therefore, that
	<span class='label label-info column'>350</span>
for there to be, potentially, this element of retrospection in the Bill is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment seeks to make totally clear that a retrospection element should not be there, and that a person would have to be a director of two companies both of which would be wound up after the Bill receives Royal Assent, and after every director knows about the new penalties, for the penalties to apply. I cannot believe that the Government wish any clement of retrospection to exist in the legislation. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will be able to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have to try to determine the objective of Clause 7. I hope that I shall not breach any rules of order in my remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we seek to do is to disqualify a person who, as the hon. Gentleman said, is not only a director but someone who is concerned in the management of a company—we shall come to that definition later—where two or more insolvent companies have been carried on by that director in a way to indicate that hc is unfit to be concerned with the management of such companies. These would be companies which had been wound up within the five-year period. It seems to me that the vast majority of directors will not be touched by the considerations to which the hon. Gentleman alluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the hon. Gentleman seeks to do would itself create an additional problem, namely, that already the clause as drafted permits a director who might come within the provisions at some stage, one bite of the cherry. He has one company and he is not touched by the provisions. But where he has been a director of at least two insolvent companies which have gone into liquidation, we take the view that it is right that society should be protected by a court of law, from the possible depredations of people who have indicated either fraudulent intent or have been negligent, and are unfit to continue to operate a company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's amendment would rule out any company where the winding-up had been completed before the Bill received Royal Assent; in other words, it would give the director an extra bite of the cherry. I maintain that in principle that is not right. The amendment would create an illogical situation. If two companies have winding-up orders
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1143">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>351</span>
made against them, or pass resolutions for voluntary winding-up on the same day, before the Bill receives Royal Assent, one may be wound up completely while the other is still in the course of being wound up, and the provisions of the clause would apply to the latter but not to the former. That is an illogicality which I suggest that the hon. Gentleman could not reasonably sustain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Raymond Gower</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Listening to the debate, I suggest that the Minister hasnot got the gist of my hon. Friend's argument. He said that the amendment'sprovisions would create three bites of the cherry. I agree that that would be so, for a transitory period—that is, only during the passage of the Bill. After that, it would be two bites of the cherry which the Ministermentioned. The position is surely only temporary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a long temporary position, and one which I should not have thought Committee members would wish to sustain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I suggest that the Minister misunderstands the
	<span class='label label-info column'>352</span>
argument advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton),which is essentially concerned with retrospection. Despite remarks made by the Leader of the House recently, this House has always been most reluctant to pass any legislation which has a retrospective element. That having been said, I accept that there are many different types of retrospection. Some are more objectionable than others. I should not wish to argue that the kind of retrospection with which we should be involved here would be one of the most objectionable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None the less, I suggest that the proposal is unnecessarily retrospective. If we are to change the law, surely there is a case for changing it in respect of future cases rather than to change it in such a way that someone suffers from something which took place before the law was changed. It may be that someone was in the position in which—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
