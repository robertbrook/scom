	<p>(1) The prescribed officer of any court which—
	<ol>
	<li>makes an order, after the coming into operation of this section, that a person shall not, without the leave of the court, be a director of or in any way, whether directly or indirectly, be concerned or take part in the management of a company for such period as may be specified in the order or</li>

	<p>This subsection applies whether the order is made under section 188 of the Act of 1948, section 9 of the Insolvency Act 1976 or section 21 above.</p>
	<p>(2) The Secretary of State shall, from the particulars with which he is furnished under subsection (1) above, maintain a register of such orders and of cases in which the court has granted leave.</p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed—</i>(27th July)That the clause be read a Second time.</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terence Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am recorded in 	<i>Hansard</i> as not having finished a sentence which I had begun when One o'clock struck on Tuesday. I am not clear that that was my intention. That last sentence had begun:
	<br><q><p>"The other point which arises here is that this register is not like some other records. It is quite
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>470</span>
specifically related to a person's business performance—(Official 	<i>Report, Standing Committee</i> C; 27th July 1976, cc. 466–7.)</p></q>
I rather intended that there should have been a full stop at that point. That being so it is important that we should give due consideration to the fact that it will be on the record that somebody's business performance has been such that he requires disqualification and to that extent is something which, if we are not careful, may result in the record remaining for all time, despite the intentions of the Government. I would not wish to say more. The Minister may wish to comment on some of the points I have made. It may well be that we shall wish to table further amendments to the new clause, if it is accepted, at Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Clinton Davis)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a difficult subject and one has to try to achieve a balance here between what is in the interests of the public at large and what may be, on the other hand, to the prejudice of the disqualified director. On balance, notwithstanding the difficulties which have been postulated by the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) and some of his colleagues, he, too, believes that the register is a necessary innovation in this respect. Therefore, having said that it is not possible to eradicate all the difficulties that may arise, I must be frank with the Committee at the outset on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman poses the question—who is likely to make use of the register? First, I think that, clearly, the Government will wish to use the register because it will be easier thereby to identify someone who has been disqualified. Clearly persons who are directly concerned with determining the status of a person will wish to use the register to make inquiries about them. Such persons must inevitably include creditors, shareholders and people who are involved in the management of companies who will wish to check on the status and credentials of certain individuals. There is a need for the register to exist to satisfy these requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman went on to reiterate the argument that there ought to be some form of separate register or, within the register itself, some compartmentalisation, as if one could determine some form of classification of people who had been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0922">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>471</span>
disqualified on the grounds—and there is already some measure of classification by virtue of what I have already told the Committee—that one form of disqualification is more heinous than any other. With respect, that is the wrong approach and I have said so on several occasions, but I do not seem to have managed to persuade the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will abbreviate what I had contended before by saying that it is for the court to determine within its discretion whether somebody merits the draconian treatment of disqualification. It is perfectly true that people who commit acts of fraud may merit that treatment while people who commit acts of persistent default may also merit it. If people really are behaving with a negligence of the sort that would merit disqualification by the court the public is entitled to know the sort of record they have. I do not believe there is any case for diminishing the purpose of the disqualification, which is part of the hon. Gentleman's argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that the register will include provision for dealing with the section under which the order was made, the period of disqualification and particulars of any leave granted by the court in relation to the order. That is the right way to go about dealing with the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more substantial points came later in the hon. Gentleman's remarks because he was concerned, as we must all be, with the position of somebody who has ceased to be disqualified, who has purged his disqualification in one way or another, and wants to restore himself to a reasonable and normal business life. The hon. Gentleman felt that the register might be a deterrent to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I might advert to the position of the maintenance of the register at this stage. It might be helpful to know how the Registrar actually sees the machinery working in this regard. It was a decision taken at an early stage of the micro-filming programme that the Registry would film only the last three annual reports on file at the date of the initial filming. Therefore the paper file contains the only complete history of the company. If a company is dissolved immediately after incorporation the Registry has to hold the file against the event of successful petition for restoration for up to 20 years after the dissolution is allowed. After that time the Public
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>472</span>
Records Office may select certain files. That deals in part with the question affecting the maintenance of certain documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) raised the question of somebody searching in 1979 for a record in 1977. The answer to that is that he will not be able to perceive in 1979 what the position was in 1977. More than that, I am advised by the Registrar that he proposes to have a card index bolted into drawers in alphabetical order so that someone would not be able to take a photocopy. The Registrar will get the same information on cards arranged in the order in which the disqualification took place so that he will be able to use that as a control when removing information from the Register.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand from what the Minister is saying that technically the Register will make it difficult to take photocopies by virtue of the fact that the cards on the register will be bolted into a drawer. Can we take it that there will be prohibition against taking photocopies and that if someone should turn up with a Minolta camera he will not be allowed to take photocopies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member did not allow me to complete what I was saying. Perhaps I should not have given way. I have spoken of control. At the point of the disqualification ceasing and by virtue of the machinery I have described both records are destroyed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Abuse is not limited to the situation to which the hon. Gentleman referred. I want to look carefully at the position but I do not pretend the answers are easy. In any event, it is not an unprecedented situation that one should have a register of this kind because in the county courts every judgment over £10 in value, with some exceptions which I will not go into as they are irrelevant, has to be registered and is open to public inspection. The register contains a record of both satisfied and unsatisfied judgments and there is no automatic removal once a judgment has been satisfied. It is true that at present there is a good deal of concern about this and the Lord Chancellor's Department is reconsidering the question of the register, not on the grounds of principle but on the grounds of the cost of its maintenance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been much concern expressed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0923">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>473</span>
by bodies concerned in this matter about the abolition of that register. There has been a suggestion that the register principle should be extended to High Court judgments, where it does not apply under the present law. I do not propose to go into a long philosophical argument about this question in relation to the philosophy of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act because hon. Members must familiarise themselves with the provision of that Act. I will look between now and Report at the position on safeguards against disclosure of information of a disqualification which has expired. I will look at it in the light of some of the sanctions that are in the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act. But I am bound to say, looking at it at first sight, that if we have to apply the same sort of principles we might be creating more difficulties for ourselves and we</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will recall that when we were debating Amendment No. 38 1 said that we agreed in principle that it should be a criminal offence for an officer of a company deliberately to give false and misleading information to an auditor. This clause fulfils our undertaking to that effect. It goes somewhat further than the original recommendations of the inspector's report on London and County Securities in that it makes it an offence to give false and misleading information to an auditor either knowingly or recklessly. This means that it will be an offence not only if an officer deliberately gives such information but if he does so not caring whether that information is true or false. Subsection (2) makes clear that the clause</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>474</span>
	<p>would not necessarily be advancing the public interest, which all hon. Members are anxious to assert.</p>
	<p>I will leave it at that, unless hon. Members feel there is any further explanation I should make. I have indicated that I will look at some of these problems between now and Report. It is not the first time we have looked at them and it may well be that in searching to advance the argument of achieving the greatest good for the public at large we may come up with certain anomalies which I shall not be able to cure. That I must concede to the Committee.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause read a Second Time, and added to the Bill</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>New Clause 20</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>FALSE STATEMENTS, &C. TO AUDITORS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>'(1) An officer of a company who knowingly or recklessly makes a statement which—
	<ol>
	<li>is misleading, false or deceptive in a material particular, and</li>
	<li>is a statement to which this section applies, shall be guilty of an offence.</li>
</ol>
	<ol>
	<li>This section applies to any statement made to an auditor of the company (whether orally or in writing) which conveys, or purports to convey, any information or explanation which he requires, or is entitled to require, as auditor of the company.</li>
	<li>Any person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or to a fine, or to both; or</li>
	<li>on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding £400, or to both.'.—(Mr. Clinton Davis.)</li>
</ol></ol></p>
	<p>applies only to information given to the auditor in his role as auditor. I think the Committee will agree that this is a necessary limitation. Otherwise, it would be a criminal offence for an officer to give false information to the auditor about totally extraneous matter, and that would be extremely undesirable.</p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>Subsection (3) sets out the penalties and—I make no bones about it—they are deliberately heavy because it is a serious offence for an officer of a company to seek to mislead the auditor. This can have very serious consequences for shareholders, employees and creditors alike. The penalties reflect the seriousness of the offence and the probability is that such an offence may be associated with fraud or at least a deliberate attempt to cover up unfavour
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0924">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>475</span>
able facts about the company's position or the behaviour of its officers.</p>
	<p>The new clause provides a powerful sanction against any attempt by an officer of a company to mislead the auditor. I think it will considerably strengthen the position of the auditor in his dealings with the company's officers, particularly if he has suspicions at any time of concealment of information that he ought to have. Therefore, it will provide additional protection for the interests of those dealing with the company.</p>
	<p>I have summarised the position. If any hon. Member wishes me to go into particulars of the subsection I shall be pleased to do so, but I hope it will not be necessary.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We support the intent behind the clause and regard it as a reasonable provision to write into the Bill. I have just two points to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first hinges around the word "orally" in subsection (2). Has the Minister thought of the difficulties that may arise for the auditor in subsequently proving that the statement was made orally to him by an officer of the company which he thought to be reckless? Surely there are potential difficulties here. One can imagine a situation in which an officer of the company would say in court "That is not exactly the way I put it. I was trying to give the impression about an underlying value of an asset which was my best judgment at the time". The auditor will have to prove, without a written record that it was something rather different from that. I think that there must be potential dangers in allowing oral statements to be caught under this subsection, for the reason that I have mentioned I should be grateful if the Minister would elaborate a little more on that and say how he thinks this danger can be covered, because this is an important departure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other point relates to the first subsection and the words "knowingly or recklessly". I understand what the parliamentary draughtsmen have tried to cover in those words, but I would like to hypothecate an imaginary situation to the Minister as follows. The auditors ask a director—who is, of course, an officer of the company—about the value of unquoted securities at the time of the annual audit. There is no known market for these. It is often difficult to assess what is the true value of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>476</span>
an unquoted security, particularly in a company which has recently started in business and where there must be an initial loss in the first year or so. The director has to make a value judgment as to whether, despite the initial loss, he thinks the company in which his company owns unquoted securities will come through and improve in the years ahead. This is a subjective matter, as all of us who have dealt with this situation know. Is there not a potential danger that once this clause is in being all officers of companies will be too careful as to what they say about the underlying value of, for example, unquoted securities because they will be fearful that if something happens in the days or weeks ahead which shows their judgment was wrong at the time they can subsequently be said to have made a reckless statement?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise fully that I am hypothecating what must be improbable examples, but it is important that the balance sheet should represent a true and fair view of the company's assets and losses. We must be careful that directors do not talk up the value of assets which are included and which are unquoted and for which the market value cannot be definitely established. We also want to make certain that they do not write them down and err on the side of conservatism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to receive the Minister's wholehearted approbation for one of my remarks. I meant conservative with a small C. One wants to be certain that they do not err too much on the side of conservatism, because there could arise a situation where investment companies would be hesitant to take on any unquoted company, which means venture capital, because they would be so worried as to how they would value that unquoted security to the auditor at the end of the financial year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that any of us are against the principle behind this clause, but on those two points about oral statements and words "knowingly" and particularly the word "recklessly" I do have misgivings because more may be caught within the clause than is intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cecil Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the intention behind the clause. A great deal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0925">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>477</span>
of store is set by the signed balance sheet when it is produced, and even the most alert auditor is at an enormous disadvantage if he is faced by directors who are determined to mislead him. It is very difficult, indeed, for an auditor to catch out a director who is determined that he should get a false story. I have in my own experience seen some incredibly complicated and carefully documented frauds perpetrated which are very difficult indeed to unravel unless one has a stroke of great good fortune as well as being assiduous. I think that a clause of this kind will strengthen the position of the auditor and produce a better situation than the one that at present exists. I have no hesitation—subject to the interesting and worthwhile qualifications of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) to which I look forward to hearing the Minister's answeri—in welcoming the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) is concerned about the question of oral evidence, but this is not unknown in the courts of this country. Of course it is more difficult in certain instances, particularly where it is the word of one against the other, to establish the credibility of evidence. But, notwithstanding, the difficulties in relation to matters of evidential value, I think it is essential that we should have this additional provision for the reasons which have been advanced by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Hertfordshire, South (Mr. Parkinson).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the situation would be satisfactory if we adulterated the clause by eliminating the oral evidence aspect. We would then have the position that evidence which could be corroborated—it is not necessarily the case that only one individual may hear what is said, because it may be confirmed by a number of other witnesses—would not be admissible if the hon. Gentleman's fears were reflected in an amendment along the lines of his speech. I do not think that there are any great potential dangers in this respect because it is not unprecedented by any manner of means as far as the law is concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as the question of "knowingly or recklessly" is concerned, one has to remember that offences under this new clause, like any other offences in relation
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>478</span>
to the criminal law, will have to be proved to the satisfaction of the court beyond any reasonable doubt, and that remark applies equally to the hon. Gentleman's worries about the admissibility of oral evidence. The term is well precedented. For example, it appears in Section 63 of the Insurance Companies Act—reckless misstatements to induce people to take out insurance contracts—and in Section 3 of the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act 1958.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recklessly, as I indicated when opening this debate, means making a statement not caring whether it is true or false, so it has to depend on the particular facts revealed in each case as to whether there was such a degree of recklessness as to amount to the commission of a criminal offence. I hope the hon. Gentleman will feel that that safeguards the position. He has posed a hypothetical question, and I do not think that when dealing with amendments to the law one can deal with that sort of hypothetical issue. Suffice it to say that if a director had made an honest attempt to value the shares he would not be liable for an error of judgment. There is a world of difference between making a statement recklessly, not caring whether it is true or false, and simply erring in a matter of judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept entirely the arguments that have been adduced by my ally on so many occasions, the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South (Mr. Parkinson). It is a great pity that he should wear the cloak of a Whip on certain occasions, but there it is. I must not embarrass him too much—he is blushing—but he speaks with the authority of being an accountant, someone who has a professional expertise in this matter, and I think the Committee ought to take into account that expertise, which I assure hon Members is reflected by the opinion of the professional body concerned which is as anxious as we all are in this Committee to make sure that we have auditors who are able to carry out their important duties of safeguarding those interested in the company and to do so objectively and without fear of intimidation or of being misled. This provision will, I think, strengthen the powers that they have very considerably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Obviously it puts the need for discrimination on to the courts because we are inevitably dealing with problems where discretion and judgment have to be brought in. Much else needs to be done to strengthen the position of the auditors and to give greater powers to the people in the joint stock company who have supervisory responsibility. This clause seems a decisive step forward and I welcome it wholeheartedly.</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall not need to discuss New Clause 17 in the name of the hon. Member for Luton, East (Mr. Sedgemore). That raises separate issues and there is no danger that we shall duplicate the arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are important new clauses and it is right, although we are anxious to make progress, that I should put them in context and set out the Conxervative view of these matters—indeed, if I were being rather pompous, I would say the Conservative philosophy. I am second to none in believing in the private enterprise system and the profit and loss motive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say, "profit and loss" because too often people think of the profit motive without taking account of the fact that those who take part in business do so at considerable risk and suffer losses. We have a tax system which taxes profits heavily and makes no allowance if the venture fails.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point I want to stress is, given the position I have outlined, that it is essential we should have a framework of law within which private enterprise can operate, which is designed to prevent abuse and to protect the interests of shareholders and others. It is no part of the Conservative approach to condone or encourage abuses. The only people who gain from having a framework which is not adequate are those opponents of capitalism and the mixed economy who would wish to exploit the publicity given to any such abuses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this point it is right to stress that the amount of publicity which attaches, for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>484</span>
example, to reports of the Department of Trade inspectors or inside dealings or warehousing, with which these amendments are designed to deal, greatly exaggerates the extent of such abuses which are few and far between. By and large the system does not result in any great abuse, is greatly to the benefit of this country and is responsible to a great extent for the wealth on which we all depend, not least for our social services and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was right to bring out that aspect and to emphasise that I am not seeking to suggest that the matters dealt with in these clauses are as widespread as the publicity attaching to some of the more controversial aspects of the system would suggest. It is also extremely important, in seeking to reform the system, that we should not do so in a way which would handicap the market either by adding to the volume of form-filling or bureaucracy, particularly as it would affect small business, or by putting restraint on the normal operations of the markets and especially on the marketing of shares on the Stock Exchange.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stressed at the beginning of this sitting that it is unfortunate that the Government have procrastinated for two years before going ahead with a number of the proposals in the 1973 legislation initiated by the last Conservative Government which fell with the General Election in February 1974. The Government have made it plain that although they propose to wait for the Bullock Report and to legislate on that, a major Bill on other aspects of company law reform could not be expected for a considerable time, perhaps for several years. I have frequently pressed the Government on this and particularly the Leader of the House. He is too anxious to press forward with measures of nationalisation rather than the reform of company law to give early attention to the need to reform some of the law on corporations. In that context I was mildly surprised to read on the front page of the 	<i>Financial Times</i> this morning that the Government intend to give priority to these matters. I should welcome that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that two matters deserved particular attention: insider dealing and warehousing. Both are technical expressions. I tabled amendments on insider dealings and I have had discussions since doing so. None of us would under-estimate the difficulties but it is worth quoting from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0929">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>485</span>
the document "The Panel on Take-overs and Mergers". It says:
	<br><q><p>"The views of the Panel and The Stock Exchange regarding insider dealing were set out in the joint memorandum of February, 1973. The Panel's attitude to the problem of insider dealing is the same today as it was at that time; in particular, it considers that such dealing, properly defined, should be made a criminal offence, enforcement being in accordance with normal Companies Acts practices."</p></q>
Nonetheless, having had consultations, and I understand the Government have been engaged in this too, one realises the tremendous difficulties of drafting such a clause. We are not yet in a position to debate the matter adequately so I hope very much that in view of the Government's new-found priorities on these matters, they will press ahead with the solution as rapidly as possible. There is always a danger that outside interests will think that action is not urgent whereas in this case the Government should carry out consultations as swiftly as possible and we should return to thise as soon as they have been completed. I hope it is possible to draft this without incurring damage to the legitimate interests involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the question of warehousing which is a practice covered by the clauses. It is important not to exaggerate the extent of this. Nevertheless it should be dealt with. The Take-over Panel document to which I have referred defined warehousing as follows:
	<br><q><p>"The term warehousing, as the Panel understands it, is the practice whereby a person or company (or a group of persons and/or companies) accumulates, without public disclosure, a substantial block of shares in a company with a view either to making a take-over bid or to selling the block to someone else who then makes a bid. The Panel shares what it believes now to be the commonly held view that this practice is undesirable and should, if possible, be prevented by law."</p></q>
These amendments have been on the Order Paper for some weeks and I have not heard from anyone who believes that warehousing should not be dealt with. It is right that we should not delay legislation. I hope that the Minister will say that the Government are able to accept these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One or two points need to be dealt with specifically. One is covered by the amendment to the clause and deals with the position of jobbers. It is important that we should not inhibit normal dealings and I hope that the amendment will achieve my object that the position of the jobbers
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>486</span>
should not be prejudiced if the clauses are accepted by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have an important strategic decision implicit in the amendments. I believe that the argument for regulation, not by statute but by non-statutory bodies, has real advantages. It is set out in the document to which I referred where it is stressed that:
	<br><q><p>"Fair dealing and equal treatment as between shareholders must exist and be seen to exist and it must be possible to carry out transactions with speed and certainty. Since a take-over bid is a special situation for the securities of a listed company, it is essential that the highest ethical standards of conduct be maintained by those engaged in such transactions."</p></q>
The matters we are dealing with are highly complex and extremely difficult to deal with by legislation, but a legislative framework is necessary. If action is to be taken with speed and flexibility, a body of the kind of the Panel on Take-Overs and Mergers, combined with the City Code is more effective and a better way to deal with the problems than to establish some enormous statutory machinery. Therefore it is only in cases where such a body fails that legislation is necessary. I should not like to see any significant extension of the statutory framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I leave on one side the question of Department of Trade inquiries which has caused a great deal of interest in the past few weeks. We may be able to debate that on a later new clause. Having left that on one side, the position is that there are real advantages in flexibility and speed of decision. We have only to look at whether it is possible to amend the City Code as need requires, and compare it with some statutory provision which often would not get amended for years or decades. We can see how much more flexible is the kind of system we have. A statutory body would tend towards more detailed regulations and inevitably those who intend to breach the regulations will find a way of threading through a mass of detail in a way which a flexible code could prevent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the law needs to be tightened up in certain respects and we have therefore drafted these clauses. They are based on our legislation of 1973 although we have sought to bring them into line with subsequent changes and we have made particular provision about jobbers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time it is important to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0930">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>487</span>
stress that I should be very surprised if the wording of clauses of such complexity were perfect. I have no doubt that if the Government feel that they should accept them they will have to consider between now and Report whether anything in them needs tidying up. One point brought to my notice concerns institutional investors and insurance companies. It is suggested that the limits in the clause will considerably increase the administrative burden of notification by large institutional investors. This may be a problem where they are expanding their interest in smaller companies, which I think is a good thing. There may be a need to consider whether, in that context, a series of limits or thresholds might be more appropriate, rather than an absolute level. One would need to consider that against the efficacy of the new clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister knows, the new clauses contain provisions for altering the limit. I hope that that gives sufficient flexibility to change in the light of experience, if necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We ought also to consider the matter further between now and Report because I should be surprised if we have managed to draft the clause with the utmost perfection. It is rarely given to Oppositions to draft things with the utmost perfection, other than those which alter a number or run to one or two lines. I shall be pleasantly surprised if we have managed to do that in a matter that runs to several pages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should consider whether the same time period is appropriate for institutional investors, particularly those with overseas investments. I do not think this affects the fundamental objective of the clause, which is to tighten up the legislative framework in a particular respect. The present institutions are the right ones, and it is better to have them than a statutory body which would have the disadvantages to which I have alluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 	<i>Financial Times</i> suggests that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>488</span>
Secretary of State for Trade takes the view that I have expressed, and I hope that that is so. I think that it is to the advantage of the system that we should have a framework of law to deal with problems which, in the nature of things cannot be dealt with by a non-statutory body. I hope that the Minister will be forthcoming in his reply on this point and will feel that these matters should be given greater priority and not delayed for an indefinite period, as he seemed to be suggesting earlier on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard from the hon. Gentleman more than once the argument that the Government have been guilty of serious delay in introducing changes in our company law. I have told the Committee—and we have had the opportunity of debating on the Floor of the House matters affecting company law—that quite clearly there will have to be dramatic changes in company law over the next year or so. Quite clearly, too, it would be wrong to introduce changes of a substantial nature in the traditional company operation and perhaps within a year make further major changes. It would be very difficult, not only for people involved in the management of companies but also those who advise them in a number of capacities, to assimilate the changes. We have taken the view that because the Bullock Committee will inevitably make recommendations of a fundamental character, it is right that we should reflect upon those recommendations and base our next stage of legislation upon those changes which will basically affect the duty and responsibility of directors and of companies. I do not think that the charge is made out so far as the practice is concerned. The hon. Gentleman ran into a huge difficulty over insider dealing and found it necessary to withdraw the amendments that he had tabled some time ago as a result of representations no doubt made to him about the partial ineffectiveness of this company provision and, the need to reflect further and come, if at all possible, to the right decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While we all agree that the abuse of insider dealing needs to be dealt with by legislation which makes it a criminal offence, the way in which we deal with that has to be precise because it will be a criminal offence, and to introduce legislation which renders it virtually impossible to obtain a successful prosecution would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0931">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>489</span>
bring the law into contempt. We must have an enforceable sanction to counter the abuse and as the hon. Gentleman has discovered, that is no easy thing to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a great deal of criticism of the legislation in 1973, and subsequently. My basic submission to the Committee is that one cannot deal with insider dealing in isolation. The hon. Gentleman adverted to that. It is part of the pattern by which one deals with the supervision on the securities market. It has to be examined against a background of the overall arrangements for the supervision of the securities market. We have to determine the dividing line between statute and self-regulation, and the hon. Gentleman referred to this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me say in parenthesis that I hope the hon. Gentleman will retain an open mind about this until the Government's inquiries which are directed to a large number of interests both inside and outside the City are completed, and he will then have an opportunity of reflecting on the submission that the Government make. It cannot be right to accept unquestioningly the verdict of the City in these matters, which I felt was implicit in some of the remarks made by the hon. Gentleman this morning. We must have an effective means of enforcing the legislation because without that the legislation would be ineffective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are undertaking a review of arrangements for the supervision of the securities market, and we propose to publish our conclusions before the end of the year, probably in a White Paper—albeit in some respects with a greenish tinge—in which we shall set out our proposals on legislation for insider dealing, and we would hope to legislate as soon as possible after that. Possibly immediately after Bullock we should pass legislation to deal with this abuse. It may well be a convenient vehicle for remedying the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the point which was made by the hon. Gentleman and which underlies the new clauses. He did not go through the new clauses, and I do not complain about that, because he rightly sensed that they may be inadequately drafted in the light of further experience and the consultations that we have had and which we shall continue to have before Report. I, too, shall not go into the detail of the clauses. I shall try to set out what I under-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>490</span>
stand to be the purpose and principles underlying the clauses and some of the amendments that we hope to move at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Clause 10 is a useful, but I think one must admit relatively minor, contribution to the control of abuse in securities dealing. We feel that the 14-day period for notification of changes in directors' holdings in company shares provided under Section 27 of the 1967 Act is too long in practice. In order to increase the deterrent to directors indulging in insider dealing in companies' shares without the knowledge of the company, the period should be shortened. I should point out that the purpose of the amendment which we would propose is to impose the requirement to notify the Stock Exchange on the company rather than on the director.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the practice of the Stock Exchange to accept communication of company announcements only from the company. The clause would require the communication of information to come from the directors. It is frequently necessary for the Stock Exchange to authenticate messages before publishing them, and that would be difficult if the notices were to be received from individuals rather than from companies. We therefore propose that the company should be required to notify the Stock Exchange of information given to it by directors. We shall have to look at the question of the additional period that should he allowed beyond the initial three-day period, for the company to notify the Stock Exchange, but I hope the hon. Gentleman will feel that that may be a useful amendment to the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Clause 11 tightens up the requirements of the 1967 Act concerning the disclosure of beneficial interests in the voting shares of listed companies. Unquestionably. the effect of the new clause will be to make it more difficult to abuse the nominee system. I do not want to go into the merits or otherwise of the nominee system. We are dealing with the abuse of warehousing, which the hon. Gentleman quite rightly defined, and the affect of the clause will be to make it more difficult. It will mean that a bigger concert party—I think that is the term used in describing these matters; people acting in concert rather than at the end of the pier, though perhaps that is where they ought to go sometimes and fall off—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That is the purpose of both our aims here, and I hope that they will not be frustrated by events in practice. We shall have to see how it operates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is acceptable in principle but there are a number of matters to which we shall have to direct our attention between now and Report. The first question is that the lowering of the threshold for disclosure will increase greatly the number of events that will have to be notified once the threshold has been passed. Every purchase or sale, however small, has to be notified to the company. There is, therefore, a danger that companies will be flooded with notifications which will have little or no significance. That is something that we must avoid, because one of the dangers of flooding a company with notices of insignificant events is that one may swamp the significant events. We should consider altering the clause to require notification only of significant changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman has obviously been alerted. He moved an amendment which I do not find wholly satisfactory. I do not think that he would necessarily have expected me to have come to that conclusion. There are a number of problems of a technical nature that will have to be tackled. We shall talk to members of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>492</span>
Stock Exchange and others and seek to resolve these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I new refer to the question of jobbers. This is clearly a case for the exemption of jobbers. It is not clear from the drafting of the amendments whether the intention is that jobbers should be exempt from the requirement to notify when they hold between 5 per cent. and 10 per cent. of the company's share capital or should be exempt whatever the size of their holding—that is to say above 10 per cent. Again this is a matter in respect of which we must engage in consultation. It is too early to arrive at a conclusion. We have the best part of two months within which to do that. No doubt the hon. Gentleman will give consideration to that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to New Clause 12. This clause enables companies to go behind holdings in the names of nominees and find out who are the beneficial owners. Therefore it is an important supplement to New Clause 11. It enables nominee names to continue to be used for ligitimate purposes but makes it possible to frustrate the misuse of nominees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause, while desirable in principle, has a number of limitations on its effectiveness. If an overseas nominee is involved with a Swiss bank account the clause will be ineffective as there will be no means of enforcing the requirement to disclose upon a nominee outside the United Kingdom. That is one of the matters that must be looked at as part of the securities review that we are undertaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are practical problems. The clause assumes that a person always holds shares, either as the beneficial owner or as nominee. That is not necessarily correct, either. It is possible to hold shares as a mortgagee. That is another matter on which we must reflect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have pointed out some objections. There are others. However, I do not propose to go further into the matter unless I am pressed by the Opposition. We are prepared to accept the clauses for the purposes of this Committee's proceedings. However, we shall propose on Report to undertake to introduce a number of amendments which I think will go a long way towards clarifying some of the anomalies which the clauses, as drafted, present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This clause will permit any company limited by shares to issue shares having no nominal amount payable thereon. In layman's language, this would permit any limited liability company to issue shares with no par value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was so struck by the way in which the Minister accepted in principle the important new clauses that were moved by the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) that I hope he will accept this new clause in principle. I am not totally happy with the drafting but I hope that it will be acceptable to the Government. There are certain provisos that need to be added to it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0935">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>497</span>
and which we may deal with on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before coming to those provisos I should like to talk briefly about the principle behind my wish to enable limited liability companies to issue no par value shares. The present situation of par value shares leads to a great deal of misunderstanding, especially among the public who subscribe to the shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment in the case of a rights issue, we often read in a public document that the rights issue is being made of shares with a nominal value of 21/2p, but they are being issued perhaps at 125p when the market price is 150p. The only fact that may concern the potential investor at that time is the 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. discount below market value. To someone who is not accustomed to the jargon, it is reasonable for him to ask what is this business about a nominal value of 21/2p when he is asked to subscribe to shares at 125p. This misunderstanding becomes even greater when we consider the placing of shares in a new company, perhaps raising venture capital for oil drilling in the North Sea. Under such circumstances it is normal to issue shares for part payments. The situation may arise where shares are issued for 100p part value and the issue price is 125p. But the first part payment is 30p. The merchant banker, or whoever is behind the issue, puts in the issue document that the first part payment is to be 30p and, of that, 25p is part payment of nominal value and 5p is part payment of premium. Although I have been concerned in at least one such issue, I have never understood exactly how those behind the scenes arrived at the distinction between the part payment of nominal value and the part payment of premium. It is done as a purely arithmetical exercise so that at the end of the day the whole of the 125p—that is the issue price—will be subscribed. To the laymen it is confusing, indeed incomprehensible, to know why it is a 30p initial payment, of which 25p is the part payment of nominal value and 5p the part payment of share premium. Therefore there is a genuine background of misunderstanding and confusion which at the moment surrounds the whole issue of nominal values.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of the issue of shares of no par value has a substantial history in this country. Twenty years ago the Cohen Committee reported that:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>498</span>
	<br><q><p>"While there is, in our view much logic in the arguments in favour"</p></q>
of the issue of no par-values,
	<br><q><p>"there is considerable opposition … This class class of share has given an opportunity to the unscrupulous to manipulate accounts. We therefore refrain from recommending any change."</p></q>
That was the verdict of the Cohen Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsequently in 1954 a committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Montague L. Gedge, Q. C. reported that the abuses to which the Cohen Committee referred formed part, in its judgment, of the early history of the system in the United States, but that they had long since been overcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsequently the Jenkins Committee looked at this question in June 1962. Although it did not consider that there was an immediate call for the issue of no par value shares, it took much advice and received many comments on this issue. I should like to read one or two of those comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Society of Investment Analyists gave its evidence as follows:
	<br><q><p>"This Society can see many advantages of a purely practicat nature in favour of no par value shares—furthermore it would welcome any step which would prevent unsophisticated investors from deludipg themselves that the par value of a share had any bearing on its true worth."</p></q>
I believe that is an important point. Many people believe that the par value of a share has a bearing on its true worth. It does not. It is simply a balance sheet symbol.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Association of British Chambers of Commerce, which also reported to the Jenkins Committee, said:
	<br><q><p>"Law should permit the issue of no par value shares but not insist that companies adopt the method."</p></q>
The Council of Associated Stock Exchanges was in favour of shares of no par value. The Chartered Institute of Secretaries gave evidence and said that it was desirable to amend the Companies Act 1948 so as to permit this. Therefore, at that time there was a substantial body of professional opinion building up in favour of no par value shares. Nothing has happened in the meantime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to summarise in practical terms the advantages of no par value shares as I see them. They represent a share of what is genuinely a fraction of the equity and they do not impart a notional total value. The par value of a share has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0936">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>499</span>
no bearing whatsoever on its true worth. No par value shares make it impossible to relate the dividend to a nominal capital and thus they avoid the source of misunderstanding and misrepresentation. I shall return to that point in dealing with the objections to no par-value shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that with no par value shares, the company's distribution policy and the shareholders return on the money they have put into the company, will be seen in a much clearer prospective than in a situation of par value shares. It is the capital employed—and not the paid-up share capital—which is the true capital of the undertaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The shares of no par value would in certain cases facilitate the raising of additional capital. I should like to elaborate on the last point. Under Section 57 of the Companies Act 1948 the issue of shares at a discount below their par value is so hedged round with conditions—notably the need to call a general meeting of the company and to obtain court sanction for that move—that few companies have attempted to do it. However, a situation arose at the end of 1974 when the stock market was at such a low ebb that the shares in a number of leading companies were below their par value. Those companies had a sound future. They were in a position when they might need to raise new equity capital for their continued success and growth, even for their continued survival. As a result of the provisions of Section 57 of the 1948 Act they might not have been in a position to do so without going to court—which companies are understandably reluctant to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of 1974 the clearing banks, when, in one or two cases, their shares were below par value, could well have found themselves in the position of needing rights issue money both to deal with the effects of inflation on their deposit liabilities and with the write-offs on their loan portfolios. But, because of the restrictions of Section 57 of the 1948 Act they would have found it difficult to raise new equity capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That situation has in large degree been mitigated since then because, with the rise in the equity market, the situation of leading company shares lying below their
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>500</span>
par value has to a large extent been removed. Although that situation has disappeared since the end of 1974, it is no reason for not trying to legislate now to deal with a situation that could arise again 	<i>in</i> future years with the equity market at a low level. The prime opposition to the proposal has come from the TUC in the past. Mr. W. B. Beard wrote a minority report to the Gedge Committee Report which largely supported the view of the TUC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The opposition seems to be based around the point that shares of no par value are feared because it is thought that they may conceal what is happening inside public companies and camcuflage the payment of excessive dividends. This point no longer has substance. Most companies now delare their dividend as so many pence per share. The figure that investors look at is the pence per share and what yield this beings to them in relation to the market price. The fact that it may be 100 per cent. or 200 per cent. on the original par value is no longer relevant to the investor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Returning to the example which I quoted, of a rights issue in shares having a nominal value of 21p being issued at 125 per cent., one might well expect, perhaps, a dividend of 5p which would be 200 per cent. on the nominal value but which would show only a yield of 4p on the rights issue price. That is the sort of basic calculation we see in the market today. The fear represented in the past that going on to no par value may conceal what is happening inside the company with excessive dividend distribution policies, is no longer relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally I deal with two or three provisos in regard to the issue of NPV shares which have not found their way into this new clause and which, if the clause were accepted in principle, ought to be included for consideration on Report. The first is that shareholders should approve by special resolution the change to the issue of NPV shares. I would not want a board of directors to move in this way without the shareholders' blessing in general meeting. The second proviso—raised in the Godge Report—is that capital raised should be applied only to capital account. That is important and worthy of detailed consideration. The third proviso is that no company should be obliged to change to the system. It would be up to them
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0937">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>501</span>
whether they wish to do so and whether, having considered the advantages I have mentioned, they thought this was a worthwhile innovation. On balance I think there is a strong case for moving to permit companies, with the provisos I have mentioned, to issue NPV shares. I hope the new clause will, in general terms, find favour with the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will make three brief points. First of all, the previous Government, in their 1973 White Paper, concluded that legislation on this subject would not be justified by the potential benefit to be gained from it. If I may don the inquisitorial robes so frequently flaunted by the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) I would like to know what evidence the hon. Member has that there is any change in that situation. What oral, or for that matter written, representations has he received? What is the source of those representations? What authority do the bodies making those representations have? Has he authenticated those bodies? I hope he will be able to answer the same sort of question frequently directed to this side by his hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause, even if the purpose which the hon. Member outlined were one that the Government could accept—which we could not—is totally inadequate. I do not know what it achieves. If we were to legislate to permit NPV shares legislation would clearly need to be extensive and would need to cover a variety of important issues—for example the manner in which existing companies could convert capital with nominal value into shares with no par value, whether a company could have both kinds of capital, how such capital and expenses should be handled in the balance sheet, the treatment of conversion to NPV shares, the takeover of one company by another when one company has shares at no par value and the other does not, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I have done enough to indicate that the introduction of NPV shares is a complex and difficult matter which could not be dealt with in this Bill even if we were persuaded in principle that it would be desirable so to do. I doubt whether there is a strong enough case to justify legislation on the subject but we will consider it in the longer term review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am almost speechless
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>502</span>
with disappointment at the Minister's reply. What he did not deal with, and this is where my disappointment arises, was the Government's opposition to the principle of NPV shares. What does it emanate from? I said, frankly, earlier that I was not entirely happy with the wording of this new clause and accepted there should be additional provisos in it. To that degree, if one can have a probing new clause, this is such a clause. I believe that the principle of introducing NPV shares into this country and allowing companies to move to introduce them if they so wish is right. The Minister totally failed to deal with why he thinks it is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the legislation will be somewhat complicated, more complicated than envisaged in this new clause, but I believe it would assist companies in their equity-raising exercises if they had this option. The Minister must join with us in wishing to help companies raise equity from the market to further capital investment programmes. If he does not I shall be bitterly disappointed in him. He will be going against the remarks, made a number of times, by the Prime Minister. The Minister asked: Why introduce this new clause now when it was not in the 1973 Companies 'Bill? That is simply answered. The fall in the equity market was one event which highlighted the need of major companies to be able to raise equity capital by virtue of issuing NPV shares. This was the case at the end of 1974. It had not happened in 1972 and early 1973 when the 1973 Bill was presented to the House. Subsequent events, with the disastrous fall in the equity market at the end of 1974 and the perilous position in which this could have placed some new companies, highlighted, to our mind, the need to give them this opportunity and option to raise money through NPV shares if they so wished and if their shareholders agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that the Government have not seen fit to deal in any depth with the principle of NPV shares. I do not intend to press the clause because I am not totally content with its drafting. It is a little too simplistic. I would like to reserve the right to consult, I hope that the Minister will consult too, so that we shall have the opportunity to return to this matter on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In moving this clause I shall inevitably and unhappily be straying to the principles of Conservatism, ancient and modern. In that regard I was interested to hear what the hon.

This is what history will term the "Lonhro" amendment. Lonhro is the Tory Party at play. The play is unpleasant because the reality behind it is business and social fascism. This clause is designed to clean up the sewers of Lonhro and like companies which are infested not by vermin but by members of the Tory Party. The clause is about the scarred face of capitalism—a face which is so objectionable to the right hon. Member for Sidcup (Mr. Heath) but so pleasing to Members of the Shadow Cabinet and the 1922 Committee, led at one time by the right hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. du Cann).

This is a clause to protect workers and shareholders from the predations of directors and the incompetence and dishonesty of a minority of auditors. I use the word "protect" hesitatingly because all the clause does is to put workers and shareholders on their guard by ensuring they know what is going on. To be really effective the clause needs to be backed by other measures dealing with back-scratch
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>504</span>
ing, and, to use the famous words of the Lonhro Report sharing the action, insider dealing, warehousing, corruption and the like. Traditionally shareholders and workers have looked to the board and to the auditors for protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lonhro shows how the safeguards that should be provided by members of the board and auditors can get lost in directors breaking international and British company law in support for treachery and treason, in gravy train directors giving each other "a share of the action", and in directors deceiving both shareholders and other directors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was summed up in the 	<i>Observer</i> by Robert Heller, editor of 	<i>Management Today,</i> as follows:
	<br><q><p>"You need standards elastic to the point of absence to accept without qualm the use of funds belonging to public shareholders to buy extravagant pads for fortunate executive directors, to award lavish sums in compensation' to a consul t-ant on his elevation to the post of chairman; to provide massive overdrafts for a rich chief executive; to finance a large-scale transaction from which directors' family companies will benefit directly; and so on, ad nauseam, if not ad infinitum."</p></q>
Clearly, workers and shareholders cannot under existing legislation get protection from the board when it is the board members themselves who have their sticky fingers in the till; when it is the board members themselves who are fainting with greed in their maniacal pursuit of money, status and power; when it is the boar
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0939">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>505</span>
members themselves who lack standards, are without sensitivity, and are contemptuous of the people whom they purport to serve and the values of the society in which they live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, if the board is composed, as the Lonrho board was, of amoral figures from the Tory establishment who cannot tell right from wrong, then only by legislative means of which this modest new clause forms a beginning can we hope to protect shareholders—though truth to tell in the Lonrho case it is not at all clear that the shareholders wanted protection. In Lonhro personal greed was elevated to a principle and, if the right hon. Member for Taunton is to be believed, a principle to be inscribed on Tory tablets of stone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This new clause is designed to prevent directors like Tiny from treating directors such as Angus, Duncan and Alan as poodles; from treating them a little dogs with a licence, but greedy dogs with big appetites snapping and licking at Tiny's ankles. It will do so we hope because publicity in these matters is a great deterrent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am mindful of the fact that in the Lonrho case the directors were so brazen that even when their fiduciary impropriety was sprayed on their eyeballs they claimed not to see it. Instead, they turned on the Department of Trade inspectors who wrote this massive report—public servants whose only aim and object is to keep public life clean. Quite how one deals with the hysterical reaction of directors who talked in this report about saving their company with "bombs", "guns", "ammunition" and "gelignite", and how one deals with directors so hysterical that they talk about "rats" and "crucifixion" among their fellow directors I do not know. Perhaps Conservatives opposite who understand these character defects through their own experience can tell us what one does about this sort of thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think we have to turn to this sort of clause to deal with these sort of problems because if board members cannot protect shareholders and workers then traditionally they look to the auditors for protection, but the problem here—and it is recognised in the new clause—is that it is board members who, in practice, if not in theory appoint the auditors. All too often the auditors see themselves as creatures of the board, duty bound to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>506</span>
act in the image of the board, however unacceptable that image is. Indeed, we have a new process growing up in British companies. It is that auditors now not only get big fees for auditing companies and for being appointed by the board, but are doing massive consultative work for precisely the same boards. In other words, the whole structure between directors and auditors is becoming dangerously inter-linked, and workers shareholders and directors are not sure what is going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Lonrho case two firms, Peats and Fullers Jenks did not match up to their calling, because after money had been used illegally by Mr. Rowland the auditors were not put on their guard when Mr. Rowland decided to claim back £300,000 by putting in a backdated expenses claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the London and Counties Report, which I also have here, the Department of Trade inspectors reported that when Mr. Patient, an auditor for Harmood Banner became suspicious of Mr. Caplan. Mr. Caplan had him removed and the senior partners in Harmood Banner accepted his removal without a qualm. The auditors who replaced him negligently failed to discover that the accounts were grotesquely misleading as regards both the cash situation of the company and the true profit situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is against this background that compulsory disclosure by directors to workers, shareholders and board members of all financial and beneficial transactions relating to the companies that they run is needed. Directors must disclose the facts to auditors, and auditors must disclose the facts to workers, shareholders and board members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that in future we shall have to go further and set up a Securities Exchange Commission to deal with the whole ethos of share transactions, of standards of accounting, of financial dealings by managers and directors, disclosure rules, and other matters concerning transactions. We may have to look to a National Audit Service to get round these problems of auditors being appointed by the board and acting as consultants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people may say that it is to be regretted—and I almost suspect the right hon. Member for Worthing will say this—that the great entrepreneurs of our society should be subject to this new clause and the sort of physcological stresses suffered by the Lonrho directors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0940">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>507</span>
	<br><q><p>"It is the end, Tiny, I am afraid"</p></q>
Duncan said at the Lonrho offices on 19th April 1973.
	<br><q><p>"Angus has submitted his letter of resignation."</p></q>
Tiny broke down and spoke about "twenty murders" and then Angus said
	<br><q><p>"Quite frankly, my finances are so complicated".</p></q>
I bet they were complicated. These stresses are the other side of the modest rewards these people receive for watching the rest of us create the wealth of our nation before they subsequently consume it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one final factor about this new clause and it is that the Press seems to admire these guzzling, Nero-like entrepreneurs. But I wonder what the Vauxhall car workers, small shopkeepers, small business men, the blind and orphans in my constituency think about the unacceptable face of capitalism set out in the Lonhro Report, and this new clause is designed to deal with that face. I wonder what hon. Members opposite feel about the new clause designed to deal with that face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask hon. Members opposite to put behind them their shame, to show that they are Heath men, not Sandys men, Thatcher men, or du Cann men.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Crawshaw. It is an established convention of the House that if a personal attack is to be made upon an hon. Member he should be given notice of it.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not parliamentary practice to name Members unless notice has been given of the intention to do.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is my understanding that the right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Crawshaw. I really do not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>508</span>
think we can allow the situation to exist that the hon. Gentleman expected the Minister to inform my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Mr. du Cann) that he would be referred to today. The hon. Gentleman apparently did not inform my right hon. Friend direct. This is clearly a personal attack, and the usual conventions should apply. It is wrong for personal attacks of this kind to be made in this way without hon. Members being informed and therefore being able to decide what action they ought to take. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw what he said about specific hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Luton, West (Mr. Sedgemore) is entitled to make a personal attack without notice, but it is not customary. I do not think that his explanation is sufficient to cover that point and I hope that he is coming to the end of mentioning people's names. It does not help the proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Crawshaw. I did advise the right hon.

The right hon. Gentleman is not a member of the Committee, but within the next week or so he may have an cpportunity to debate the isuse himself. He is not disturbed about the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the right hon. Member for Taunton examines my speech he will find that there is no personal attack on him. The only attack is an implied one, in the sense that he stood up in the House of Commons a few weeks ago and said he was proud to be a member of this company. The attack has been on other members, and I had no duty to inform them I was raising this subject this morning. Before the hon. Member for Worthing imputes dishonourable or improper motives to anyone he should examine his own conscience, and perhaps will withdraw his remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand the hon. Member for Worthing getting touchy, because we are going to the soul and ethos of a much wider section of Tory society than a few upper-class twits. We are dealing with something real, with directors and auditors

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>509</span>
who are a shame and disgrace, and I ask hon. Gentlemen opposite to reject the philosophy behind the London and Counties Report, to reject the philosophy behind the Lonhro Report, to reject the philosophy which runs much wider amongst the elite our society and British establishment and to have the honesty to support this modest clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As no Opposition member has risen to speak I ought perhaps to add to my hon. Friend's speech—made, if I may say so, with characteristic moderation and judgment—a few observations about the situation as I see it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that my hon. Friend is entitled to be angry about the deliberate and frustrating attempt that has been made by officers of the company to camouflage or distort what was in the report, to camouflage and distort the seriousness of the criticism. My hon. Friend is entitled to be angry at the suggestion that has been made that if one is successful one ought to be above the law and sacrosanct in some way. I think that my hon. Friend is entitled to be angry, too, that if no boardroom dispute had arisen none of this murky story might have been divulged at all. Far from suggesting that Lord Duncan Sandys acted honourably in taking a tax-free compensation in the first place, it is hardly likely he would have returned it. Why, if he acted with such honour, did he give it back later?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has been entitled to comment on these absurd dealings revealed by the report and nobody, on reflection, would defend what has occurred: company secrecy, payment of huge sums to directors who went to their own exotic tax havens, expense accounts not properly investigated, or not investigated at all—and not just small petty cash vouchers, but sums like £307,000—directors getting a piece of the action, as stated in the report, houses on expense accounts—just to mention some of the allegations revealed by this meticulous examination by the inspectors upon whom a duty to investigate these matters fell. They discharged that duty, in my view admirably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, it is right that I should tell the Committee about the action that the Government are now taking on the basis of this report. As the Committee will know, the report has been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>510</span>
and it is for him to determine whether it contains evidence of breaches of the law and whether criminal proceedings should be instituted. I understand that the Director has asked the police to investigate certain specific matters, and it would not be right for me to say anything further about that aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My duty, or more particularly the duty of the Secretary of State, is to consider the implications of the report for company law. We have to determine whether it shows that changes are needed in the manner of the control of companies which should be exercised by the board as a whole and the manner in which the Lonrho company operated as a result of the failure of certain of its directors to keep the board fully informed and of the personal conflicts between the interests of directors and their duty to the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the report reveals any glaring and obvious gaps in the law. The inspectors have made no recommendation for an amendment of the law, and there would have been no doubt in their minds that if they felt that such changes were required they could have said so. The inspectors' criticism of the failure of certain directors to keep the board fully informed is important and may cause the Director to consider whether there have been breaches of the directors' duty under existing company law and whether there was a need to clarify or tighten up the existing provisions. The way in which the major policy decisions are taken by a company and the duty of directors are bound to be major elements in the company legislation we shall seek to implement, consequent upon the Bullock Report. The findings of the Lonrho Report are bound to be an important contribution to the study of this subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to say something about inspection procedures because a number of critical letters have been written to newspapers on remarks made by the right hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. du Cann) in a point of order that he raised on the day that the report was published. I shall say nothing about the propriety of the way in which that point of order was made, although I mentioned that to the right hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the discussion has been somewhat ill-informed about the purpose of company investigations. The system of inspection provided by the Companies
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0942">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>511</span>
Acts is, in my judgment, an important matter to regulate the basis of the relative freedom of companies with limited liability. The prime purpose of inspections under Section 165 of the 1948 Act is to establish the facts and whether 	<i>prima facie,</i> some irregularity has been shown in the way in which a company is managed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The facts when established serve a number of purposes. They are available to the Director of Public Prosecutions and other prosecuting authorities to decide whether they need to take action, and they are available to shareholders and creditors who can then use them in proceedings of a civil character which they may wish to bring. My Department has the facts established available to them in order to exercise the powers of the Department to bring civil proceedings for the recovery of company assets or to wind up a company. The facts established are available to investors, employees and others as evidence of the way in which the company is being run. Finally, they provide the Government and the public with a basis for discussion and action on aspects of company law reform. It is right that these matters should be revealed and not closeted away and hidden from the public gaze.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our inquisitorial procedures have attracted criticism. Some have not arisen entirely from disinterested parties, and the Committee would do well to reflect on the sources of some criticisms, but we must look at the position with an open mind. We must be chary of taking steps which may weaken the effectiveness of the enforcement of company law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This case and the London and Counties case are the exception rather than the rule. On average, there are 20 appointments of inspectors every year under the 1948 Act, and additionally 150 confidential inquiries are carried out by our own inspectors under Section 109 of the 1967 Act. Those are by staff employed by our Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a well-tried, regularly used, piece of enforcement machinery which is not lightly to be tampered with, and I doubt whether, if there had been less grave criticisms in this case, Mr. Rowland and others would have been so concerned about the illiberal procedures they said had been carried out. I suspect they would not have said a word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While we have to be sure that we are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>512</span>
applying the best procedures available, and there are bound to be anomalies, the fact is that these procedures have stood the test of time. While some improvements may have to be considered, we should not steer away from the facts revealed in the murky and sordid story of Lonrho.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I admit that when I read the new clause in the name of the hon. Member for Luton, West (Mr. Sedgemore) I had a great deal of sympathy with it. I have said before that I felt the position of the auditor needs to be strengthened, and if the auditor were to have the right to obtain all the information he required and the powers—he has most of them—and then make disclosures, many of the things that have been happening would stop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If anything emerges from the report, it is that nobody who meets Mr. Rowland thinks he is a fool, and that if he had known that everything he did would become public, many of the things that happened would not have happened, and many of the corners that were cut would not have been cut. I support the spirit of the clause—In deed, the spirit of the clause will be widely supported—but I object to the implication in the hon. Member's speech that there is an army of what he called "guzzling, Nero type entrepreneurs" moving round the highways and byways of British commerce having a damned good time at the expense of the British taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I happen to believe that there is a tiny minority who have behaved like that, and that throughout the country thousands of respectable businesses are being run by men who get on with their job of making a profit, creating jobs and creating substantial tax revenues which this Government, better than most, have a habit of wasting. On the basis of two instances, for him to utter a blanket condemnation of British business and British businessman is uncalled for and unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the hon. Member has established any case for a national audit service. Unlike him, I do not have any admiration for State monopoly. Our experience in the whole range has led us to believe that it has become clear that monopoly is dangerous, and the Government accept that it is in the private field.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0943">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>513</span>
Experience in recent years is that State monopoly power is just as dangerous as private monopoly power, and the miners and others have given dramatic examples of how a national State monopoly can be abused. I am not in favour of State monopoly. I do not like State steel industries, and the case for a State audit service is simply not made. Throughout the City and in towns all over the country There are people who do a first-class job of reporting on the affairs of companies where frauds and deceits are not taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Luton, West had stuck to the point of his new clause by saying that the position of auditors should be strengthened and that the auditor had a duty to look at companies and he must publish the information that came to him, he would have been doing a great service to British commerce, because I believe that that would reduce dramatically the already small number of frauds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I declare an interest, in that one of my former partners, was appointed an inspector under the Companies Act and looked into the affairs of a company which in that instance also reflected badly on the reputations of those who had been running it. I had had my reservations about this system of investigation, but I come to be more and more an admirer of it. Although do not believe that the present system is perfect, it produces very good results. Some reports, like the London and Counties and the Lonrho Report, reflect great credit on those who carried them out and show that they achieved the object they were set up to achieve. Before we discredit the system, we should reflect on the first-class job that it is capable of producing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there is much too much emphasis on tax avoidance and perks. Far too much time spent by people in finding ways of getting money without paying tax. This is not an interest or a hobby that is reserved for the Tiny Rowlands of this world. Only recently at the National Union of Mineworkers' Conference Mr. Joe Gormley, the President, made a strong speech in defence of the perk. He told his men "You might think that I have not been doing a very good job"—I am fairly paraphrasing his words—"because you have not been able to get salary increases to which you are entitled. However, I have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>514</span>
arranged millions of pounds of tax free benefits available to my members, and there are millions more in the pipeline. These tax free benefits have two great advantages. First, there is no tax to be paid on them and, secondly, at a time of inflation they keep their real value and do not go down in value as wages do". Mr. Gormely was telling us that taxes are now so high that a great deal of emphasis is being put by the Tiny Rowlands and the Joe Gormless of this world on trying to ensure that what is really income arrives in their hands tax free.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, it is absolutely obscene to link a leader of British society with this man, Mr. Rowland. Secondly, if the hon. Member wants to talk in this way about unlimited perks worth millions of pounds which Joe Gormley has acquired for his members, he has a duty to inform the Committee of the source of the perks. It seems to me that he is diverting attention from the present social contract and the agreement for the 4 per cent. increase or latterly the maximum £6 increase a week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is in order because of the words "beneficial, and so on," but this is not a discussion on that. The discussion is one the clause. I hope that the hon. Member will not go into a wide debate that is not relevant to the clause. There is nothing in the clause about State auditors. They are not part and parcel of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your ruling, Mr. Crawshaw. I referred to that case only because the lion. Member for Luton, West said that the case was emerging for a State audit service. The point I was trying to make was that the reason why powers such as these are necessary for the auditor is that there is now more and more emphasis by a whole range of people in society on trying to turn something that is really income into something that is not and is not taxable. Most of the things about which the hon. Member was complaining, and most of the reasons that he adduced for his new clause, stem from the fact that people were developing things that put into their hands money which was not regarded as income and which should have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0944">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>515</span>
been brought to the attention of the shareholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I was saying to the hon. Member was that Mr. Gormley was the man who made the speech from which I quoted. I am not saying that this is something that I think he should have said. I was saying that Mr. Gormley, in his own explanation to his own members about what he was doing on their behalf and why they should support the Social Contract, said that he had been able to obtain millions of pounds worth of benefits for them, and that the benefits have two great virtues—they are not liable to tax, and they retain their real value as the value of money goes down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a strange way Mr. Tiny Rowland and Hr. Joe Gormley were out to achieve roughly the same end, for two reasons. First, at a time of high inflation income and paper money cease to have much value. secondly, we have a tax system which hon. Members opposite bless all the time which makes it more and more worthwhile to concentrate on turning money into tax free income than to work Lard and earn more money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are serious problems which I think the new clause will help to resolve. 	<i>We</i> ought to feel that in legislating in this way that we are solving a problem. We are dealing with the results, the byproducts, the cause of which is something which requires a much more fundamental change. However, I shall not stray into the economic arguments because I should certainly be called to order if I were to do so. I welcome the new clause. I enjoyed listening to the hon. Gentleman as he moved it, and I shall certainly support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has soiled his case by the comments that he Las just made in trying to link a trade union negotiator, one of the best of our national leaders, with this firm's activity which has taken place in this decade behind drawn curtains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know the speech of Mr. Gormley to which the hon. Gentleman referred, and I am absolutely certain that Mr. Gormley Las never said that perks in any form whatsoever are a substitute for wages. He has never made that claim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to have to contradict the hon. Member. He should
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>516</span>
pop down to the Library and look at the paper or write to the NUM and get a copy of Mr. Gormley's speech. In his speech in which he was selling the Social Contract to his members said quite clearly that an offering on the side, a perk, or a tax free benefit was advantageous because it retained its value at a time of high inflation. I have in no way misrepresented Mr. Gormley.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that he was referring to the unacceptable facets of capitalism, and the tendency in modern society where, because of taxes and for other reasons, there is a drift into that area where people can improve their living standards by getting paid ill kind. I am certain that Joe Gormley was never saying that perks were a substitute for wages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case to which the hon. Gentleman referred was raised only because my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, West (Mr. Sedgemore) referred to Lonhro. That seemed to put him off a bit. The reference seemed to prevent him from supporting this new clause. This is the very essence of the whole business. Hon. Gentlemen opposite, with their professional understanding of the situation, have outlined the weaknesses of the present company law and the necessity for professionalism in terms of recognised audit. This is the crux of the new clause and of the statements made so far. The only relevance of this Bill is that it enables Members of Parliament to make some reference to the necessity for fresh audit methods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister himself has pointed to the weakness of the Bill and its absolute irrelevancy, in the sense that it does not apply to multi-nationals, and the anomalies that exist. There is no way in which the Department can be alerted to something that is wrong in a given company, if it is the intention of that company to hide it irregular practices. There is no way in which the Minister can be alerted. That is a great weakness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that there is a necessity to strengthen the powers of auditors. Wealthy Conservative Members opposite have a personal interest in this. It is a wealthy profession. Its members are far better off than lawyers. Anyone who wants to find the shortest distance between poverty and wealth should become a certified account-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0945">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

ant, and not remain a certified Member of Parliament. To become a certified accountant is the way to great riches in the country; all is laid out for them as a result of their profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard from the Minister a most devastating case against British capitalism and Lonhro and what I thought was brilliant support for the new clause. As I understand it, my hon. Friend advocates that we should support the new clause without reservation as a brilliant and necessary addition to the Bill. What we have listened to is not a treatise on the unacceptable face of capitalism, but a treatise on the masked face of capitalism. Presumably, those directors who sat round the table wore masks. This is not just unacceptable or obscene. It is the masked face of capitalism with which we have to contend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we shall unanimously support the new clause, and I derive some happiness from thinking that my brief appearance here has been of some value. I hope that in the next Session the Department will submit its ideas for its legislative programme and the Minister will contact his colleagues in the Department and tell them that we must think carefully about including matters of this sort in the programme. I hope that never again will a Labour Government start to select pieces of legislation of this sort merely to occupy itself and for no other reason. Unless that is the case now, there is no sense in the Minister asking for this new clause to be rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that my hon. Friend, instead of making remarks like that, had spent a little more time here instead of being somewhere else. We should have welcomed his interventions, which might have been a little more frequent, and he would have seen that the Bill is not irrelevant. It is a modest but important Bill in asserting the additional powers of the auditors. Unfortunately, my hon. Friend elected to play no part in debating the measure, and I regret that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend will know that there are powers of disclosure under present legislation which may have proved inadequate, and we have to consider what additional measures are necessary. We have commissioned a report on the problem of conflicts between directors' personal interests and their duty to the company. We are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>518</span>
hoping to receive that report soon. It is our intention to publish it as a consultative document which I hope my hon. Friend will read. The Department's draft consultative paper on the aims and scope of companies reports also recognises the need for additional disclosure on this subject, and invites comment on it. If I have been a little scathing to my hon. Friend, he will understand why. I do not regard it as a waste of time of the Committee to pursue this matter. Important changes will be reflected in what we have achieved so far and when the Bill becomes law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now refer to the independent supervisory authority. We must consult a wide body of interests. We must see how to regulate and supervise the securities market. I do not think that my hon. Friend is asking us to press his proposed new clause to a Division today. I gather that he proposes to withdraw it. He realises that we must consider the matter. It is only one of a number of proposals that are being considered by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened to what the hon. Member for Luton, West (Mr. Sedgemore) said on this question, which touches on the whole problem of disclosure. It is a serious question. His clause deserves serious attention, but if he decides that he wishes to vote for it I shall not support it. I should like to give my reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has not answered the question that I asked on the subject of disclosure. After disclosure—what? After disclosure what is to happen within the joint stock company when the facts come to light? I think that the object of company law reform, in strengthening the supervisory powers of the auditor and of the non-executive director, must be to promote the health of the organisation, not only in the interests of the shareholders or directors, but of the employees. If the provisions relating to disclosure simply create misunderstanding or a total breakdown of trust, that will not do any good. We must ensure that the company has ways of curing its problems, and that those ways are exercised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish that the hon. Gentleman had given a little more support to my efforts to see that law reform moves in the direction of the development of data and putting it to its proper use. I do not support this clause, as I think it would dc more harm than good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is sad that the hon. Member for Luton, West (Mr. Sedgemore) in moving the new clause—which a number of hon. Members feel has some virtues—did so in a manner which I think fell below the standards which we in the House of Commons normally expect. It is clear that he launched a personal attack without abiding by the normal conventions in these matters. It is also clear that he did so in Standing Committee, where those whom he attacked are not able to be present. He could have perhaps taken another opportunity downstairs where that situation would not have existed. Therefore, we must treat his remarks in that light. I feel that we must reject the wild generalisations made by the hon. Gentleman in seeking to raise broader political issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That having been said, I stress strongly that the concern of the Conservative Party is that the framework of company law should be such that abuses are prevented. I made that clear earlier today. I indicated on the Floor of the House that I believed that that was why the inquiry into Lonrho, to which he referred in such vivid terms, should be established. It is right that an inquiry should have been carried out so that we should be made aware of the facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are anxious to press for urgent action to remedy abuses which are shown to exist. We pressed for action on the question of warehousing, and we are glad that the Government have indicated that they intend to do something about it by accepting the new clauses that I moved earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in that responsible frame of mind that we should seek to establish a situation where those responsible—they are the bulk of people in industry and commerce—for generating the wealth of this country, on which all else depends, should be able to do so within the right environment. In that context I think that we should stress as powerfully as possible the point made by the Minister. He said that the number of examples of abuses form a tiny minority of the total where problems arise. We must emphasise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the clause. It is right that we should await the results of the Government's consultations and the proposals that they will put forward. It is also right to draw attention to the fact that there are already provisions—for example Section 199 of the 1948 Act—which are concerned
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>520</span>
with the disclosure by directors of interests in contracts. Therefore, the matter must be considered also in the context of existing legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inspectors' reports have aroused a great deal of interest in recent months. Those who are mentioned in reports may feel that there is some argument for commenting on the framework within which a report has been made. It would be wrong for the Government to assume that there is not legitimate and widespread concern about recent reports. I think that historically the reports have served a useful function. However, I am increasingly worried about the delay in making them. In recent months there were enquiries into V & G, London and County, and Lonrho. Only yesterday or the day before there was a report on Dwell Construction Limited and other associated companies. They are useful if produced quickly but if they are slow to appear they are useless, except as a historic record and a commentary on the need for changing the law. Sometimes we do not receive them for five or six years. It is important that they should be produced as rapidly as possible, consistent with their being reliably and properly researched.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Legitimate concern has been expressed about some of the procedures, especially where those who are being examined by the inspectors have no idea what other people being examined by the inspectors may have said. I intend to show that the present system has considerable virtues. It is right that we should consider whether there are ways in which it may be improved and whether, in view of the question of speed, hearings at which all the people involved know exactly what is being said deserve further examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that a problem is posed by the sheer bulk of the reports. Hon. Members may not yet have seen the report that was published a few days ago. I suggested at Question Time that it was perhaps unfortunate in the Lonrho case that not all the written evidence had apparently been included in the report. That is a problem that we must consider. The latest report on Dwell Construction Limited runs to four volumes, which are 9" or 10" thick, and costs £26.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that context, the points raised by the hon. Member for Luton, West were helpful. It would be right for us to concern ourselves with the study that the Govern-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0947">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>521</span>
ment are now undertaking. I assure the Government that the Opposition are in the forefront of those who believe that it is important that the system that we operate has a proper framework of law in which abuses are prevented. Therefore, I reject the insinuations which the hon. Gentleman sought to make about my hon. Friends and myself. However, that is not our anxiety. Our anxiety is that those on the extreme Left wish to try to use the very few cases where abuses occur as a means of dealing with the matter so as to receive maximum publicity. That creates a false impression. It is damaging to the interests of business and the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we should have a balanced approach to these matters. In that context, it is unfortunate that in moving a new clause which raised a number of important issues—although it is subject to the inquiry being carried out by the Government—it was not put forward in the spirit that is necessary if we are to improve company law. That law must be improved as rapidly as possible. It would be unfortunate if there were un- necessary procrastination. That is one reason why in this Committee I have con- sistently pressed the Government to take action rapidly, consistent with adequate consultation, and why I hope that they will give us an assurance before this Committee stage has finished that in addition to the legislation on the Bullock Report they will include in that legislation the other major changes in company law that are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be unfortunate if the Department of Trade were to fail to persuade the Leader of the House about the need for fundamental legislation and these matters were left on one side and replaced with other measures of a kind which the Opposition regard as irrelevant, or measures which the hon. Member for Luton, West would favour. The hon. Gentleman must get his priorities sorted out. I hope that we may persuade him that what is needed in this case are not further measures of nationalisation, which are totally irrelevant to the problems of this country, but a correct framework of law in which those who generate wealth in this country may get on with the job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

structive debate. Even the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) made a constructive speech. I did not agree with all of it, but I was interested in what he said. I know that he does not mean to gag this Committee. He will realise that that would be undemocratic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South (Mr. Parkinson) made a constructive speech. He was deliberately slightly mischievous and malevolent about Joe Gormley. Nevertheless, we listened with great interest, safe in the knowledge that there are two hon. Members battling deep in the heart of the Conservative Party to change the Conservative ethos.

In view of the hour, I think that I should consider the interests of the Committee and those who serve it.

	<div class='title'>Financial interests of auditors</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>'(1) An auditor of any company shall not have any financial interest in the affairs of that company.</p>
	<p>(2) A person in breach of the provisions of subsection (1) above shall be guilty of an offence and liable—
	<ol>
	<li>on conviction on indictment, to a fine; or</li>
	<li>on summary conviction, to a fine not not exceeding £400'.—(	<i>Mr. Loveridge.</i>)</li></ol></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This relates to an important omission in the law. I was surprised to find that omission. The new clause aims to ensure that an auditor of any company shall not have any financial interest in the affairs of that company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter came to my attention when I read a letter in 	<i>The Times</i> of 26th July from Professor Edward Stamp, Director of the International Centre for Research in Accounting, University of Lancaster. He said:
	<br><q><p>"…auditors must be like Caesar's wife. The rule must be immaculate, placing auditors above the possibility of suspicion".</p></q>
He went on to say:
	<br><q><p>"…the rules introduced last year by the English institute are not good enough because they do not prohibit the auditors of public companies from holding a financial interest in their clients".</p></q>
That also applies to private or non-public companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this country there is not even a requirement for the auditor to disclose the amount of his holding or its value. I contrast that with the situation in Canada, where the Corporations Act makes the holding of shares, or a stake in the equity of a company, illegal. In the United States, the larger firms are prohibited by the rules of the Security Exchange Commission from holding shares in their clients' firms, for firms with stock exchange dealings and for any other firms with over $300,000 of debentures outstanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further examples show that the rules of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants prohibit such holdings under Rule 101 of its code of ethics. Those tight rules help to ensure the probity of the auditors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that with the co-operation of the Committee it may
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>524</span>
be possible to finish the Bill by 1.15 p.m. In those circumstances, I use my powers to extend the Sitting to 1.15 p.m.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Crawshaw.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In contrast, in this country the Institute of Chartered Accountants, which last year instituted a voluntary scheme, has no firm rule for disinvestment. It is not enough for auditors to be prohibited from being directors of clients' firms. The auditor should be prohibited from owning the client firm or a portion of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are four good reasons why this clause should be added to the Bill. First, we are strengthening the power of the auditors under the Bill. At the same time we should strengthen the law to ensure their probity. In the case of large firms, the temptation of auditors who have considerable shareholdings in the firms whose accounts they audit to deal improperly on the market is obvious. Anything less than legal control makes a mockery of the idea of the auditors' independence. I am especially concerned with small firms. It is easy to envisage circumstances where, on the death of one director, an anguished family is helped by an auditor who offers to take up their shares. That might properly be done and be helpful to the family involved, but surely the auditor should not audit the accounts as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider the interests of the professional bodies. These highly respected institutions—members of which serve on our Committee—deserve protection from the black sheep in their midst. I should like to quote a letter from a Mr. Coates of Price Waterhouse in response to an earlier exchange of letters in 	<i>The Times.</i> On 17th July he said:
	<br><q><p>"In my view it would be wrong to draw the conclusion that accountancy firms in this country are universally lax in maintaining strict financial independence in relation to their clients.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>My experience is that most firms with large audit practices do require their partners and staff to be independent of their clients.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>My own firm's rules are i nall respects as stringent as, and in some respects more so than, those which apply in Canada and the United States."</p></q>
He continues:
	<br><q><p>"I agree with Professor Stamp that three is a need for rules on independence."</p></q>
However, I note from talking to Professor Stamp this week, that his research shows that only a small number of Unit
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0949">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>525</span>
Kingdom firms have tight rules in any form or sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is necessary for the professional integrity of our auditors that these rules should be brought into law. I hope the Minister will feel that there is a need for legislation in this connection even if he cannot accept the precise form of the new clause. This would require an extension before Report by the Government, to cover any transitional period that might be required to allow those auditors who have holdings in their firms to divest themselves of those holdings or arrange for alternative auditors to take over. The independence of auditors is of the greatest importance and I hope that the Committee will find merit in the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much as I should like to support my hon. Friend, this new clause is far too wide. Does the phrase
	<br><q><p>" … shall not have my financial interest in the affairs of the company"</p></q>
means that if a company wants advice in any capacity other than auditing, that person should have a financial interest? Does that mean that if one happens to audit in a firm which supplies the firm in question, one has a financial interest? "Any financial interest" is a wide and ill-defined phrase. I hope that the Minister will resist the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am wondering why hon. Members do not wish to continue this important Committee sitting. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not withdraw his clause. I shall support it. I want to vote for it. The question of the independence of auditors is so important to the whole of company law that it is essential that we should talk about it. I suggest than when we start to put together the Companies (No. 3) Bill this should be dealt with then and included in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that when we come to such a Bill my hon. Friend will put in an occasional appearance. The law already provides for certain requirements regarding the independence of auditors. While I recognise that we have to consider this matter, we also must attach some significance to professional standards im-

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an abuse of parliamentary time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—which carry a draconian penalty, namely expulsion from the profession or extinction of the possibility of receiving his previous earnings as an auditor. I shall look at the position, but this is not the right time or place to do it. As far as I know, where auditors in the past have had shareholdings in clients' companies, this has not given rise to any significant problems. It is a potential abuse in theory, but in practice it does not seem to have led to many complaints. Much greater risks to the independence of auditors arise from two causes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is that an auditor who has been associated with a company for a long time and knows its officers could well tend to take things for granted. That may have happened in the Lonrho situation. This is one of the possibilities—the fact that the auditor did not always check on statements made by those whom he regarded as friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second danger is that a small firm of auditors may be dependent on one or two large accounts and will have no incentive to cause trouble. Those are the more dangerous situations than the one</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think there is a need for the Government to look at this matter very closely. I recognise that the new Clause is worded very broadly indeed, and perhaps too broadly for any Government to accept; none the less, I feel that there is a very grave need for the Government to look at this issue more closely—especially at the practice in Canada—and I hope the Minister will consider it before Report stage.
