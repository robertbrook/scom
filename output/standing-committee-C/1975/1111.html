	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Concerning the Sittings Motion moved by the Minister, I am sure that Opposition hon. Members see no objection to the arrangement proposed. However, at this stage of our deliberations it would be helpful if the Government told us their intentions. When I last appeared as a speaking member, if I may put it like that, of a Committee dealing with an Agriculture Bill, I remember getting into some difficulty with my Front Bench by saying that these Agriculture Bills, which have a habit of going to Committee at this time of year, were annual jamborees that lasted from muck-spreading to seed-time. I hope that our deliberations on this Bill will not last too long. There is not as much in this Bill as in past Agriculture Bills which lasted through many sittings.

The main factor governing the length of Committee time needed, however, depends on the Government's attitude to various amendments that might be put down. One amendment, tabled in the name of the hon. Member for Durham (Mr. Hughes) and supported by other Labour Members, proposes alterations to the landlord and tenant law, by seeking to amend the provisions of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government may feel that the Bill is a good and suitable vehicle for amending the Agricultural Holdings Act. I suggest that at this early stage it is important for us to know the Government's intentions. If over the next few weeks we are to have odd amendments or new clauses appearing on the Amendment Paper which will cause major changes in, say, the landlord and tenant law, I submit that we should know now. During this past week I know that a number of representations
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
have been made to us concerning other potential amendments or new clauses seeking to alter this sector of the law. If we are to use the Bill as a vehicle for amending this section of the law, a great many amendments will doubtless be tabled by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that one of my hon. Friends is already aware of 20 such amendments. I am bound to say that I do not think that this would be a particularly fruitful or sensible exercise. if the Government embark on an exercise that will lead to many discussions about changing the form of the law in relation to landlord and tenant, then there ought to be a great deal of consultation and thought between the Government and interested parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that hon. Members opposite take a particular view over the matter on which there is a new clause on the Amendment Paper. Their new clause is in a form which would not be acceptable to the National Farmers' Union which started off this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hereditary privilege!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) makes a comment and no doubt may wish to say something in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we must embark on this exercise, it should not be done by amendments appearing from the Government back benches, from the Opposition back benches, or even from the back benches on both sides. It would be more sensible if, in view of the situation and in view of the ideas already in the heads of people outside this House, the Government told us their ideas for changing the law in relation to landlord and tenant. It is important that the Government tell us today their attitude to these matters. It would be best if the Government were to say that, apart from the four clauses which are already in the Bill which deal with harassment of tenants, they will resist any other changes to the landlord and tenant law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not entering into the merits of Government back bench amendments or into the merits of any other amendments that may be tabled. But it would be a foolish and fruitless exercise if we were to try to amend a major part of the law

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
affecting the agricultural industry without wider consultation and preparation. I fear that, unless the Government are prepared to give an undertaking at this stage, the Bill might develop in this way, and we may find ourselves sitting for a great many more mornings in the weeks to come than would seem likely on this first morning of our consideration of this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One knows the customary method of opening these Committees when general skirmishing takes place on the Sittings Motion. Like a game of chess, it is a pawn in advance, and it sometimes returns to its original position. There has been a difference in this case, however. I cannot recall a case ever being made in a debate on a Sittings Motion, seeking a comment or reply on amendments placed on the Amendment Paper before the Committee actually sat. It is a highly improper request for the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) to make of the Minister presenting a Sittings Motion, pre-empting, as it does, the rights of the Committee to discuss any question on the Amendment Paper, or to make any such decision when the point is reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only highly improper that the hon. Member has put it forward in this way, but it would be highly improper for the Minister to give an answer before the case had been deployed. For all I know, the Minister will wish to deploy the case for this amendment. It is not unusual or unknown for back bench amendments to be tabled with the full backing of the Government. It is not unknown, especially to the Opposition party, which one recalls once found a highly organised system of putting down Parliamentary Questions to be answered by the Minister. Therefore, it seems highly improper to do all of these things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member raised the question of taking from muck spreading to seed time. I do not know which seed he had in mind, but it sounded remarkably like rape. There are problems about the definition of rape. If there is a belief in the willing complicity of the partner, rape is no longer held to be an offence. In this case, for all we know there is a willingness on the part of the Government. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman's argument again would not hold water. Behind this attempt to rape from the Amendment
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
Paper an amendment which has been rightly put down there is an unacceptable motive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have known the hon. Gentleman for many years, and a nice gentle chap he is. But behind the gentleness there were certain teeth being shown. The teeth, of course, are the extraordinary proposition that, unless the Minister gives an answer on the amendment before it is due to be discussed, the Opposition will put down a whole series of amendments in order to prolong the time of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is very serious. This is a threat to the rights of the Committee and to the House of Commons. I have never before heard the proposition advanced that a decision must be made in advance of discussion. If that decision is given before the discussion, it is not only a denial of the right to reply; it is also a denial of free speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope the hon. Gentleman is not criticising the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make clear that at the beginning of any Committee such discussion is in order. The Sittings Motion gives a general idea of what is happening. The hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) made only a fleeting reference to it. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will follow the same policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. Costain. Could I say perish the thought straight away. I had no thought of criticising the Chair. I thought the hon. Gentleman was absolutely in order in a discussion on a Sittings Motion. He was not out of technical order but suffering from a state of impropriety in suggesting that this is the way that the House of Commons should conduct its affairs. It seems to me, if not unparliamentary in the technical sense, certainly a highly improper method of proceeding that the hon. Gentleman should demand a rejection—this is what he is asking—not a reply, not an answer or a commitment, but one answer, namely, a rejection before a case has been put. If the rejection on the question relating to the clause on security of tenure is not made, the Opposition will put down
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
a number of unstated amendments, not dealing with the security of tenure of tenant farmers but on other topics. 	<i>[Hon. Members:"</i> How does the hon. Member know?] That is what is known as an intelligent guess.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument was that we should not bring in a measure of this dimension by amendment in the middle of a Committee. With respect, that is precisely what happened the last time that there was a discussion on the proposition of security of tenure. It was brought in as an amendment in the middle of a Committee stage on security of inheritance for the tenant farmer in Scotland. Not only was it brought in during the middle of a Committee stage but—since it was I who proposed it and the Committee was convinced by my argument—it was in fact carried among those who voted for the measure on exactly the same lines as this clause. Indeed, it was brought in later because it was not on the Notice Paper when the Committee started.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, if there were any merit at all in the hon. Member's argument, which in view of what happened there is not, it would be of less merit on that occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it went through the Committee. No such arguments were deployed and among those who supported it was the present Minister of Agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How far can we go in demanding that a Minister of State answers on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, who has himself voted for precisely this proposition in relation to one part of the United Kingdom? One may be all for devolution, but it is somewhat monstrous to allow one section of the community to profit from this measure, in the way proposed here, but not to allow other parts of the United Kingdom to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister of State will not succumb to these veiled threats, this kind of Loch Ness monster that we have seen appearing from the other side—this time wasting, this muck spreading disease. The hon. Gentleman is threatening to prolong the sitting right into the grain harvest. If there is any time wasting, it will not be by the Government side. We promise that when we come to this clause we shall make short speeches and have the measure passed within the day with no problems. We shall not waste time. We shall get the measure through in one
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
sitting if necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, it is not alien to the rest of the Bill. It is not true to say that this is a new major item being introduced. In fact, the question of tenant farmers is already dealt with in the clauses on harassment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Member is not going to start on the merits of amendments. We are discussing the general policy and how we can get on in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to help the Committee. Far from departing from the general discussion, my argument is exactly in line with it, as there are already clauses regarding the tenant farmer in relation to harassment. For that reason, it is appropriate that the clause should be part of the Bill, and I hope that the Minister of State will resist not only the threats but the blandishments, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) is trailing his coat far too far out. There is no question of threat. We are talking about time now. We have to discuss whether we are to discuss on Tuesdays and Thursdays or only one day of the week. This is extremely important in view of what the Parliamentary Secretary said in relation to the new clause, because on Second Reading he spoke of the need for consultations with the National Farmers' Union and the Country Landowners' Association, and one must assume that, having begun, those consultations must continue. Indeed, the NFU and the CLA must arm themselves with sensible explanations for the Minister. They must marshal their facts and themselves confer with many people up and down the country, and this will take time. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree—if not, I am sure the Minister himself would agree—that it may be several months before those consultations are complete.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, therefore, wrong to expect the Government to form a judgment about this new clause until those consultations are complete. That is why it is important that we know now whether we shall have sufficient time meaningfully to discuss the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0014">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
new clause at the appropriate time, which one hopes will be long before seed time. But it will not be appropriate to speed up the Committee sittings in such a way as to reach that new clause in, say, January or February, if the consultations are not completed. Therefore, it may be more appropriate for the Committee to meet just one day a week, perhaps just on Tuesdays, in order to give the Minister the time that he obviously needs to carry out his consultations. It goes without saying that if we are to sit two days a week we shall make double progress and the Minister would have half the amount of time available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps, therefore, the Minister could give some indication as to what progress he has made. He undertook on Second Reading that these consultations would take place, and, having done so, he said:
	<br><q><p>we would carefully consider any new clause introduced in Committee."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st December 1975; Vol. 901, c. 1352.]</p></q>
Will the Minister say now whether he has had these consultations and whether that consideration has now carefully taken place? Will he now say whether he needs to consider it any more? Can he not give us an indication as to whether he will have to accept the new clause, or whether it will be necessary for these consultations to take place over a prolonged period?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to take the matter a little further. With regard to the actual days mentioned in the Sittings Motion, I hope that it may be possible between the Front Benches to decide that we do not, in fact, sit next Thursday morning; but that, perhaps, is another matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the matter which my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) has raised, I think it very proper and sensible—from the Government's point of view, too—to raise this at the beginning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was on the Committee which considered the last Miscellaneous Provisions Bill and have, I believe, been on four or five of them. They seem to come thick and fast like leaves in the autumn. I remember the occasion when this clause was introduced in regard to Scotland. I believe that everybody felt it was a wrong way in which to introduce it into the Bill. It was introduced by the Government but, if I remember rightly, it was then said that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
there was a special case for Scotland because the law had been bad some years ago. I may be wrong about this, but I have a feeling that this was said, amongst other things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But as someone who has been an arbitrator and acted on both sides in an arbitration, I am only saying that the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is not the appropriate place to change the whole Agricultural Holdings Act, by a piecemeal attack on a part of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my opinion, for the past 15 years this Act has wanted to be overhauled, but it needs a major piece of legislation to be able to do it. Many matters want introducing and it would take far longer than having sittings on Tuesdays and Thursdays for the next nine months to effect all the alterations. The Agricultural Holdings Act should be altered to meet the case of the modern systems and requirements of farming and to bring up to date the landlord and tenant provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I hope that the Minister will set our minds at rest, because it is causing many bodies throughout the country a considerable amount of work and inconvenience to have the thing thrown in in this way from a back bench Member without the Government expressing a view about it one way or the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caerwyn Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support my hon. Friend the Member for Renfewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) in his request to the Minister not to be tempted into the trap that has been laid for him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members opposite have not produced a very good atmosphere in which to start the Committee proceedings by issuing threats. It was nothing other than a threat to tell the Minister that, unless he does this, they will do the other. It was a blatant threat and it would be just as well, if they wish the Minister to give his view, for them to come clean and give their views on the amendment. It is not that they want further consultations so much as they want the proposal scrapped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

They could be abusing the purposes of the Committee if they were to say that we could not go ahead and discuss any matter relating to agriculture

provisions. This is a Miscellaneous Provisions Bill and hon. Members say that we should not interfere or bring in new material on the landlord and tenant relationships, but it is already in the Bill in Clauses 11 and 12. We are interfering with the landlord and tenant relationship. Without going into the merits of the amendment, we are asking that we should further discuss the landlord and tenant relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members opposite talk of further consultations. It is my view that consultations have been taking place for many years, ever since the Scottish provisions were recommended. I have had consultations with many people, as I am sure the Minister has. We feel it would sharpen those consultations if the proposed new clause were to remain in the Bill. It would ensure that urgency was brought to this matter so that the Ministry would consult. On Second Reading my hon. Friend said that he would need time to consult. He has that time because I believe we will not be discussing this amendment until the new year. By then, sufficient time will have been allowed for talking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg my hon. Friend to keep an open mind in this matter. We need to discuss it in Committee, and put that request to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope it will help the Committee if I point out that, whatever the Minister says, or whatever the Opposition threaten, it will be my job as Chairman to select such amendments as are in order in accordance with the Title of the Bill. It will be for the Committee to decide whether it accepts them. I hope too much will not be made of trying to debate a new clause which we will not reach for several weeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. E. S. Bishop)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) has made the opening speech for the Opposition. I noticed with some reluctance that there was a suggestion of discord—I put it no higher than that—on the future of this measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that on Second Reading we had a fairly wide-ranging discussion of the merits of the Bill and about what should or should not be included in it. Following my moving of the Sittings Motion, the hon. Gentleman was right to ask how long the Bill is likely to be in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
I have moved the motion suggesting that we meet on Tuesday and Thursday mornings. If anyone suggests that we should meet only one day a week—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or five days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or five days a week, as my hon. Friend suggests. We should all bear in mind that we want this measure as soon as is reasonably possible. Of course, there should not be undue haste to pass the Bill without proper consideration. I am sure that the Opposition as well as my hon. Friends will ensure that. On the other hand, we do not wish unduly to prolong the proceedings, because I think the Bill has been generally welcomed by the industry. The producers, the distributors, the trade unions and the workers generally have welcomed the Bill, because such Bills are presented only too rarely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall that the Committee Stage of the last Bill on which I was a member had 14 sittings. I think the Bill was worth it for all that, but I hope this Committee does not last as long. However, we want to do justice to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that on Second Reading the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) called the Bill:
	<br><q><p>…a poor thing…more concerned with bureaucracy than with altering trends of production or the prosperity of the countryside."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st December 1975; Vol. 901, c. 1284.]</p></q>
He might have been a little more welcoming this morning of anything which made the Bill better than "a poor thing" and made it useful. The Government think the Bill is useful. It will produce a very welcome Act of Parliament which is needed by the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a situation where we are living in an age of violence, certainly of belligerency, I suspect that some of my hon. Friends were a little unkind to the hon. Gentleman in suggesting that he was issuing threats. I can appreciate that the hon. Member wishes to have co-operation in this matter, but at the same time he is starting to debate a measure on a Sittings Motion. If he takes issue with something which is already on the Notice Paper, or which may be on the Notice Paper because of the views of the Government on this matter, he is rather suggesting that the Bill should not be changed because of this particular measure he has in mind, which is concerned with what I think
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0016">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
everybody would agree is an important aspect of landlord-tenant relations. The hon. Gentleman appears to hope that we shall not take steps to change the Agricultural Holdings Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the hon. Gentleman to the winding-up speech made by my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary a week ago. My hon. Friend mentioned a number of questions raised in the debate in the House expressing concern about the situation which arises on the death of the tenant of a farm in England or Wales. My hon. Friend commented that the question raised a number of issues and that the NFU had come out strongly in favour of the change. He quoted the NFU brief, which said:
	<br><q><p>"It is, however, regretted that the Government has not—so far at any rate—taken the opportunity of including in this Bill provisions to afford to the sons and near relatives of tenant farmers in England and Wales a comparable right to that already existing in Scotland to seek to succeed to the tenancy on the death of the tenant."</p></q>
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the National Farmers' Union view. Opposition hon. Members often point out, rightly, the importance of the NFU in agriculture and food production affairs. I should have thought that the hon. Member was somewhat hasty to suggest only a few days later that the Government should have taken a decision on the matter and that we should have said that we did not agree with the NFU.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote again from my hon. Friend's winding-up speech on 1st December:
	<br><q><p>"We have been having consultations with the CLA, the NFU and other interested organisations, such as the RICS. My right hon. Friend is giving careful consideration to the issue."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st December 1975; Vol. 901, c. 1351.]</p></q>
The Government said that on 1st December, which is only 10 days ago including the weekend, when consideration may not have been continuing. The Government have been consulting all the interests concerned. We cannot ignore, or throw overboard without recognition of its importance, what the NFU as well as the CLA said on the matter. Therefore, I can only tell the hon. Member, now that the matter of family succession—and possibly other matters, too—has been raised on Second Reading and today, that careful consideration is being given to the issue. I suggest that the hon. Member's comment was somewhat hasty if, after all
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
the consultations and the pressure brought to bear on us up to and beyond Second Reading, he expects me to stand here and say that they came to nothing and that the Government have decided not to do anything about it. That is not the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be irresponsible for me to say that all that information does not count, and that the Government have taken a decision not to do anything about the issue. Hon. Members may say that another Bill would be the answer. That view has been expressed. We must consider the possibilities of bringing legislation before Parliament, and the question whether the Bill may not be the vehicle, as it has been for a number of important issues, to deal with this particular subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reiterate my remark that the Government are still considering the situation and have not taken any view. When we have taken a view in the light of the consultations held, we shall come to a decision. Further discussion may then be necessary with the interests involved before we finalise our position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) is not relevant to the Sittings Motion? Although the NFU might agree with the proposal contained in the amendment which we have vaguely discussed this morning, surely many other organisations may not agree with it. If the Government are seemingly so sympathetic to the proposal, why was it not included in the Bill? It will inevitably change the whole direction of our Committee debates if such a major departure from the original Bill is envisaged. We shall need a much longer time to debate the issue than we shall for discussion on the Bill as d rafted</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I were to respond to the hon. Member's invitation to say whether I thought the discussion of the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) was relevant to the Sittings Motion, I should be pre-empting your job, Mr. Costain. I should not wish to take on that responsibility on top of the duty I have already. The fact that you, Mr. Costain, have allowed this discussion indicates that you think it relevant to this sitting. I certainly do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0017">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
What is perhaps deplorable—perhaps that word is a little strong—but what is regrettable is the undertone implying that, if the Government do not keep to the Bill as it stands—a Bill which the hon. Member referred to as being "a poor thing" in effect—certain steps will be taken by him and his hon. Friends to delay the measure. I hope that that does not happen and that the debates can go forward in a constructive and practical way for the benefit of the industry as a whole and the food consumers of this country, with the intention of getting the measure on to the statute book as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot give a pledge that the Government will keep, on every issue, to a stated viewpoint. After all, we want to hear the views of hon. Members opposite and we may, as a result of their observations, put in a constructive and practical way, wish to bring in certain changes to the Bill. I am sure that the Opposition would not wish that we should not do that. I think that they would be delighted if we were to listen to their views and introduce certain changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is making a most helpful and placatory contribution. I have no complaints whatsoever about the contributions of the hon. Members for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) and for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick). They made valid points. Indeed, as it stands on the Notice Paper, presumably, as far at goes, the issue is in order. I have no desire now to debate any merits or whatever of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there are two practical points of procedure which underlay the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) and I think that the Minister is bound to address himself to them. First, if the Government are going to take this amendment with the utmost seriousness—I underline "utmost seriousness"—that situation would inevitably precipitate—and this is not at all a threat; it is the nature of the situation—a whole series of both consequential and separate amendments to the basic 1948 Act. This is the first practical point to which we must address ourselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Arising out of that is the second point, which breaks down into two parts. First, in such a situation, not merely for members of the Committee and the House but for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
members of the outside world who have cause to address themselves, perhaps with no purpose in the events, to all aspects of the 1948 Act, there is a very real possibility that we should be exposing ourselves to a Guillotine Motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fact, if we do arrive at the point of amendments in fundamental form to the 1948 Act, it will considerably delay the passage of what otherwise is, in all regards—subject to whatever underlining, dotting of i's or crossing of t's one may have in mind—an admirable and much welcome measure. But, if we step beyond that point, we could get into a very difficult area. I say to the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West, without in any way seeking to undermine his position, that we could get into a very difficult and protracted area, and I personally am very frightened of the possibility of the guillotine being applied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for his helpful remarks. I should not like to anticipate the guillotine, though we shall seek to execute our business with all due speed, consonant with doing a good job. But I think that the hon. Member was right to say that there could be many other consequential changes of legislation if we sought to make changes in the area we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not discussing the merits of the landlord and tenant relationships at this time. It would be impossible for me to do so. What I am discussing is the attitude of the hon. Gentleman opposite, which I do not see as a threat but as a kindly warning that, if we were to try to insert things of which he disapproved—I gather that this was one of them—there would be certain difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not necessarily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to be conciliatory between my hon. Friend and the hon. Member opposite. All I am saying is that I should not like us to be under any illusions that unless we gave promises this morning which the hon. Member would accept, the consequences would be, not perhaps delaying tactics, but actions on the part of his hon. Friends that would delay the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All hon. Members have a right to table amendments which are practical and concerned with this important subject. We ought also to consider, in relation to the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
scarcity of Miscellaneous Provisions legislation, whether this is the time to consider this or any other aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reiterate the promise made to the House only a week ago by my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary:
	<br><q><p>"My right hon. Friend is giving careful consideration to the issue."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st December 1975; Vol. 901, c. 1351.]</p></q>
I hope that we shall be able to come to a conclusion on the matter in the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore appeal for the co-operation of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, and I hope that the motion that we sit on Tuesdays and Thursdays will be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It had not been my intention to declare this particular interest so early in the proceedings, but, in view of the tenor of the debate, I think it would be right for me to inform the Committee that I am a tenant farmer and have been for about 16 years. I hope that I shall not have constantly to repeat that during the Committee proceedings and that the Committee will accept that as a once-andfor-all declaration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen might consider that this ludicrous business of continually declaring an interest might be done away with, in view of the perfectly well-established published document setting out such interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if it was necessary for the hon. Gentleman to declare his interest, because the only interest he should declare in relation to this matter is whether he has grandchildren.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my eldest son is only nine, although he is a man of considerable capacity, it is early days for grandchildren in my family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he was disturbed that in his opening remarks my hon. Friend had not been more welcoming to the Bill. I suspect that his welcome would have been perhaps warmer if he had seen the smiling face of the Minister's right hon. Friend. I appreciate that the right hon. Gentleman cannot be expected to attend all the proceedings of a Miscellaneous Provisions Bill Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in view of things that were said on Second Reading, perhaps he could have taken the trouble to come for a short
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
Time to deal with what he knew in advance would be a matter of principle which would be raised with him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee for not having said right at the start that my right hon. Friend was at a Cabinet meeting this morning and obviously could not attend the Committee, although he had every intention of being present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We understand the pressures under which the right hon. Gentleman has to operate and certainly in the present state of the nation it is important that he should at least be in the Cabinet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand the matter from all the bodies the Opposition have consulted, the Bill has come rather earlier than Whitehall had led the organisations concerned to believe. Three separate organisations have made it clear that, although they were aware through the normal channels of the progress of this legislation, it had gone higher up the list of proposed legislation than had originally been intended. I appreciate that in the non-controversial nature of the majority of the Bill, that is not an unreasonable thing to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I should like to make a separate point which has not been made concerning Clause 3. Clause 3 deals with the Meat and Livestock Commission. It has been represented to me that the month before Christmas is the busiest period in the meat trade. Many people engaged in the industry who would like to make representations, will be working flat out at their business. When considering whether we sit next week and so on, the Minister may take care to take that into account, because it has been put to me that this is causing difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) has totally misread the intentions behind my hon. Friend's remarks. The landlord and tenant legislation is extraordinarily complex and has grown up, not from one piece of legislation, but from several. Furthermore, there is substantial history of case work attached to this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not wish to delay this Bill. We are entirely agreed on the relatively innocuous nature of the proposals but if we must review a major item of landlord
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
and tenant legislation in this Bill, in the interests of justice for both parties—and there are some aspects of this legislation that are equally unfair to tenants and landlords—the Government ought to table major amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such amendments should not be a back bench operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a travesty of the truth for the Minister to say that he has been having consultations with all interested parties. It is true that for years there have been interchanges and discussions, but I do not understand it to have been put out by anybody from the Ministry that it was the intention of the Government to legislate on the landlord and tenant rules except on the two harassment clauses and their variations for Scotland. Any idea that the Government would smile upon the proposed change has not been propounded by the hon. Gentleman's officials. We take the view that the harassment clauses are by far from the most important alterations that ought to take place. There are 20 or 30 items which, in the interests of justice and the administration of this legislation, should have priority and would have it in the eyes of the lawyers who administer this law from day to day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government produced a White Paper, "Food From Our Own Resources", and promised every assistance to the agricultural community in carrying out the intentions of that White Paper. It would be totally irrelevant at this time—and without a much more formal approach—to try to re-write the whole of our agricultural land tenure legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend suggested a Select Committee, but I believe it would be necessary for a White Paper, or at least a Green Paper, to be produced—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not make this a Second Reading debate. We are discussing the occasions when we should sit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. Costain, I take your point. This is vitally important, however, and not just to us in this Committee, because our words go well outside this room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure you will appreciate that the CLA, the NFU, the Agricultural Lawyers' Association and many other organisations will be thrown into great confusion by the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
Minister's reply. They will have to drop everything and apply themselves to suggesting and helping the Opposition with Amendments, or better still, putting work into the amendments which the Government might table. If we must tinker with the landlord and tenant legislation beyond the clauses in the Bill, we should go much further. This is not a threat but a fact, which unhappily, would delay the progress of this Committee. I do not want this Committee to sit into March, April and May. I do not want us to have to debate a guillotine motion. That is the last thing in the world we, on the Conservative side of the Committee, want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Labour Members will take this as a genuine expression of our feelings. There are many things, in an Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, that we could do to delay progress if that was our intention. But it is not delay, but justice that we seek.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel, after what the Minister of State has said, that this puts us in a difficult position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raised it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will no doubt ask me to give way if he should want to make another speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister of State replied he seemed to have a better understanding of the points that we on this side have been trying to make than did his hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan). I have to repeat that, although the Minister said that he wants to get the Bill as soon as is reasonably possible, we have no inclination to oppose that ideal. Certainly, we on this side have no intention of prolonging the Bill, but important matters have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must take up the Minister on one point. He hinted that I should welcome further provisions, as I called the Bill " a poor thing " on Second Reading. He should realise that we have far too much legislation in the House and I regard less legislation as a better thing than more legislation. I feel that the House should be asked to consider new legislation only when it is absolutely essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) said,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0020">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
we want to get on with this matter. But we have been placed in a difficult position. I recommend to my hon. Friends not to oppose the Sittings Motion. Opposition to the motion would, perhaps, give a wrong impression and I want to emphasise that my remarks, and those of my hon. Friends, were intended to be helpful and to discover, for our own purposes, the Government's attitude. I tried hard this morning not to get involved in the merits of the new clause or the merits of other matters which might be raised, as I felt that it would be the wrong moment to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would certainly be prepared to consider all sorts of amendments on their merits at the right time, but I have made my point that this is a dangerous and unsatisfactory way of proceeding. If we are going to proceed in this way, in one way, over the new clause, I can see no objection to continuing to discuss other related matters as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend turned his attention to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) on Clause 3 and the MLC. As he pointed out, this is a busy time of the year for people in the meat trade and they obviously want to make representations to us, to ensure that this legislation is as good as possible. Too often, I believe, the House goes ahead in promoting legislation in ignorance of the genuine interests of those who will be affected by this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my hon. Friend request the Minister of State to make some comment about this? It has relevance to the point made by my hon. Friend for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins), who said that perhaps it would be inopportune and unnecessary for us to sit next Thursday, which is so close to Christmas, when those whose interests we will no doubt be debating next week will have been unable to make sufficient representations to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what my hon. Friend has said. The Minister of State will have heard his point and the similar point put by my hon, Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) a few moments earlier, so perhaps he will consider it. Those matters arise on Clause 3 and, as one who has been involved in the past with the usual channels, no
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
doubt that can be discussed through the usual channels. But if the Minister has something to tell us at this stage, it would be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong for us to vote against the Sittings Motion now. It would perhaps express a feeling which I have no intention of giving the impression exists on the Conservative side of the Committee. However, I ask the Minister of State, in view of this position, whether he can give us an undertaking that he will make a definitive statement on these matters as soon as possible. That would be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not say that in any way to decry the stature of the Minister of State and I hope he accepts it in that spirit. If the Minister could deal with this soon it would be helpful. I know that there is a difficulty next week because he will be in Brussels on Tuesday. If he has to go there to negotiate on behalf of the Government, we would not wish to take actions which prevented him from doing that important job. However, there will be a further opportunity, and if we could have an undertaking from the Minister of State that he will further explain this matter after due consideration it would be helpful. We could then proceed with Clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman wishes my right hon. Friend to be here. However, I would remind him that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary and I have all the authority of the Minister in what we say. Therefore, recognising the demands on the Minister and his responsibilities, sometimes in other places at the same time—which I am sure the Committee accepts—I do not think that we need wait for the Minister—although he is anxious to be here as often as possible. This matter can be resolved by the observations of myself or my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of landlord and tenancy succession is receiving consideration. Obviously we shall seek to get a point of view on it as early as possible. I take note of the hon. Gentleman's comments about next Thursday. But I think that this is a matter which can be discussed through the usual channels. On Tuesday next we can give an indication.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon. Gentleman agree that we shall not reach Clause 3 before Christmas 1976 the way we are progressing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><q><p>That during the proceedings on the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></q></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->: Before I call the first amendment I remind the Committee that there is a Financial Resolution in connection with the Bill. Copies are available in this room.</p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>DISSOLUTION OF SUGAR BOARD</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 1, in page 2, line 3, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>Provided that on the appointed day the Minister shall lay a report before each House of Parliament certifying the properties, rights and liabilities which are to be vested in him under the provisions of this subsection'.</p></q>
The clause which is meant to dissolve the Sugar Board—and that is not a pun in case the Minister of State were to take that as an excuse for some of his own excruciating ones in the course of the debate—is not one which, basically, we on the Conservative side of the Committee would wish to contest. Amendment No. 1 and the other amendments to this clause are probing amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Gavin Strang)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it is in order for me to raise a point of order, Mr. Costain. We should like clarification on the matter raised earlier by the hon. Gentleman in relation to the declaration of interests on a Standing Committee. Should the hon. Gentleman declare his interest? He has already done so on Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When an hon. Member has once declared an interest that is good enough for the rest of the proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must declare a further interest in relation to sugar, because it is extremely important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a director of Manbre Sugars and advise Manbre and Garton on certain matters, as the written declaration of interests will show. I declared this interest on Second Reading and I have no qualms whatever in repeating it now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
However, I have received no assistance whatever from my company on anything I might say. Indeed, I asked the managing director for a brief and he has not had time to write me one. Not only will there be a shorter debate, but I confirm that everything that I say on this issue is purely my personal view. I would never wish to speak on behalf of my company, because that is not my view of the function of a Member of Parliament who has an outside job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, perhaps, one thing that I can say on behalf of my company and, I suspect, on behalf of the whole industry. We should like to say how much we appreciate the work of the Sugar Board during the past few years. It would be wrong not to mention also the name of Sir George Dunnett, who contributed so much to the practical operations of that Board, and who could be described as its father. He was the gentleman whose administration of the Board made it well respected in the industry, and respected nationally and internationally. I know that my company would wish to be associated with those remarks. Everything else I wish to say is purely personal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Sugar Act 1956, the Sugar Board was constituted with two primary functions. The first function was to carry out the Government's contractual obligations to buy sugar at a negotiated price from producers under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement 1951. The second prime function was to enable the British Sugar Corporation to complement the Government's guarantee to home sugar beet growers under the Agriculture Act of 1947, subsequently modified by the Act of 1957.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is our accession to the European Economic Community which leads to the need for the dissolution of the Sugar Board. The functions of the Board as regards the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement are governed by Protocol 17 of the Treaty of Accession. The Committee is aware that the Agreement expired on 31st December 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since that time the Board's functions have been to operate the price equalisation scheme. This results from a mixture of obligations to the whole of the Common Market under the Lome Convention, and our particular obligations to ACP countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0022">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
The Committee will be aware that there are a considerable number of small countries in tropical regions, whose monoculture of cane sugar leads to a complete economic dependence on the prosperity of the sugar market. It is a matter of considerable pleasure that the Lome Convention now recognises this and allows the cane growers of the world a permanent market in Britain despite the competition from the European sugar beet grower, I hope that it will be a permanent market. The cane comes as raw sugar to be refined at six refineries—two in Greenock, one in Liverpool, one in Newton-leWillows and two in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no secret, indeed, it has been a matter for substantial debate over a number of years, that there is an excess of cane-refining capacity in the United Kingdom. The Government are under some pressure from various areas to reorganise that industry. It would be wrong of me to comment any further except to draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that this is now being negotiated with the Government. Both the companies concerned and trades union interests have made representations to the Minister recently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the results of the Lome Convention and our ensuing obligations under it, was an announcement in February that Britain would pay a guaranteed price of £260 a ton on ACP sugar shipped to the United Kingdom during the calendar year 1975. That price was, of course, considerably higher than the Community guaranteed price and the ACP countries, taking advantage of this agreement, have pressed the Government to ship their full quota during 1975. As from January 1976, only the Community guarantee will apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that in replying the Minister will comment on the implications of that decision. Those of us who are involved understand the difficulties with which the Minister was faced at that time. His action did ensure a supply of sugar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I might seek to draw some lessons from Government interference in the free flow of trade, but that would be ungenerous, Mr. Costain, since we seem to have gone from a chronic sugar shortage in one minute to a chonic sugar surplus in the next.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It would also be out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I bow to your ruling, Mr. Costain. But you will appreciate that from 1st January 1976, we will be operating under a longer term agreement and any information that the Minister can give would be of interest to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once the Lome Convention was signed and the world market saw that the price panic of 1974 was over—and there was a downturn in demand, incidentally, when the price went up to very high levels at that time—the market began to collapse. It has now reached a much more reasonable level. In May 1975, the right hon. Gentleman announced that all British refined sugar would be sold at a subsidised price, competing with beet sugar from the Community. The Exchequer agreed to pick up the bill for the losses involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that such a move was necessary, although its administration and the price paid is something in which the Public Accounts Committee is much more likely to be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Demand remains sluggish and the high United Kingdom guarantee price applies on sugar shipped to the United Kingdom in 1975, and not just on sugar delivered in 1975. It will, therefore, be about May of next year before the high-priced ACP sugar has gone through the manufacturing processes and been distributed. Consequently, it will not be until then that the present equalisation price arrangements—whereby all British refined sugar, whether from the beet refiners or the cane refiners, sells at the same price—can be abandoned, the market allowed to operate normally, and the Board wound up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since, however, the Board also controlled forward buying, it may be some time before the activities can be terminated. I suspect that the Government chose the opportunity of this Bill to slip this clause in, thus obviating the necessity for separate legislation. As such, I do not think we have any objection to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in subsequent amendments we shall be asking for certain assurances and questioning certain details—which I will not go into now—to make sure that we are content that this is being done in an above-board way and that there are no irregularities of a Parliamentary nature. I do not mean anything sinister, by that, merely that it is right that we should know what is happening to the Board's obligations and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another of the Board's responsibilities
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0023">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
is to administer the export discounts scheme, sometimes known as the EXIM scheme. This was introduced when the high price of sugar prevailing in this country made it difficult for manufacturers and processers to export foods containing sugar. I recall complaints from the rock manufacturers of Blackpool and other resorts who were, for a short time, put at a disadvantage in their daily trading operations. The Government rightly coped with that and, now that prices have dropped, this scheme is being phased out. Perhaps we could be told how that scheme worked and when it will finish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would, perhaps, be stretching your patience too far, Mr. Costain, if we were to talk about the question of subsidies. But, of course, the sugar market is a rigidly controlled one, and the price to the refiner and the price at which it is sold are fixed by the Government, and I am certain that under the amendment you would not rule the Minister out of order if he were to comment on the refining margin and the future for the cane industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British Sugar Corporation—set up originally, I suspect, to help East Anglian farmers, who were going through a period of considerable depression, who required an alternative product, and who has subsequently been a most useful contributor to the supply of sugar to the nation—has, as part of its shareholding, some 2,500 shares, which it holds on behalf of the Government until, presumably, this Bill becomes an Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is 21½2 million shares.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, I meant to say 2.5 million £1 shares and I think this represents about 36 per cent. of the equity capital of the British Sugar Corporation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that that would appear to be a matter for the next amendment and not for this one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to say, Mr. Costain, that, as we were to debate the future of the shares on the next amendment, I will not puruse this further, but as I was reviewing the whole of the Board's functions I hoped that you would not consider me out of order in mentioning the shareholding, and I inadvertently used
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
the wrong figures, which my hon. Friend corrected, I am glad to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Sugar Board currently employs some 15 permanent staff and most of these, of course, are civil servants transferred from other Ministries. We understand that when the Board is dissolved these gentlemen either will be found positions in other Ministries or will be retiring, and it would be helpful to the Committee if the Minister could say what will happen to these people, so that we may be satisfied that they are being properly looked after.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it is worth reflecting that the cost of running the Sugar Board is not inconsiderable for a board of about 15 staff—£200,000 a year. While considering the cost of bureaucracy in all fields, it is perhaps salutary to recall how expensive it is today to employ people and to provide office accommodation, services, telephones, pensions, and so on. This point merely highlights it. I am not suggesting that the cost is too high or reflects any inefficiency, but it is worthy of note in dealing with this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Board's only function now is to provide payments to this company and its rival?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did say in my opening remarks that I certainly had no intention of taking a company viewpoint. I do not think that that is quite fair because, of course, the Sugar Board was a trading organisation acting on behalf of the Government, and it is true to say that my company and Tate and Lyle were to some extent the only customers of the Sugar Board. But to say it was providing subsidies for other companies is a gross distortion of the truth, which I am not here to defend, and I hope that my hon. Friends will not press that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main reservation to this clause lies in the question whether the arrangement we have in the Community will manage to maintain steady supplies of cane sugar to the United Kingdom refiners. I do not want to be seen to be speaking on behalf of the cane refiners today, and I know that others of my hon. Friends will make the point of the necessity for dual sources of supply for strategic and competitive reasons, and I think that the case for employment, distribution and other matters is reasonably well known.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
There are difficulties in the new arrangement. No one wishes to hide that, and, as some terms are still being negotiated, the Minister may feel reticent about commenting on how these new contracts are progressing. That, I think, we would accept and understand. But I hope that, if not in this Committee, at an opportune moment the Minister will consider whether the Government should not give at least a progress report on the contractual arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, this is a probing amendment deliberately phrased widely to allow general debate and I am grateful to you, Mr. Costain, for not ruling me out of order. The Opposition have no objection to the principle of the clause, and I hope that the Committee will accept that it is necessary, however, to hear the Government's viewpoint on what is a fairly substantial alteration in the whole question of the acquisition of raw supplies to the sugar industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee is indebted to my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) for having taken the opportunity, and to you, Mr. Costain, for having allowed him such an opportunity, to enlarge on what is, in effect, a somewhat narrowly drawn amendment in order to pose questions of fundamental importance facing not only the refiners in this country but the sugar users. I look forward with keen interest to the remarks which I sincerely hope the Minister will make regarding future cane sugar supplies as opposed to beet sugar supplies, not only domestically, but from the EEC as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I refer to the amendment as it stands. It is a complex amendment to discuss without straying into the provisions of subsections (4) and (5). However, I think it proper for me to make the point that essentially the amendment seeks to cause the Government to lay a report before the House " on the appointed day " or thereabouts. One is extremely disconcerted at the fantastic delays that the House of Commons has to endure in terms of presentation of the accounts of the Sugar Board. I have before me the accounts for 1973, and I am assured by the Vote Office and the Library that these are the last accounts available
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
to the House. It may well be that the Minister is more updated than is the Library or the Vote Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may help the hon. Gentleman. The most recent report is up to 31st December 1974.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All that I have been able to obtain from the Library and the Vote Office are the accounts for 1973.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was reading a copy in the Vote Office at midnight of the most recent report, which was published a few days ago, and I understand it is in the Vote Office; indeed, I have this copy here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then it has only just arrived, because I made strenuous inquiries earlier this week. One cannot keep going back and forth to the Library. If it has just arrived and is in relation to December 1974 it means that virtually the whole of 1975 has elapsed. For the year ended 1973, we had the accounts laid before the House on 3rd July 1975. That was a time lag of 18 months. By any reckoning that is intolerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The balance sheet items of the Sugar Board deal principally with the current assets and liabilities and this takes one to the trading accounts. It is extremely difficult to imagine circumstances which cause such phenomenal difficulties in the presentation of these accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the point to which we shall inevitably be reverting in view of the implications of subsections (4) and (5). Perhaps the Minister can clear up quite a lot of ground because, judging from the 1973 accounts—I would not for one moment admit that it was my fault that I have not got the 1974 accounts; I have worn out quite a lot of shoe leather in endeavouring to obtain them—there were gross assets of £43·1 million. I am putting the shares of the British Sugar Corporation, not at nothing, but at the market value at that time, so I have added another £9·4 million to the printed figures. We have gross assets of £43·1 million and, correspondingly, net assets of £20·7 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Admittedly, in January 1973 the relative figures were very much lower. That reflects the volatility of the sugar market and the operations of the Sugar Board. Heaven alone knows what the figures
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0025">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
are in the accounts for 1974. I hesitate to guess whether they are higher or lower, but the accounts for the year ending December 1973 indicate gross assets of £43·1 million and net assets of £20·7 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a member of this Committee, I am not prepared to accept the clause without some very firm commitment by the Minister and the Sugar Board regarding the laying of accounts relative to the winding-up of the Sugar Board and relative to the appointed day referred to in subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the specific points I wanted to raise under this amendment. Perhaps the Minister, when he winds up, will tell us how he intends to develop the wider points about cane sugar and the more immediate points on the accounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One feels that it is almost a matter for jubilation that we have a Socialist Government introducing a provision which will bring a board to an end. It must be the only board that a Socialist Administration has brought to an end by legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We set it up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not you—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not set it up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government did go in for it eventually, and more is the pity, but the fact is that they are now bringing it to an end, and rightly so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The justification originally was to ensure that the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement worked satisfactorily. That justification was a commercial one, because at that time the cane sugar producers could produce more cheaply than our own beet growers. The statistics and accounts might show that still to be the case if the subsidy element were kept out. I know that some of my hon. Friends would not like to hear me say that. I shall not go into subsidies now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to see this amendment. I am not too happy about it. I do not think that the report is necessary. There is only one action that the Minister should take in respect of the Sugar Board—that is, dispose of all the assets and shares and take his fingers out of the sugar industry
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
as rapidly as possible. I do not see any real advantage in his submitting a report about these assets and liabilities. I appreciate that the amendment may be in the nature of a probing one to try to find out a little more from the Minister as to what his intentions may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister replies, perhaps he will say a little more than has been said recently about the future of cane sugar producers. We have read in today's newspapers about the price they are likely to receive. There will certainly be some hard and bitter negotiating with the Community and, as we know, that is not a novel experience for the cane sugar producers. It is notorious that in Brussels there is very little understanding of the problems of the cane sugar industry. Perhaps the Minister will say something about that, because it is of enormous importance to thousands of people. Unless they receive some assurance that the United Kingdom Government will support them in overcoming the difficulties that have largely been made by the United Kingdom Government, there will be very real dismay among them; nor would it be in the interests of this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to obtain sugar at a reasonable price. We have had that from the cane producers for generations and in the last two years, at a time where there has been tight control over the sugar industry, we have seen incredible fluctuations of sugar prices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One has always been led to believe that one of the purposes of State control is that these wild fluctuations can be limited and the price can be placed within a narrow bracket, but at one time we have seen a crazy price given to the cane sugar producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember giving a lecture to the Mauritian Chamber of Agriculture in Mauritius on the sugar industry and, as I stood up to give my talk, the chairman introduced me and said that that day they had received a message from London that the price had risen to the dazzling height of £200 a ton. They all agreed that it was a crazy, unrealistic price and it could only do harm to the sugar industry. We all know that that was only the beginning, and the price went up and up, causing great problems to the industry both here and in the Commonwealth. Now the price is falling again, as invariably it does when people monkey around with the economics of any agricultural commodity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
Perhaps the Minister would reply to what my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) has said and say something about the industry's future, because it is of enormous importance to many people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the next speaker, may I point out that the Chair is in some difficulty on this narrow, probing amendment. I remind the Committee that by allowing the debate to go a little further I have the power under Standing Order No. 48 to cut down the debate on the Question "That the Clause stand part of the Bill". I hope that hon. Members appreciate what is in my mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to join my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) in saying that, although we come from probably the largest sugar-beet growing area, we are concerned about some aspects of the cane-sugar industry and the producers who depend so much upon our market and the wider EEC market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was in Mauritius two years ago. The day I arrived there the price had reached £100 a ton, but my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) said it had doubled when he was there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to give a word of warning to my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super Mare concerning the refining side of the industry in this country. I have a strong feeling that before very long-10 years is not very long—there will be refining carried out in the sugar-producing countries. I think that must happen at some time. That fact should be considered in the long term, for our own industry and employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we cannot talk about the sugar industry unless we consider the question of all the supplies. If the Government are truly determined that our home industry shall prosper, I hope that the Minister, when replying—he is generally extremely helpful—will take the opportunity, which may not arise again to assure us that the Government will at least secure that the United Kingdom's basic quota of 1.04 million tonnes shall be home produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The home producers' confidence in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
sugar trade needs to be boosted, because we have had two appalling years, as the hon. Gentleman knows. They were nothing to do with the Government. Weather and pests were responsible for the situation. Two disastrous crops followed each other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic minimum price of £15 should be raised. As this is, I believe, the only debate we shall have on the topic during the Bill's proceedings, I hope that the Minister will give an assurance that when he or his right hon. Friend goes to Brussels, he will press for a Community price a little higher than that already given. Otherwise we shall not get the acreage put down and some of our EEC partners will be growing the crop instead of ourselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must not go too wide in my remarks, but the sugar industry is now so important that I suggest that possibly the Sugar Corporation might have a full-time Chairman. It needs one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dealing with the amendment, I should like to see the shares sold on the open market—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is speaking to the second amendment. We are discussing the first amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Costain. My colleague mentioned the second amendment earlier and I thought that it was possibly in order for me to do so, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we shall not see this Board and all its assets being enclosed within the Ministry, and that we shall not hear any more about it. We want to know what is happening to the shares, and I hope that we shall have information about their disposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I wish to raise two matters, one of which was fully covered by my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) and was touched on by my hon. Friend the Member for Westonsuper-Mare (Mr. Wiggin). My hon. Friend's remarks related to what I believe to be our main reservation to the clause under discussion. Will Community arrangements maintain a steady market for our Commonwealth suppliers, and will there always be secure supplies of sugar for consumers in this country?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0027">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
I shall not enter into the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins), and I can perhaps say what I want to say somewhat more easily than my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston, because I do not represent an area in which much sugar beet is grown. I am deeply concerned about the position of our traditional Commonwealth sugar suppliers. I believe that we have a responsibility towards those countries, and it seems ridiculous that Europe, which perhaps better than any other part of the world can provide excellent grassland for milk and beef production, and so on, should devote so much of its acreage to sugarbeet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether we should not recognise our responsibilities to other parts of the world, namely, the developing world and Third World countries, in policies which we are pursuing. I hope that the Minister of State will indicate what representations his right hon. Friend is making at the EEC about what sugar beet policy should be pursued and what the relationship of Europe to the Third World is likely to be in respect of cane sugar. The United Kingdom, perhaps more than any other country in Europe, has first-class grassland, which is not found in other parts of the world. Our grassland can produce excellent beef, milking cows, and so on. Should we not be devoting more attention to those commodities than to increasing acre after acre—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Might I interrupt my hon. Friend? Perhaps he would accept an invitation to visit East Anglia to see whether we can, in fact, grow excellent grass. I believe that the Midlands areas produce first-calss grass, but I submit that sugar beet and other arable crops are vital to East Anglia. They feed half of England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was fully aware that what I said would not be popular with some of my colleagues. But I remind my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West that my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston, whose constituency is not so many miles from him, reflected to some degree the views which I am now promoting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
You are being gracious, Mr. Costain, in allowing us to range wide on this somewhat narrow amendment, therefore I hope that the Minister in his reply will comment on the important matter I have raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second matter deals with Amendment No. 1, which reads:
	<br><q><p>"Provided that on the appointed day the Minister shall lay a report before each House of Parliament certifying the properties, rights and liabilities which are to be vested in him under the provisions of this subsection."</p></q>
I fully appreciate the reasons—although I regret them—why we have heard so little about liabilities, properties and rights. My hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare, mentioned the 15 full-time personnel employed by the Board, and we understand that most of them will be retiring or will be transferred to other Government Departments. It is interesting, though perhaps horrifying, to realise that the cost of funding the pension of one senior civil servant who retires is £500,000-worth of the taxpayers' money. Therefore, I believe that we should have from the Minister some details of the financial liabilities of the Board, as well as the amount of office space at present occupied, what is likely to happen to that office space, and what other properties, rights and liabilities are involved in respect of the provisions of the subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have made my points clear. I believe that my first argument, dealing with our traditional Commonwealth cane sugar suppliers, is important. I was particularly interested in the observation made by my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West that possibly in 10 years' time the traditional Commonwealth cane sugar suppliers will set up refining facilities in their own countries. Such a step would doubtless affect our attitude towards them and the policies that we may endeavour to force the Community to take in respect of those Commonwealth cane-sugar supplying countries. Many people here are involved in the refining industry. We have unemployment problems and we do not want to increase them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the subject will be fully studied and that the Minister will comment on it. I hope, too, that the hon. Gentleman will give us full details of the " properties, rights and liabilities " which are to be vested in the Minister under the provisions of Clause 1(1).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to prolong the deliberations, and I see no reason why we should not complete our discussion of the clause this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not follow the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton), except to recall, if he is to pay a visit to Norfolk, invited by my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins), a similar offer made in a Committee about 10 years ago, when we were promised a visit to see the Highlands of Norfolk. As a Member who represents possibly as high and mountainous an area as any in the country, I was looking forward to seeing the Highlands of Norfolk. They were as comparable as is Westminster to Hyde Park when we eventually saw these great mountainous areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin by declaring an interest, as I did on Second Reading, in that I am an owner of land which I farm myself. I am also a grower of sugar beet. I understand and accept that this debate may involve a curtailment of the debate on " Clause stand part". I support my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) in paying tribute to the Sugar Board and, in particular, to Ronnie Wall, who was known to many of us years ago. My hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) will remember the time when we were members of the Select Committee on Agriculture and Ronnie Wall was, I believe, one of the first civil servants to be cross-examined by a Select Committee of the type set up by the late Dick Crossman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also remember an interesting and pleasant visit I paid to the Board with my right hon. Friend the Member for Lowestoft (Mr. Prior) when he was the Minister. Before visiting the Board, I read the papers concerning its functions and realised that it was one of the most fiendishly complicated operations with which I had ever been concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister winds up, will he help us on the matters which have arisen? It is important that he gives details of the properties and the rights and liabilities which must be turned over. By not having the accounts, we are at a serious disadvantage, as my hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) pointed out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have read the Sugar Board's report to 31st December 1973, which it was kind enough to send to me a few days ago:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
indeed, I have the "With Compliments" slip here. I am afraid that I was totally mystified and unaware that there was a new set of accounts available. It is a great pity that we have not had the advantage of seeing the most up-to-date accounts, because since the end of 1973 there have been the most tremendous turbulances and fluctuations in the sugar market, and there has been more Government activity in the purchases of sugar than previously. We are at a great disadvantage if we have no idea except from the accounts of a year ago where we stand about rights and liabilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order, Mr. Costain may I suggest that copies of this report be made available to the Committee forthwith? This point will recur throughout the discussions on this clause and I am sure that you will appreciate that it is not a facile or debating point. We are in possession of accounts that date back to December 1973 and we are talking about very substantial figures. Other figures are avilable, we now understand. Yet whether it be through discourtesy, inefficiency or whatever, the Committee is not in possession of those figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the point first arose, the thought crossed my mind of how we could get these papers quicker to Members. In the last Session we had the difficulty of a printing strike. Even so, perhaps the Minister will note what has been said and report the matter to the relevant authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful if I were to say that the Sugar Board's annual report to 31st December 1974, was laid before this House on Tuesday 9th December, and was published on Wednesday 10th December. The report, therefore has been available for a few days. In order to check whether ordinary Members—and when I say ordinary Members, I refer to Members other than Ministers, who may have special facilities—had access to this report, I went to the Library last night and they made one available to me. I also went last evening and got one from the Vote Office. It has, therefore, been available, for several days. That is merely a note of explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0029">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Costain. I must protest with some vehemence. I exerted myself with great conscientiousness and endeavoured to prepare myself as well as I possibly could, as a private individual, for these proceedings. I take a serious view of the state of affairs. We are talking about substantial sums of money and I should like to put it on record that figures were not available two days ago in the Library of this House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is disputing that, I suggest we summon the Librarian forthwith. That is the fact of the matter. I think that I have been mucked about, and I am not here to be mucked about. Will the figures be laid before this Committee and be made available before we proceed much further, or will they not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind hon. Members that this Committee has no power to summon any Member or official of the House. I am, however, getting a message to the Vote Office to see whether the papers can now be made available to Members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Costain. It is a most extraordinary coincidence that these accounts are available only on the eve of the Committee proceedings of this Bill. One imagines that this has either been stage-rigged or, as the Minister has told us at such length about his detailed consultations on succession—which does not appear in the Bill—that those consultations are even more profound in the direction of the Sugar Board—which appears in the Bill and which has had ample forewarning of the situation. Here we have the availability of the accounts on the eve of this debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the same point of order, Mr. Costain. The Minister said, if my ears did not let me down, that the report had been published on 10th December. Therefore, the report has not been available for days. It has been available for a matter of hours. The Minister of State may think that it is a long time since yesterday, and that this Committee may seemingly have been sitting for a long time, too. But it is only
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
a matter of hours and I hope, therefore, that the report will be made available to this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are most obliged to you, Mr. Costain, for the quick response that you have made to the feelings of the Committee and I hope that the report will arrive in the room very shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having been sent the 1973 accounts by the Sugar Board, I would have thought that it must have realised that I wished to have them for this morning's debate. It is a pity that the Board did not also send me the up-to-date accounts, having been good enough to send me the previous year's accounts. However, it would be helpful if we could have that report as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this point, I think it is worth going back to the Sugar Act 1956, Section 6(5), which deals with this very matter of the annual report and accounts of the Sugar Board which says:
	<br><q><p>"As soon as may be after the accounts of the Board have been audited, the auditors shall transmit to the Minister copies of the statements of account together with their report thereon."</p></q>
It goes on to say that after submitting these reports to the Comptroller and Auditor General, and various other arrangements—the Minister shall:
	<br><q><p>lay copies thereof, together with his report thereon, before each House of Parliament".</p></q>
I ask the Minister to say how much delay there has been between the Board transmitting its accounts to the Minister and their being laid before the House? It is intolerable that such a long time exists between the end of a financial year and these reports becoming available to the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had a similar problem with other authorities. I remember complaining on exactly this point, about the Eggs Authority, I think. The Minister might be good enough to look into this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I think we should be told what is the present position of the Board, in view of the fact that none of us, apart from the Minister of State himself, has had the advantage of seeing any figures which are less than two years old.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have noticed, for instance, that in the Supplementary Estimates for 1975–76 page 41—which have been laid before the House—there is an extra amount of £75 million being made available for:
	<br><q><p>"Payments in implementation of guarantees to sugar refiners &c."</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0030">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
The original estimate laid before the House was for £50 million. It seems that the revised provision has now risen to £125 million. It would be helpful if we could discover to what extent this extra liability of £75 million has gone through the accounts of the Sugar Board and how this fits into the current situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter of great importance. I hope that the Minister realises that we feel that we are unaware of the situation that the Board will leave behind. These are important matters and the more the Minister can explain them to us the better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a wide-ranging, interesting and important debate on the subject of Amendment No. 1 although I suspect that some of the points made have gone far beyond it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may declare an interest like the rest of the Committee, I have 82 villages in my constituency, including many villages and areas where sugar beet is an important crop. I also have the British Sugar Corporation factory at Newark, which is one of the extensions taking place. Although I have no interest in the Corporation as an individual, I have an interest as a consumer. I appreciate the contributions of hon. Members in this debate. I start by answering some of the questions regarding the Board's report in the narrow context of Clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that hon. Members may have been inconvenienced by the date of publication of the report. This, of course, was not a matter for me. However, I understand that the report was brought forward as far as possible so that the Committee could have it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very considerate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am bound to say, in fairness to the Library—which was helpful—that I rang it last night and asked whether it had a copy of the report. I asked if I could borrow it and was told that it was available in the Vote Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would inform the Minister that the phrase "was brought forward" suggesting that this was for the convenience of the Committee adds insult to injury. Would we otherwise have been expected to deal with the winding-up of the Sugar Board without some grace
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
and favour gesture on the part of some auditors or the Chairman of the Sugar Board? Is that what he is saying? Will not the Minister come clean and say that he would not have proceeded with Clause 1 had this report not been available, and that he does not expect us to make much progress before we have had time to consider the report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that hon. Members would have appreciated any effort by the Sugar Board to ensure that up-to-date accounts were available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did not the Sugar Board know of the existence of this Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Had that not happened the Committee would not have had the most recent annual report and any other information which may have been made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 8 of the Sugar Board's sixteenth report says:
	<br><q><p>"Preparation of the 1973 accounts was held up by the problem of the refineries transitional stocks. This was not settled in principle until April 1974 by a regulation made by the EEC Commission."</p></q>
The Board's report is here, and I am sure that hon. Members will have a copy of it and will be able to make even more use of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order Mr. Costain. May I suggest that one official goes to the Vote Office to see whether this document is available and bring us a supply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already indicated to the Committee that I have sent an official down to the Vote Office. I am waiting with patience to see what has happened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is taking some time to come back.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order Mr. Costain. The Minister will appreciate that this is a serious matter. I am in a dilemma because I have absolutely no wish—I hope the Minister will understand this—to delay the procedures of the Committee. I said earlier that I hoped that we would be able to complete consideration of the clause this morning. I had not fully
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0031">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
realised the difficulty that we are likely to be in about the non-availability of these latest figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there are procedures whereby it would be in order for us to postpone further deliberation of the Bill until we have had an opportunity to see these figures and the latest report. Would the Minister be prepared to consider this? I believe there is a procedure whereby postponement could be proposed at this stage of our deliberations in view of what has happened. I plead with the Minister to understand that I am not trying in a dilatory way to delay the Committee's proceedings and deliberations. But if he would give consideration to adjourning this Sitting it would be very helpful. We could then give him the assurance that we would proceed with the greatest despatch when we meet again on Tuesday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are powers vested in the Chair so that, should such a situation arise, part of the clause can be postponed and held over until a later date. However, that does not mean that we can all adjourn and go to lunch. If it is decided that the papers are not available, my ruling would be that we can postpone this clause—provided there has not been an amendment agreed to it. Once an amendment has been agreed my powers cease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that the documents have arrived. Perhaps we can allow the Minister to proceed with his reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain. May I move, that consideration of the clause be postponed? I refer to your recent intervention. I do not think that we can reasonably be expected to take in these figures within a matter of moments. The implications of the accounts run throughout the whole of this clause. They do not merely affect this amendment. I am certainly not prepared to come along here and act merely as a rubber stamp.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot take two motions at the same time. If the hon. Member wishes to move that motion, it will be necessary for the original motion to be withdrawn. If the hon. Member who moved the original motion wishes to withdraw it, I can accept the new motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
However, it might be for the convenience of the Committee if it was to hear the Minister on this matter. While all our minds are concentrated upon it, it would be better to let the Minister reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Ellis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I do not wish there to be any misunderstanding. If it were agreed that the amendment should be withdrawn, by leave, what would be the position thereafter of that amendment? I would not like any hon. Member to feel that his fox has been shot and that discussion had been curtailed. Would he be allowed to bring it back? We must make progress and we could spend a long time on that subject. It would be helpful if you could give us some guidance, Mr. Costain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position is that the amendment could not be reconsidered. It would not be beyond the wit of hon. Members to find another amendment which could be debated. The Committee is progressing quite well and it would be better to let the Minister finish his statement. We can then make a decision about withdrawing the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I am duly seized of the feeling of the Committee. I am glad that we have been sweetened by the arrival of the Sugar Board's report in due time. In all fairness, hon. Members have not had time to be appraised of the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously the Sugar Board, like any other concern, would have been anxious to get its report out as soon as possible. The report was sent to the Ministry, and it has had to be printed. I am glad that it is before us for the rest of our Sittings. But, of course, whatever I say on this amendment, we only have about 30 minutes before the Committee adjourns. I am sure hon. Members will have the opportunity to go more deeply into the report before we proceed on the next amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dealing with the more narrow aspects of the amendment, its effect is to require the Minister to give Parliament particulars of the assets and liabilities of the Sugar Board which are to be transferred to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment may be to compel the Minister to give the Committee information about these assets and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0032">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
liabilities on a certain date. Hon. Members will have the chance to read the report. There is nothing of substance to add to the information now available to hon. Members and I feel that there is no justification for submitting a report to Parliament in the particular way called for in the amendment. The transfer is one of responsibility only and, as such, does not constitute any change in the Exchequer's liabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various hon. Members have asked me about assets, liabilities and other matters relevant to this discussion. The main asset is the Board's holding of 22 million shares in the British Sugar Corporation, to which the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) referred. This, I understand, is about 25 per cent. of the holding and not the figure which I think he gave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fixed assets are of a very minor nature, such as office fittings, furniture and the inexpired portion of the lease of the Board's premises. The particulars of these assets are substantially the same as those given in the 17th Annual Report of the Sugar Board which is now before us. However, it is envisaged that the Board will dispose of its assets shortly before the appointed day so that it is unlikely that they would ever be vested in my right hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Board is not expected to have any significant liabilities at dissolution, except in relation to pension arrangements and possibly redundancy payments. All the borrowings from the National Loans Fund should have been paid off by then and discussions as to redundancy payments are in progress with the Civil Service Department. I believe that some members may be absorbed into the Civil Service in the normal way of recruitment, and that others may be leaving the Service. The redundancy terms will not exceed those applicable generally to civil servants. The main body of redundancy payments will be made by the Board before the assets are transferred. Some small payments in this connection might fall to the Exchequer hereafter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Board's pension plan for staff pensions consists of a fund held by an insurance company administered by trustees who will continue to provide the pensions as these become payable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will take over responsibility for the payment of pensions to a former chairman and the widow of a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
former member of a board who are outside the plan, but the capital sums equivalent to the actuarial value of the two pensions will be paid from Sugar Board funds to the Civil Superannuation Vote prior to dissolution to cover the cost of the pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only new charges that could arise with regard to pensions, therefore, would be the result of any annual review of pensions with respect to the cost of living index or an actuarial review which found the fund in deficit, neither of which can be evaluated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make the point that there will be no new charge on the Exchequer, because under section 7(2) of the European Communities Act 1972, the Exchequer already bears any expenses of the Sugar Board not covered by dividends from its holdings of BSC British Sugar Corporation shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The transfer of liability under Clause 1 to my right hon. Friend the Minister is, therefore, a transfer of responsibility and not an increased charge on the Exchequer. I therefore believe that this amendment is unnecessary in relation to the aims of those who propounded it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the Minister's reply. I think it is important. Is he able to specify any figures—estimated or approximate—because it is very easy to discuss the subject generally? It is much easier for the Committee to appreciate the full situation if we are given figures, but so far he has not mentioned one, except the 21½ million shares.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could deal with that on this amendment, or it may arise under " Clause stand part". Hon. Members may think that would be a better time for it, or on a later amendment when they have had the chance to read the report of the Sugar Board, which goes carefully into the details of some of these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have raised other points with regard to the sugar negotiations in Brussels, which I hope to answer without straying beyond the bounds of order. This matter was raised by the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body). The Community has given a generous guarantee of access for ACP sugar for unlimited duration. I understand that the commitment will be honoured and there is no need to think that the Commission will negotiate otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0033">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
With regard to the questions raised by the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr, Stainton) about the future of sugar cane supplies, the Lome agreement, about which we all know, gave long-term guarantees of access for ACP sugar. The assurance was given by the Council of Ministers that that sugar should follow what are known as the traditional channels of trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the point raised by the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) about the implications of Government guarantees of £260 a ton and thereafter, it seems that the supplement agreed by the Government to the basic ACP price in 1975 was reasonable, given the high world price and the need to guarantee supplies to the United Kingdom, which need was very important at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for 1976, sugar shipped after 1st January will be paid for at a price negotiated by the Commission. The hon. Member will know of the discussions and negotiations which are now being carried on. The discussions on the price of the 1976–77 supplies will be held shortly in tandem with the negotiations with all the other commodities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) raised the point regarding the European beet policy in relation to the developing world. The Lome quota allowed 1.4 million metric tonnes of ACP sugar as against only 1.3 million tonnes offered by the ACP countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding the hon. Gentleman's comment about grass versus sugar beet, I think he will recognise the policy which is set out in the White Paper "Food From Our Own Resources", which makes the point about the importance of grass in relation to this matter. He will also know of the plan in relation to our sugar prospects in the 1980s where we anticipate providing about 50 per cent. of our sugar supplies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Referring to other aspects which have been raised, the report of the Sugar Board covers many of the points made by the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare about the very great changes which have taken place in the world market price for sugar. The introduction refers to the peak periods, the decline in price and the negotiated price quota for sugar bought and sold by the Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
We all recognise that sugar supplies have been uncertain and unpredictable for some time. We have the particular problems and responsibility which we held formerly to ACP countries, and the desire to ensure that negotiations after our entry to the Market were not adverse to them. These points have been taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but those remarks might make the casual reader of 	<i>Hansard</i> think that it was the responsibility of the Sugar Board to arrange sugar prices. It was not, of course. It was the responsibility of Governments of both parties. The Sugar Board is an instrument of government in this respect. Will the Minister clarify that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I certainly did not want to give the impression that the Sugar Board was responsible. Indeed, in the very complex negotiations which have taken place in the last year or two, certainly before and since the ending of the ACP agreement, a considerable amount of work has had to be done. My right hon. Friend has been concerned, as the Committee knows, in protracted negotiations with ACP countries which, naturally, wanted to get the best price in the prevailing situation. Agreement was reached and then, of course, there were the negotiations with the EEC and their part in this. Probably the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare is more aware than most of us of the negotiations in Brussels on the future of sugar supplies and the changes which may have to take place in the reorganisation of sugar supplies in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the concern of hon. Members on the amendment. However, I can reassure them that it is not necessary, as there are safeguards already in the Bill about reporting back to Parliament after the appointed day. In the long term, the main job of the Government, the Community and other suppliers, and, of course, of others involved in the sugar industry, is to ensure security of sugar supplies. In saying this, of course the interests of all those concerned, must be recognised, and it will be necessary for us to increase our production of sugar unit! the situation envisaged in the White Paper, to which I have referred, arises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0034">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify one point? In the document "Food From Our Own Resources" it was established that we hoped to produce about 50 per cent. of our own requirements by that time. Will this affect the assurances that we have given to the old traditional Commonwealth sugar supplying countries of the 1.4 million tonnes which they will be allowed to send into the EEC? Are we saying to them that in fact this is not as long-term as perhaps we have implied or that Europe is likely to take more of the Commonwealth sugar than it has done, and us less? If the Minister does not agree with that comment, is he saying that our consumption of sugar will go up and that there will still be a good market for the 1.4 million tonnes, in addition to the 50 per cent. that we hope to produce for our own requirements, which will inevitably involve a greater acreage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have referred to the fact that in the White Paper, Her Majesty's Government are fully behind the aims that the United Kingdom beet industry should achieve 50 per cent. self-sufficiency by 1980. I understand that the price for 1976–77 will be settled soon and the Government will, of course, press for a price which will restore confidence. This is very important. However, given normal yields, the return should be good for the BSC guaranteed prices for the coming year. At the same time, we have to take into account the wish of the ACP countries to supply sugar to us and the Community and also, of course, the views of the Community itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the long run, the main objective must be to ensure security of supplies for our consumers and, at the same time, to ensure that in whatever form we receive sugar, whether through the raw cane or the beet, our refiners have sufficient capacity to deal with the supply situation. All these matters are very much under consideration at the present time, and I hope that we may soon have some idea of the outcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that few commodities have interested more Governments over a longer period—with the possible exception of brandy—than sugar. It is, perhaps, for that reason that the whole question of the sugar industry is so
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
immensely complex. I should certainly like to congratulate the Minister on his apparent grasp of at least some of the points made this morning, because, as I know to my own cost, it is a very complex subject which I suspect takes many people almost a lifetime to learn thoroughly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think we shall wish to press the amendment, and in due course, Mr. Costain, I shall seek your leave to withdraw it. But I have two small points to raise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first concerns pensions. We do not in any way begrudge proper pension rights to members of the Sugar Board and their families. I imagine that these are to be on a par with Civil Service pensions. One inevitably asks whether they will be inflation-proofed in the way that other Civil Service pensions have been. My reason for asking is to make sure that a civil servant, who may in the course of his career transfer to the Sugar Board, is not, relatively speaking, to be worse off than if he had stayed in his original Department, although I would not wish that remark to be interpreted as approving of inflation-proof pensions, as I do not. However, we shall not go into the politics of that. This is merely a question of looking after the interests of the individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not certain whether my interpretation of the hon. Gentleman's remarks about the necessity for the report is correct. Subsection (3) seems to provide that the accounts will in any event be prepared to the final day—that being the appointed day—and he argues that for that reason our amendment may not be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) invented a new word this morning. He described something as being a "turbulation", which seems to me a very good way of describing the discovery by this Committee that we were without the 1974 accounts. We certainly had a "turbulation" this morning. I believe that my hon. Friends will wish to say something about this in a moment, and it is clear that the subsequent amendments are more concerned with financial matters than is this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am satisfied that, as a result of this wide-ranging debate, we have managed to explore the majority of the points raised. Does the Minister wish to make a brief reply before I seek to withdraw the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0035">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>51</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to say much more other than that I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's comment about the report. As I said, the report had to go to the Ministry and had to be printed, and I think it was published as soon as possible. I know that hon. Members will be able to study it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with the amendment. The gist of it was that there should be a report laid before Parliament on the appointed day. Obviously this presents difficulties because it would be very hard to get a report on the day the order was made or to know the exact liability at that time. I say that in relation to the discussion on the report this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) has tabled an amendment, and I would ask you, Mr. Costain, to consider it because, in my estimation, the Minister cannot satisfactorily reply to the debate until we have had an opportunity to present certain points arising out of the report we have only just received. I have one or two concrete matters that I wish to put to the Minister, but should like first to consider them more carefully than we have been able to so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member puts me in a difficult position, because, as he has spoken after an hon. Member has sought leave to withdraw an amendment, I have to put the Question on the amendment. There was not a motion before the Committee because, as I pointed out, the hon. Member could not move a motion while we had another motion before the Committee. I am now bound to put the Question on the amendment, so the hon. Member has himself defeated any object he had in mind when he raised that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I shall go further to help him. The second amendment concerning shares would give the hon. Member ample opportunity to discuss the finances of the corporation and it might probably be more in order than some of the debates so far this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain. Will it be in order for me
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
to move the seconding of the withdrawal of this amendment? I am a signatory to it. I shall seek to do this expressly—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I do not know why there is amusement at this. I have to search for words, but this is a different area to explore. I am not, perhaps, as fluent as some Labour Members, but do have patience. I will get there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am seeking guidance, Mr. Chairman, as to whether I could formally second the withdrawal of this amendment on the grounds that the reply has, of necessity, been inadequate—at least in its interpretation and comprehension by Conservative Members, given the denial to them of even the 1974 figures of the Board—and then seek to relate that situation, albeit out of date, to the current Supplementary Estimates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may help the hon. Member on this point, there is no such provision of which I am aware, and my expert advice confirms this. An hon. Member cannot second the withdrawal of an amendment. An hon. Member can second a nomination for the Yacht Club but not in the withdrawing of an amendment. The position is this—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all at sea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) who moved the amendment has asked leave to withdraw it. Under the Standing Orders of the House if any Member says so much as "Boo" after that, I am bound to put the Question. Therefore, I have no alternative—I can allow the debate to continue but I cannot now allow the hon. Member to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the simplest way around this matter would be for the Committee to give leave for this amendment to be withdrawn on the basis, as I understand it, that you would have to put the Question. I hope that the Government will not oppose that. I am glad to see the Minister is nodding his head. If you could put the Question we could then withdraw the amendment and then my hon. Friend could move that we consider the next clause and return to this clause on another occasion. I imagine that that would meet the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0036">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>53</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the Orders of the House are not as flexible as that. The position is that I have to put the Question. The Committee can negative the Question. From that moment on that amendment is dealt with and we go on to the next amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no point in going on to another clause, since I have pointed out that the finances of the Sugar Corporation can be discussed on the next amendment which deals with the shares of the Corporation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. We have been debating the Sugar Board, not the finances of the British Sugar Corporation, which, thank Heaven, have to correspond to the rules of the Stock Exchange. It has reasonably available, up-to-date accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not suggest that there has been a lapse in your terminology, Mr. Chairman, but it is the Sugar Board with which we are concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I attempt to be helpful? I had to leave the Committee, to pursue the consultations which the Conservative Members advised me to pursue in relation to New Clause I when Iunderstand that you, Mr. Chairman, said that, in your infinite generosity, you would allow us to expand the discussion on the first amendment to something akin to that of a "clause stand part" debate. Some of us, myself for example, who have been waiting to take part in such a debate will still wish to do so, once we know what has happened to this amendment. Is it not the case that those who feel that they cannot discuss this point about the Sugar Board on the second amendment could, discuss it during the " clause stand part " debate? This would deal with their problem and mine too.

The Chairman: I know the hon. Member was out of the Committee on urgent business. Had he been in attendance he would have heard me say that I was having difficulty in keeping debate on this rather narrow amendment in order. I said that I would use the powers which I have under Standing Order No. 48, to stop any debate on the motion That the clause stand part of the Bill. The Minister, when he wound up, made special reference to the fact that he was dealing with certain items that would have come under such a debate. I am afraid that the hon. Member,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
by being absent, has lost his opportunity. We may go back to where we were.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:With respect, Mr. Chairman, I think that your ruling was absolutely correct and in one sense I anticipated it. The problem is that though you made your ruling, in absolute propriety, if an amendment is accepted the clause becomes different. Your ruling that there should not be a "clause stand part" debate, would be altered if the clause were altered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is, of course, as always, quite correct. If I sense the feeling of the Committee, I am under the impression that the amendment might be negatived. Then the argument would not quite follow. So may I just put the Question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. On the second amendment, Mr. Costain, will you use your considerable discretion and flexibility to allow the points which my hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge would like to raise on this amendment to be made, in the light of the new evidence in the report that has just come to us? Will you allow him the discretion to raise these matters on the second amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No Chairman can be asked to anticipate what he will allow or not allow until he hears the words of wisdom of the hon. Members.

The situation is basically this. If by chance the clause is negatived, I still have the powers to postpone the Committee, but having looked at the clock, which says four minutes to One o'clock, that course would seem to be a sledgehammer to crack a nut. If the Minister, after the Question on the amendment has been decided, cares to move " That the Committee do now adjourn," I think that the three minutes would be better spent in other places than debating the next matter.

If an hon. Member seeks to withdraw his amendment and another Member speaks, I cannot allow the amendment to be withdrawn. We have to vote on it. So may I try again?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it would be of tremendous convenience at this moment, in view of the new set of figures which have been provided for us, if we could now adjourn. I therefore beg to move,
