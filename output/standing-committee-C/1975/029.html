	<p>DUTY TO NOTIFY COMPANY OF ACQUISITION ETC. OF VOTING SHARES</p>
	<p>(1) In section 33 of the Act of 1967 (duty to notify company within fourteen days of acquisition etc. of shares amounting to one tenth or more of relevant share capital) for the words "one tenth" and "fourteen days" wherever they occur, there shall be respectively substituted the words "the prescribed percentage" and "three days".</p>
	<p>(2) In the said section 33 as amended by subsection (1) above "the prescribed percentage" means 5 per cent. or such other percentage as may from time to time be prescribed for the purposes of that section by regulations made by the Secretary of State by statutory instrument, and different percentages may
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0666">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
be so prescribed in relation to companies of different classes or descriptions.</p>
	<p>(3) No regulations shall be made under subsection (2) above unless a draft of the instrument containing the regulations has been laid before Parliament and has been approved by resolution of each House of Parliament.</p>
	<p>(4) In the case of a company which at the time when this section comes into operation, is one to which the said section 33 applies, every person who at that time is interested in shares comprised in relevant share capital of the company of a nominal value equal to 5 per cent. or more but less than 10 per cent. of the nominal value of that share capital shall be under an obligation to notify the company of the subsistence of his interests at that time and the number of shares comprised in that share capital (specifying it) in which each interest subsists at that time.</p>
	<p>(5) Subsection (4) to (10) of the said section 33 (which relate to the enforcement and interpretation of that section) shall have effect in relation to subsection (4) above as they have effect in relation to subsection (2) of that section but as if in subsections (5) and (9) for references to three days there were substituted references to fourteen days and as if in subsection (5) for references to the prescribed percentage there were substituted references to 5 per cent.</p>
	<p>(6) If regulations under subsection (2) above come into operation whereby the prescribed percentage for the purposes of the said section 33 is reduced, subsections (4) and (5) above shall apply in the case of a company in relation to which the regulations have effect as in the case there mentioned but with the substitution—
	<ol>
	<li>for references to the time when this section comes into operation of references to the time when the regulations come into operation; and</li>
	<li>for references to 5 per cent. and 10 percent. of references to the reduced percentage and the percentage prior to the reduction.</li></ol></p>
	<p>(7) Neither this section nor any regulations made under subsection (2) above shall be construed as requiring the notification by any person of the occurrence of an event before the time when this section or the regulations come into operation; and subsection (1) above does not affect the time for fulfilling any obligation which arose before the time when this section comes into operation.</p>
	<p>(8) For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that where the relevant share capital of a company to which the said section 33 applies is divided into different classes of shares, references in that section and this section to a percentage of the nominal value of its relevant share capital are references to a percentage of the nominal value of the issued shares comprised in each of those classes taken separately.—[	<i>Mr. Higgins</i>]".</p>

	<p>STANDING COMMITTEE C</p>
	<time>Tuesday 29th June 1976</time>
	<p>[MR. RICHARD CRAWSHAW 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>COMPANIES (No. 2) BILL [LORDS]</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Clinton Davis)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Companies (No. 2) Bill [	<i>Lords</i>], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></blockquote>
It might be for the convenience of the Committee if I said something about the way in which the Government view the progress of this Bill, particularly in the light of some of the amendments and new clauses which have been tabled. I do not suggest this has been an improper move by those who tabled the amendments, but we regard this as a modest, though important, Bill which will produce urgently-needed changes. It is, however, only the first stage in a much more ambitious programme of company law reform. I understand the inclination of hon. Members on both sides to widen the scope of our discussions to cover a variety of important and interesting proposals currently emanating on company law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government could easily have been tempted into including, for example, disclosure provisions in company reports, but we realise that this would have made the Bill controversial and prejudiced its chances of being enacted this Session. We decided not to take this action, although we intend to legislate on the subject at the earliest opportunity. We are preparing a consultation document on improving the scope of company reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether the Opposition would have wanted us to include such provisions, bearing in mind that we agreed that the procedure for Second Reading Committee should be undertaken. I know the answer to that question and so does the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins). The risk is that if we embark upon many weeks of interesting debates covering a variety of subjects
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
included in the new clauses we shall imperil the Bill, and there will be no legislative time in the next Session in which to resurrect it. This would do a great deal of damage. A number of bodies outside Parliament see the Bill as a welcome and urgently-needed reform. Another place had the opportunity substantially to widen the area of debate in the Bill, but chose not to do so. I ask hon. Members to forbear from doing so as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope the Minister will not go at any great length on this matter. His arguments could be used on individual amendments. They are not relevant to the Sittings motion. It is for the Chair to decide whether amendments are within the scope of the Bill. If they are, it is for the Committee to consider them. The Minister is indicating that many of the amendments go beyond what was originally intended in the Bill. That is for the Chair to decide, and I hope the Minister will not proceed too long on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like your further guidance, Mr. Crawshaw. What I have to say is about how long the Committee is likely to sit and the period through which it might have to sit. I should have thought these facts were relevant to the Sittings motion. May I be permitted to elaborate, not at too great a length, on that aspect? If we embark upon the changes envisaged in many of the amendments, we run a severe risk of imperilling the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made his point quite amply to me and, I am sure, to other hon. Members. If we discuss amendments which the Minister thinks will increase the scope of the Bill to any great extent, the Committee will sit for a longer time. That is obvious. Whether the Chair selects the amendments is a different matter. I think the Minister had in mind a particular length of time for the Committee proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we embark on very wide-ranging debates we shall unquestionably limit the possibilities of dealing with, for instance, filing accounts and returns and the position of auditors. I know some hon. Members have reservations on these matters, but I think they are mistaken. There is widespread support for the powers we are seeking to introduce. These are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0671">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
matters which could detain the Committee. I do not want to inhibit discussion or cause hon. Members to have to sit unduly late in considering what is essentially a technical, though important, Bill. I hope lion. Members will accept that we propose to embark on the sort of widespread legislation which they have in mind, but that this Bill is not the right vehicle for it. I do not wish to incur your disfavour, Mr. Crawshaw, just nine minutes after embarking on consideration of the Bill, but I hope that we shall be able to identify the salient matters which we should be discussing within the Bill and that the Committee will resist the temptation to go into wider spheres.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terence Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was helpful of the Under-Secretary to spell out the Government's position on the timing and priorities in the consideration of the Bill. Clearly the Department of Trade has not been very successful, to say the least, in getting the Leaders of the House to give priority to company legislation. When we were in Government we had a Bill going through the House, but it fell with the first General Election in 1974. Since then there has been procrastination for more than two years and nothing has been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been discussing the Insolvency Bill in another Committee. It covers some of the same ground and we have suggested that some clauses in that Bill should be in this Bill and 	<i>vice versa.</i> There is a close link between the two measures. The Minister says that this is a modest Bill. We agree that it has much to be modest about. The Government have got their priorities wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is not adequate time to get the Bill through—and events on the Floor of the House have changed the situation since Second Reading—the Government should delay the Bill till the next Session. The Under-Secretary was very helpful in adjourning proceedings on the Insolvency Bill for two weeks to enable further consultations to take place. That would be the right thing to do on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should introduce legislation on a number of points, some of which are covered by this Bill, and as soon as possible consistent with proper debate, and it should include those matters on which there is no reason for delay. The Under-Secretary said that if we delayed the Bill, it might be lost for years, but it is for the Government to
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
decide what Bills are considered this Session and what business is conducted in the next Session. It is up to the Minister to fight it out with the Leader of the House and those responsible for the Government's legislative programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite what we all hoped on Second Reading, this Bill cannot reasonably be expected to get through in this Session. Therefore the Government should postpone it and introduce a wide-ranging measure in the next Session. Its provisions need not necessarily be controversial, though some of them might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall be having a huge chunk of company legislation as a result of the Bullock Committee report on employee participation and further legislation may be required on the implications of the Sandilands Committee proposals. These reports are quite separate. The Minister also envisages another major Bill concerned with some matters which should be in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were right to put down our amendments. Our proposals on warehousing, for instance, could be dealt with in this Bill, or, preferably, in a more comprehensive Bill early in the next Session. Our amendments on insider dealing are primarily probing amendments because we recognise the subject may require further consideration and consultation. Some of the amendments tabled, with great skill, by my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not wish to be discourteous to the hon. Member. The Minister made his point and the hon. Member is now saying what the amendments are. We know what they are. We are now considering a Sittings motion. The hon. Member is saying which amendments should be made. There is all the time in the world for Committees to sit if their business has to be completed. I am ready to sit seven days a week if necessary. The matter for the Committee to decide now is whether it wants to sit on Tuesdays and Thursdays or at other times and whether we require further time. I hope the hon. Member will conclude shortly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly, Mr. Crawshaw. The point I was making about the Sittings motion is that it seems to us, given the changing situation downstairs, that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0672">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
there will not be adequate time for us to get it through by the end of the Session in a form in which we believe it ought to be. The sensible thing is for the Government to delay the Bill till the next Session so that we can have a better Bill which includes those things which need to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The heart of this Bill is auditing. It is well known that, as a result of the massive inquiry which is being published by the inspectors in the case of the London and County Securities Group—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is not on the Sittings motion in discussing this. All we are discussing at the moment is the Sittings motion. I hope the hon. Member will not refer to other things which are part and parcel of other debates when we come to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, Mr. Crawshaw, that is not the point. If we proceed with the Sittings motion as proposed by the Minister then we shall not have the advantage of the reports of those outside bodies carrying out inquiries as a result of this report which is relevant to this Bill. In short, I suggest that we should not sit on Tuesdays and Thursdays on this Bill because we do not yet have from outside bodies advice relevant to the Bill. It seems to me that it is entirely in order that I should make that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has made a point. Hon Members could make similar points and we could go on all day discussing them. This is a matter of opinion, not a matter of fact. I hope the hon. Member will not proceed on these lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The fact is that these outside bodies which will make recommendations have not yet reported. That is a question of fact, and in view of that the Minister should not proceed with the Sittings motion but defer the matter till next Session. That is purely the point I am making. I hope we shall get an undertaking from the Minister, in view of that, that he will not go ahead with this Sittings motion and with these particular clauses when we have not got the advice of outside bodies and neither have the Government formed a conclusion as a result of the report on the London and County Securities Group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that point I can say this. The matters covered by the working party are largely questions affecting professional practice and etiquette except for one matter which the hon. Member for Kensington (Sir Rhys Williams), will be alluding to and on which I hope to be making a fairly reasonable response—from his point of view. In all other respects the information we have is that there is no requirement for postponement of this Bill or the provisions relating to auditing. They are widely welcomed, and should be encouraged in what is, after all, a continuing process of fairly rapid legal development in this branch of the law. It would be folly not to go ahead with provisions that have met with widespread approval of the professions and everybody with whom we have consulted. The hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) should reconsider the stance he has taken rather than ask me to reconsider mine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not disputing for one moment that the provisions in this Bill are likely to improve the situation. That is the case. We are not against them as we made clear at Second Reading. However, in the light of the London and County report and the inquiries subsequently being carried out it may well be better to introduce into this Bill the recommendations which those bodies make. If we legislate now and the Bill goes through we shall be stuck with something which is immediately out of date. If we delay the Bill till next Session we can take those points into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. What the hon. Member is suggesting is completely wrong on a Sittings motion. The Sittings motion is to decide when we sit, not whether we sit. The Bill has had a Second Reading and been submitted to this Committee for consideration, which means that, all things being equal, we should proceed with the Bill. The hon. Member is giving reasons why we should not proceed with the Bill. That is not part and parcel of the Sittings motion. I hope we can proceed and at least get the Sittings motion dealt with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned with what the Minister says—that on the basis of two sittings we may not complete the Bill this Session.

unpopular with my hon. Friends, but so many millions of our countrymen spend so much of their working lives in joint stock companies and if we are not satisfied with the situation of joint stock company law we should do something about it and not just proceed in a leisurely fashion and allow the Bill to be lost. There are in the Bill some things which are recognised as urgent and which cannot be delayed. There are some things which I feel are decidedly wrong, and that is why I spoke against the Bill as it stood on Second Reading. I do not want to insist on a vote. I shall not do anything which will result in unnecessary delay. I undertake that. This is an important Bill and not modest. It ought to have proper consideration, and proper consideration now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should be clear from the Minister whether he thinks this Bill will get through on the basis of this Sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If we are united in the purpose of speeding progress I will keep an eye on the situation together with the Government Whip, and, I hope, the hon.

Crawshaw. At the moment we have a large string of amendments. There are three separate points. One is the distinction between public and private companies. The second is the distinction on grounds of whether they are large or small businesses. The third is the distinction whether they are dormant or active companies. The arguments on these three kinds are somewhat different. It would be more convenient if we separated out the arguments on these three. We may certainly wish to take a different view on Divisions regarding the three in the light of the Minister's replies. If that is so it would be easier to group them—public and private, size, whether dormant or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not take exception to that provisional selection, but perhaps I might suggest an alternative which may commend itself simply in terms of principles without developing the arguments. I would suggest that Amendments 1, 12 and 17 might be taken together; there should be a separate debate on Amendments 10, 86, 85 and 84; and another on 73 and 75. Perhaps that may be what the hon. Gentleman is suggesting. I have not been able to identify the numbers from his comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have noted what the Minister has said. Are not Amendments 73 and 75 consequential on Amendment No. 1? Then we should debate them together. Then we should debate Amendments 86, 85, 84 and 10 and then Amendments 12 and 17. If that meets with the agreement of the Committee I will move along those lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggested 1, 12 and 17. I accept that 73 and 75 might go together, and then 10, 84, 85 and 86.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Minister is wrong. It is amendments Nos. 1, 73 and 75 which go together. They refer to public, as opposed to private companies. Amendments Nos. 12 and 17 are the definition by size, excluding whether they have private or public status. So I think the grouping is right: Nos. 1, 73 and 75 and then 12 and 17.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Amendments No. 73, in Clause 34, page 31, line 39, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"company' means any private or public company which in the current accounting reference period or in any of the three accounting reference periods previous to the current accounting reference period has—

	<p>No. 75, in page 31, line 41, at end insert—

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I shall not transgress a ruling but I only want to say a little on the subject because the object of Amendment No. 1 is probing, to give the Minister an opportunity to explain his thinking on the way we should divide companies for the purposes of legislation. I have tried to introduce the concept of a major public company as an organisation different from the minor public company. There are differences of treatment necessary in company law, according to what one is trying to deal with. For instance, a private company should be dealt with separately from a public company in matters like share transfer, but from the point of view of employees, if a company employs 5,000 people, whether it is public or private is possibly irrelevant. That is the tangle on which we need guidance from the Department. I thought it a matter which should be brought up at an early stage because it is hound to colour our thinking as we work our way through the Bill and deal with other clauses. My question is whether we are asking the 500,000 or 600,000 companies known to the Registrar to comply with all the clauses in this Bill. Some of the clauses would be otiose and unnecessary for the tiny one-man businesses which have chosen to operate as companies, compared with the major enterprises
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0675">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
in the economy. I hope I have said enough to show what it is I expect the Minister to explain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to follow my hon. Friend in these interesting amendments. This matter was discussed in the Chamber during the debate on EEC documents late in the evening of Thursday 17th June when we got into the question of the distinction in continental countries between public and private companies and it was pointed out by several of my hon. Friends, including my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams), that one has the difference between the société anonyme and the société avec responsabilité limité,and in Germany the aktiengesellschaft and the Gesellschaft mit beschränkten Haftung. Both the SRL and the GmbH, being private companies are incorporated in different forms of law from that for the SA or the aktiengesellschaft which are both public companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real importance for the future is that public companies like the SA and the AG will have applicable to them the second directive from the European Commission on the shape and format of company accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a matter for discussion whether the fourth directive will also be applicable only to public companies but it is clear that in this country, ever since the Companies Act 1967, in the form of differentiation between public and private companies we are totally out of step with our continental neighbours. In the light of the number of directives on company law and the shape and format of companies coming forward from the European Community this differentiation—and possibly the Minister agrees—between public and private is something which we shall have to debate in this country. t seems appropriate, as my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington has said, that in proposing these amendments we should start trying to take it on board in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear, and the point was made on Second Reading, that in terms of filing of accounts and requirements of auditors, the requirements on companies are tightened by this Bill. In general terms that is appropriate, but I query whether it is necessary that all these new provisions should apply to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
smaller private company. We therefore have two stands available: the direction in which the EEC is moving, affecting on the one hand public companies and a statutory form of incorporation which gives the private company the appearance of a limited liability company but allows it in fact to act as a partnership; on the other hand, we have the stand that there should be greater disclosure, more regular filing of accounts, as is appropriate to the big public companies with many shareholders, but not to the smaller private companies. On these two stands these amendments are worth looking at in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. I would make the distinction very clear indeed and it would be interesting to hear what the Minister has to say in reply to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should say at the outset that it follows from the distinction in names that there will be distinctions in the duties and requirements on companies, private and public, and we shall be considering the matter carefully, as I indicated. The hon. Gentleman the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton), when he spoke on the draft EEC directives was right. We shall have to consider the situation on its merits in relation to each type of company. We should not get ourselves dug into trenches at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is being negotiated and I do not think that the point being made now is relevant to the context of this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand the position, which was not clearly spelt out in the speech made by the hon. Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) because he said he was probing, I thought he was probably doing so vaguely. His definition of a company for the purposes of this Bill would be so narrow as to exempt the majority of companies from the need even to prepare accounts, and from all the other requirements in the Bill. I can hardly think that he would wish his provisions to have that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Few companies have more than 500 employees, employ capital of over £2 million or have a turnover of over £5 million. The Committee would recognise that it would be retrograde to exempt all companies not fulfilling this—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not clear. The Minister seems to be reading out a passage on another amendment dealing with "public" and "private".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0676">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is wrong. I was looking at Amendments No. 73 and 75.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite right. I am sorry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: t would be a retrograde step which would have the effect of exempting from the requirements of the Bill all companies which do not fall within the definition prepared by the hon. Gentleman in his amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think I should have grouped the amendments in the way which has been decided. Amendment No. 73 is a reprint of the definition included in the Corporate Report, with which the Minister will be familiar. t is so useful that I thought it should be considered by the Committee. The Minister was right to say that my amendment was vague. I cannot say that these three amendments hang together. I cannot pretend that they do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The selection has been made. It was not of my initiative that the situation was changed. As I understand it, the hon. Gentleman wanted it as he has now got it. I have to deal with the situation as the amendments have been selected and I have to deal with the proposals in Amendments No. 73 and 75. I have dealt with Amendment No. 73. Whether it hangs together with the rest of what the hon. Member wanted I am not in a position to arbitrate about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 75 is also unacceptable if we are to consider the proposals of the Bill in a sensible way. It is unacceptable because it would restrict the application of certain parts of the Bill but would make "public" synonymous with "listed" and would cause much confusion. The expression "a public company" has -always been understood as one not brought within the definition of Section 28' of the Act. There are 15,000 public companies, but only about one-fifth are listed on the Stock Exchange. I hope that the hon. Gentleman would not wish to proceed with that proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect, as I have already indicated, of the proposals together, would be to exclude all small companies, presumably because of the burden which would fall upon them, not only from filing their accounts but even from preparing accounts. That would be a ludicrous situation which even A. P. Herbert in his
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
most mischievous moments would not have contemplated. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will understand the absurdity of getting the Committee into that sort of situation. It cannot be that it would wish to obtain that effect in our consideration of the Bill. I believe it would be otiose for me further to develop that argument unless Opposition Members insist upon pursuing the arguments they have adumbrated. I hope that, on reflection, they will consider that they are inappropriate and that what I have said is sufficient to cause the hon. Member for Kensington to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the Committee is faced with a problem. Probably Amendments Nos. I and 75 hang together, while Amendment No. 73 is more accurately related to the question of size. I do not wish to reopen discussion on the relationship of the amendments. I consider it best that we proceed as we have begun. As a result of your kind consideration, Mr. Crawshaw, we shall be able to discuss the question of size in the next set of amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has said that if we accept Amendment No. 1, which seeks to cover public companies, we should find that non-public companies would not be required to produce any accounts, or to have any accounts. That is not my understanding of the position. I may be wrong—this is a highly complex area—but it is my understanding that if we accepted the amendment we should revert to the existing situation. I do not think it is true that small companies would not be required to produce accounts. There is nothing in the clause to suggest that they would not continue as they have always acted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This debate raises the whole question of the purpose of the clause as regards public companies, or other companies, and whether it is desirable to make any change. As I understand it, the concept of an accounting reference period has been imported from the Price Code. The principle of the financial year has somewhat altered. The Minister has not given an explanation why we should change the system in this curious way. It is undoubtedly true that the first 11 clauses of the Bill are interlinked in an unbelievably complex manner. The cross-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0677">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
referencing is especially undesirable when we are starting from scratch on a new system. My first point is whether the Minister was right to say that private companies would not have to prepare accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point relates to the series of questions raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton)—namely, future legislation and the EEC directives. Clearly, it would be foolish to go ahead with this legislation on a basis quite inconsistent with whatever may eventually develop in the EEC. The Minister has not replied to my hon. Friend's questions on that issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In particular, he has not replied on timing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately the hon. Gentleman was not able to attend a fairly long debate that took place on the Floor of the House when these matters were exhaustively covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman wanted to go to bed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These matters were exhaustively dealt with on that occasion. I made two speeches. Surely that was enough for hon. Members on both sides.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friends and I are gluttons for punishment. I read every word of the debate to which the Minister has referred. I thought it was an interesting debate. I was especially interested in the comments of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, East (Sir D. Walker-Smith). I have carefully studied the report of the debate. However, that debate is not relevant to the Bill, except that we need to take into account what was said on that occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should like the Minister to say how he relates that debate to the amendments. We want to know when he envisages making the changes that may be necessary as a result of EEC legislation. There are differing views about whether we should harmonise company legislation. If the Government take the view that we should not harmonise, there is no problem. I hope that the Minister will say a little more about timing. If he takes up that point he might reinforce
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
our view that it is premature to go ahead with this part of the Bill unless it will be a considerable time before any moves take place on the European front.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister was seeking to blind us with science when he said that Section 28 of the Companies Act provides that a public company is not necessarily one that is quoted on the Stock Exchange. He went on to point out that of the many thousands of public companies only relatively few arc quoted on the Stock Exchange. The Minister was arguing that many such companies would fall without my hon. Friend's amendment without having any new legislative prescription applying to them—for example. the filing of accounts and audits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Minister is approaching this problem from quite the wrong way round. As it happens, I have a copy of the Companies Act 1948. Section 28 does not define public companies. In fact, it defines private companies. It points out that a private company is restricted in its right to transfer its shares. The section limits the number of its members to 50 and
	<br><blockquote><p>"prohibits any invitation to the public to subscribe for any shares or debentures of the company."</p></blockquote>
I have looked through the whole of the Act and I believe that there is no definition of a public company within it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A purpose behind the amendment is to establish a situation where we shall have a definition of a public company. At present, I believe that a public company is not a term of art in any shape. We have touched on the wider purpose of the Bill—namely, eventual harmonisation within the EEC. In that context I believe we must arrive at a stage where a public company is defined, where it has a definite legal status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the moment I choose to talk only to Amendment No. 1. I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir 13. Rhys Williams) has intentionally led the Government on to tell us how they see the definition of a public company in future, as opposed to a private proprietorial company in which the share ownership is held by relatively few and in which there is a much narrower responsibility. I believe that to be the purpose behind the amendment. Surely it is encumbent upon the Minister to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0678">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
develop that point in answering my hon. Friend. We have not yet had a definition of a public company, and we need one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that the Minister has not taken advantage of the opportunity that the amendment gives him to make clear the Department's thinking. We believe that we are about to embark on a series of Companies Bills that will probably be at least as important as anything that has been done since the time of Gladstone, yet we find the Department has not even clarified its mind as to the types of companies at which it is aiming this legislation. I hope that before we conclude this debate the Minister will make a plain statement on what he believes to be a major public undertaking and, although it may be defined as a public company, what is really a specialised and small undertaking, and his thinking about private companies, which are not all small or one-man businesses—indeed, some of them are very large. If the Department has not clarified its thinking on these matters, how many more muddles shall we have as we proceed with this tremendous volume of legislation? We are now discussing a Bill that has 35 clauses and three schedules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stick to the original intention of my amendment, which was not purely exploratory, because I wished to draw attention to the fact that probably the majority of the 5,000 or 6,000 companies known to the Registrar probably do not need to respond to every one of the 35 clauses and three schedules. Before we try to proceed further with the Bill we must know whether the Minister is dedicated to forcing every one of those companies to co-operate with the new proposals in the Bill, or whether he is prepared to consider some limitation so that he does not catch every one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made it abundantly plain at the outset of my second or third speech that we intend all companies to be covered by the ambit of these proposals. I do not want there to be any misunderstanding about that. I do not believe that these proposals constitute an inordinately heavy burden for all companies to bear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not complain, but I think that Opposition Members have sought to widen the discussion so as to bring in the EEC. The hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) was especially concerned about the EEC. I thought that I had
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
covered that issue on the Floor of the House, although I appreciate that I can never do so adequately by the standards of the hon. Gentleman. Nothing in the Bill is in any way inconsistent with the EEC directives. There is not a little evidence to suggest the contrary. But the Opposition amendment would be contrary to the EEC directives. Perhaps the first directive goes the furthest, and probably the second directive is the most advanced, but it is unlikely that we shall have to legislate to cover those directives within about two years. That point has been made by the hon. Member for Worthing. He made it at rather greater length than I did on the Floor of the House. He recognises the position perfectly well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the hon. Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) has specific intentions, but it is difficult to deal with his proposals when, by the admission of the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton), they are so vague. I can only interpret how the amendment would affect the provisions of the Bill. As I have indicated, I believe that the amendment would have the most extraordinary effect. I believe it would exclude small companies from the Bill's provisions. That would be extraordinary and thoroughly undesirable. To exclude them on the basis that an additional burden would be imposed upon them does not seem to be a realistic way of viewing the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the view—I say this so that there can be no equivocation—that there is a privilege attaching to limited liability, and a duty, which affects a limited liability company in consideration of having that privilege conferred upon it. The duty is disclosure of its accounts. There are those who are interested in ensuring that accounts are properly prepared and filed. During the lifetime of the Conservative Government, when the move to Cardiff was being undertaken, the fear was expressed that the move might inhibit the objectives of those who are interested in freely investigating accounts. We know that that is not going to be the situation, and I do not want to go on to a debate about Cardiff, but my point illustrates that there is a wide public interest in the accounts of both private and public companies. t would be extraordinary if we prevented that area of disclosure from taking full effect. It might have the effect
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0679">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
of putting the clock back, by implication if not design. It would be ridiculous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is my point about the 	<i>status quo.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to the point about the 	<i>status quo.</i> I must deploy my arguments in the order which I think best rather than the order which the hon. Member for Worthing may prefer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Opposition's concern is related to the requirement to file accounts, I think that it is misconceived. Anxiety was expressed in 1967 when the duty to file accounts was extended to all limited companies. Experience has shown that that anxiety was misplaced. The Bolton Committee did not recommend that the category of exempt private company should be restored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked why the position should not be allowed to continue, subject to the existing requirements. That would be pointless. It would create administrative chaos for the Registrar as he would be obliged to administer two different systems. It would be most difficult to enforce the filing requirements. This goes to the heart of what we seek to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently in the House I referred to some of the problems that were experienced in the filing of accounts. On 7th June my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Molloy) asked me about the filing of returns. I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"79,000 companies have not yet filed an annual return for the calendar year 1974 and the returns of 245,000 companies are outstanding for 1975. They represent 12 per cent. and 38 per cent. respectively of live companies on the register."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 7th June 1976; Vol. 912, c. 898–899.]</p></blockquote>
That is an important matter. This is one of the important features of the Bill. It is designed to mitigate the abuse which is being perpetrated at present. Unless we have these powers we shall not be able to deal with that abuse. I should have thought that hon. Gentlemen would have appreciated the importance of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman sought to say that the proposals of the Government were inconsistent with the EEC directives. I indicated that that was an inaccurate summation of the position. The hon. Gentleman's proposals would be inconsistent, as the first directive on company law, which we accepted on accession to
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
the Common Market, requires all companies with limited liability to file accounts. The hon. Gentleman looks sceptical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sceptical about that. The Minister has not yet dealt with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) that if private limited liability companies were excluded from the Bill the present 	<i>status quo</i> would remain. They would have to file their accounts. That duty would remain on them. However, the new time limit and period imposed on them under the Bill would not prevail. The existing law, under which there is an obligation to identify accounts, would prevail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may plead with the hon. Gentleman to listen. However, I cannot make him listen. Clearly he has chosen not to listen. I dealt with the point made by the hon. Member for Worthing. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman was distracted by the hon. Member for Kensington. I do not know. I said that two systems would operate, thus creating a heavy administration burden for the Registrar. It would render manifestly more difficult the task of dealing with the abuse of the late filing of returns, to which these clauses are directed. That abuse is plain. It requires urgent attention. If we are denied those powers, or if the situation were made much more cumbrous as a result of the hon. Gentleman's proposals, the abuse will persist. That is wholly undesirable. I should have thought that my proposal would have met with the approval of both sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If neither the EEC directive point nor my other points are found compelling, perhaps I may mention one point which the Opposition may find entrancing. I refer to proposals put forward by the Opposition. These new proposals are contrary to their policy, as stated in 1973 by the Working Party on Company Law Reform, and their Bill. Surely the Opposition find that argument utterly irresistible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Minister has yet dealt with the EEC point. I should be grateful if he would do so. He referred to the first directive. However, he did not deal with the second directive. Speaking recently in the House
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0680">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
of Commons about the second directive, the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Notably, it has now been accepted) by the Commission and the other members of the Community that the directive should apply in the United Kingdom only to public companies." —[	<i>Official Report,</i> 17th June 1976; Vol. 913, C. S86–7.]</p></blockquote>
I support my hon. Friend's amendment to enlarge and define that point. The Minister said that no fewer than two years would be required to bring the changed definition into operation after its adoption. We say that if it must be done within two years, or at the most three—as the second directive is now expected to become company law within 12 months—why not do it now? Why not try to incorporate it at the first stage in the existing Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's point is Misconceived. The provisions in this Bill are in no way inconsistent with the requirements of the EEC directive. They are required in any event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to whether a distinction should be drawn, we were successful in persuading our colleagues in the EEC to accept the points about public companies to which I referred. I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Public companies have been selected because they are most closely analogous to companies in the other member States to which the directive will apply."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 17th June 1976; Vol. 913, c. 887.]</p></blockquote>
This has no relevance to the specific area of company law to which we are now directing our attention. It does not apply to whether a distinction is to be drawn in relation to the directives. The Committee will realise that we are still involved in the debate in the EEC. I cannot do more than I indicated on 17th June when we debated the matter. This is a continuing process. We must look at the position carefully. I cannot enter into a position about it in advance of any determination of the position on the EEC front. The proposals that we have set out here will be required in any event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of disclosure, small companies, in some material respects, may be placed in a different position from the others. We must consider, for example, the case of the non-profit-making companies. That idea was canvassed in 1973 and discarded by the then Government. That matter should be the subject
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
of further investigation. I do not wish to enter into a commitment at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the basic issue of information which is required on disclosure of administrative matters and the company's financial position. The profit and loss account is essential for disclosure. It is part of the price that a company pays for the privilege of being a limited liability company. It is not too high a price, to pay. The burdens are not onerous. I fit* it surprising that the Opposition should consider that the burdens are so heavy that they should' not borne by the smaller companies. Therefore I hope that we may now move on to other areas of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Shersby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said he did not think that these proposals Would impose an inordinately heavy burden on the smaller companies. I have 300 small companies in my constituency, Uxbridge. Those companies constantly complain of the heavy burden which they must bear. I refer to the heavy burden of giving effect to the mass of legislation that has poured from the House in recent years. For example, they must deal with the problems of the Equal Pay (No.,2) Act, the Sex Discrimination Act, the Employment Protection Act, the Health and Safety at Work etc Act. The Dock Work Regulation Bill is still before the House. As a result extra staff must be employed in company secretaries' offices. t has placed a substantial burden on small companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will say whether he feels that small companies should be excluded from the provision of basic information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shersby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The smaller private company should be looked at differently from the large public company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the interesting points to have come out of this debate is that Members have expressed their opinion that, as we are considering yet another Bill, perhaps the time has come when we should look at categories of companies rather than treat them all the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that limited liability companies had privileges and duties. I accept that they have duties. However, it is possible that if we go on much longer in this way the price that they, must pay for those privileges will be high. It would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0681">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
be helpful if, as a result of this meeting, more thought could be given in the Department to the need for a distinction to be drawn between large and small, and private and public, companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps there is a need for two separate systems. The Minister said that the Bill would not mitigate the abuse—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I referred to the amendments—not the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shersby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that the Bill, if it is enacted in its present form, will bog down the company secretarys' offices in many small manufacturing companies. They will feel that they are being encompassed in yet another web of legislation and regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The burden on the company Registrar might be less than that on small manufacturing companies. The Registrar, with all the modern facilities available to him, might be in a very much better position than the small private company to deal with the sort of proposals in the Bill. The EEC directive should apply only to public companies. It would be wise for us to consider whether a new form of categorisation could be reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear the Minister say that there would be further investigation of non-profit-making companies. They are to be treated differently. That kind of thinking could be pursued with profit and advantage by the Department of Trade, if not in this Bill, then in future legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is extraordinary that, in the Government's mind, the half million companies in this country are as alike as peas in a pod. There are substantial differences which require different treatment.' That is why I welcome the probing amendment which initiated this useful debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was correct when he said that there was a wide public interest in company accounts. Much of it comes from foreign companies which are in competition with our own firms. The bargaining and price-setting position of a one-product company would be revealed in the publication of its accounts. A foreign competitor could judge how to undercut a British firm in order to drive it out of business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The procedure of which the hon. Gentleman is complaining is an existing requirement. Is he suggesting that this should be cut back and that we should pull down the curtain on certain companies because their accounts might be probed by mysterious foreign spies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should not think of all foreign firms as mysterious spies, but some are interested in what goes on in our firms, so that they can compete more favourably and take markets from us. The situation I have outlined is a realistic one for some firms. It may be deliberate self-protection, rather than idleness, which prevents some companies from sending their figures to the Ministry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that powers were required to deal 'with abuses. That is correct, in so far as abuses exist, but surely the main purpose of having information about a company is to gauge whether it is able to to meet its debts and pay its way. Who would look upon a small company's accounts in the registry? The normal procedure is to seek a reference from a banker or another tradesman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also said that it might impose too great a burden on the Registrar if there were more than one way of dealing with this matter. If there were a substantial number of exemptions from the obligations which the Minister wants to impose on companies, the Registrar would have less to do. Why impose an increasing amount of paper work on everyone unnecessarily?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome what the Minister said about considering the position of non-profit-making small companies, but what has the profit-making element to do with it? Accounts are submitted for tax purposes. Why not make the exemption as wide as possible?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not let us into his thinking on harmonisation. He said that the position in the Bill would, not be inconsistent with harmonisation when that comes forward, but that is a very negative view. The Government should be promoting harmonisation in Europe. The amendment gives the Minister an opportunity of presenting some ideas today, but he has told us nothing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is archaic that the Bill includes no definition of a public company except a negative definition—that it is not something else. How does the Minister propose
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0682">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
to change that definition so that the Europeans can understand it? Why leave it to them to go into negative definitions which, to their logical minds, would appear even more bewildering than they appear to us?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said it would be putting too much work on the Registrar to have two systems for the registration of companies. That is a mistaken attitude. We have to treat small and one-man businesses differently from major undertakings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that there must have been a feeling in the Registrar's office that it would be a good thing if the Bill resulted in the collapse of tens or hundreds of thousands of the small companies which the Registrar has to record. I suspect that the words "and cause to be printed" were included to make very small companies reflect whether it was worth having company status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that limited liability includes important concessions which must not be abused. No doubt there are utterly incompetent and fraudulent small businesses, but the majority do not deliberately seek to withhold information from the Registrar. They are simply collapsing under the burden of paper work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the intolerable requirement that reports should be printed is to be withdawn under the next amendment, we shall find a number of places in the Bill where what is good for medium and large businesses does not have to be extended to the smallest companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Amendments No. 1 and 75, I draw attention to the differences between companies offering shares to the public and those where the shares are held by people who are presumably in a very much better position to observe closely what goes on in a firm. Amendment No. 73 is an indication that some large private companies need to be caught by the same legislation that we prepare for public companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly the Minister is not going to budge. He wants every clause to apply to every company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Neubert</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that the Government have given support to a comparable position in which companies are categorised as class 1, 2 or 3 under the Price Code?
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
They are defined by turnover, so there is some acceptance that companies can differ in their needs and in the requirements made of them. This may not be as fundamental a matter as the filing of annual accounts, but it recognises the different situation of companies of different sizes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. That is another example of the Government recognising that there has to be more than one system of company law.

	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
Amendment No. 84 is the substantive amendment in this group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no difference between the Under-Secretary and myself on the need to ensure that companies present their reports at the appropriate time. From my experience at the Treasury I know how onerous it is to try to get companies, particularly small companies, to produce their accounts on time. It is obviously desirable that they should do so and I welcome any change which would achieve this—provided it is not unduly onerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of these amendments is to deal with dormant companies who have not been trading in any given period and, therefore, have no change in their financial situations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the cases in which officials have to chase companies which have not filed their accounts arise when it is difficult to find companies' offices because companies have moved or the people running them are difficult to-trace. There are many of these cases, and it would be onerous for companies in this category. which are, in effect, dormant, to be required to produce accounts for every year, even when there has been virtually no change in their circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would reduce the burden on the Registrar and those who own dormant companies. The amendments are simple and straightforward and I do not think I need to expand on the main provisions of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to speak to Amendment No. 10 which is linked with Amendment 84 and geared to provide the same objective as has just been outlined. In a situation where companies, for whatever reason, are winding down or becoming semi-defunct there is a great danger of the records, which are being placed, lapsing, and of no records appearing for scrutiny. The danger is that if there is a requirement for companies to give more detail the burden of preparing those details for a company becoming dormant or semi-dormant is sufficient for it to do nothing at all. It is beneficial for the public that there should be a statement saying that there have been no transactions and that this should be done as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Amendment No. 84 a two-year period is allowed. My suspicion is that in
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
the first of those two years when a company has no transactions there may be an inertia against preparing the necessary paper work. Therefore, in that there are no records at all appearing people do not know what the situation is. It is more desirable to have a statement saying that no transaction has taken place, than just a vacuum in the records.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not press this amendment, but if the Minister is looking at wording perhaps he would consider the desirability of having an early response to the situation, rather than after two years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The exemption proposed in the amendment would contravene the EEC first directive. This was something we accepted on accession to the Community, one of the penalties, that companies must file their accounts every year, and there is no provision for any exemptions. Whether hon. Members feel that it is a satisfactory or unsatisfactory state of affairs is a matter over which we have no control. We would be breaching our obligations if we were to accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirement to file accounts, even though the company has not traded during the period in question, and even where the company has no liabilities, is not an unduly onerous one. I know this point is one to which hon. Members took exception in the previous debate, but the burden which is imposed by the Bill, whether on these companies or small companies, is not a heavy one. If anything, it assists, because already companies have to prepare, lay and file accounts. The new provisions will clarify and simplify the existing somewhat confused requirements. They will not involve them in more paper work. Clarification of the position is something which must be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding the sort of company with which this amendment is concerned, the simple solution where the company is defunct, and not expected to undertake business again, is simply to get it removed from the register. What we have embarked on, not only in this Bill, but by substantially increasing the fee on the annual return, which I know caused hon. Members opposite a great deal of consternation—I think incorrectly—is a two-pronged attack on the moribund company. There can be no advantage in cluttering up the register. with these companies; that would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0684">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
have no advantage for the community, or those responsible for maintaining an efficient register, and it would be of no particular advantage, either, to those who are not seeking to trade with these companies in the future. The amendment is to some extent misconceived. I note the hon. Gentleman gave some indication that he would be withdrawing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We understand the point the Minister made about the first directive. t would be unfortunate if members of the Community were to take the view, because a particular directive had been approved by members of the Community, whether or not it was in force at the time when a particular member joined, that that directive should be immutable for all time. That does not follow. As the years go on we shall need to look at the provisions of various directives to see whether they require amendment. While I accept the technical point the Minister has made I do not accept the strategic point. It would be unfortunate if we were to feel that these were carved in tablets of stone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the second point, whether we could not remove the burden from the companies and officials concerned, if we could produce some suitable statement which meets the official requirements there would be fewer people employed chasing up dormant companies, as well as a saving of time for the companies concerned. What we have in mind are dormant not dead companies. The Minister is obviously carrying out a purge against dormant companies. We can understand his reasons for that. None the less, there are some companies which may be dormant but which the owners may eventually wish to resuscitate, and it may be convenient to have a number of dormant companies which may be used for some purpose within the scope of their operations but which, none the less, at the moment are not being used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am far from clear whether it would be desirable to wipe out all these dormant companies, which might be a useful vehicle for the larger companies which own them. We wish to consider the point whether there should be for such companies some simplified form of accounts and obligations, which, consistent with the first directive, would enable the burden at the moment falling on those responsible for such companies to be reduced. In view of what the
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
Minister and the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) said, I would not wish to press the amendment, but I would give careful consideration to the arguments put forward to see whether we can meet the same point at Report stage, if we ever get to Report stage.

We ran into problems because we agreed there were three separate areas and it was difficult to take down precisely which amendments were being grouped. It was the problem of taking down at speed in a moment the change in selection,. a change which was entirely justified in itself. We understand the point you have made.

This is a simple and uncontentious set of amendments, which arc being proposed in order to meet the criticisms by various organisations and hon. Members on both sides that the requirement that accounts should be printed is unnecessary and unduly onerous, especially in the case of small companies. The purpose of the requirement in the Bill is to ensure that the accounts are legible, durable and in a lasting form. I am sure that few hon. Members will disagree with these aims. Accounts which are not legible and rapidly disintegrate are irritating to users and considerably hinder the work of the Registrar. The Government had already made clear that the requirement would be interpreted liberally and that accounts would be accepted for filing even if they were not, strictly speaking, printed, provided they were in a suitable form. Nevertheless there has continued to be some concern about the requirement, and the Government have decided to delete from the Bill the requirement to print accounts and, instead, to use the powers in Clause 25 to prescribe requirements as to the detailed form in which accounts can be submitted. These requirements will be published and companies will be shown exactly what will be suitable. It is the Government's intention to allow typescript and good quality photocopies for any companies which are in difficulty in preparing accounts in a suitable form. I hope this meets the amendments tabled by the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a point we raised on Second Reading and we have received a number of representations, particularly from small companies, expressing concern about the need to have accounts printed. One of my hon. Friends had a parliamentary Question down yesterday on precisely what the cost would be. There is general agreement on both sides that it was a mistake to put in this requirement in the first place and I was expecting to stand up to say what a good thing it was that the Government had seen the wisdom of our suggestions and that we were grateful.

Alas, the Minister's speech has put me off that reaction, because what he has suggested is that they should knock out "cause to be printed" and proceed to regulate the matter, perhaps in many details, by statutory instrument.-We would much prefer to have "reproduced in legible form". That would meet the point—and the Minister seemed to be agreeing. Let us not have more statutory instruments as the House has inadequate time to debate them and is quite unable to amend them. I hope that the Minister can accept that our expression is right and that there is no need to have regulations to cover the point. I hope we shall get a favourable response from the Minister. Otherwise I should advise my hon. Friends to vote against the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that what I said put the hon. Member off. I hoped that it might have been helpful. I appreciate his concern. All of us in our time have attacked the propensity of Governments to introduce regulations. I have certainly done so, and probably every member of the Committee has done so at some stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member's amendment to introduce "reproduced in legible form" is much too vague and would lead to endless argument and dispute. While I understand his abhorrence—"dislike" would, perhaps, be a better word—of regulations, without wishing to be unhelpful I must say that the Government regard this as quite the best

way to meet the matter and while I should like to meet him on this matter I cannot accept his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: if the words in the Conservative Amendment No. 83 are not acceptable would the Minister say whether the words in Amendment No. 4 in my name would be acceptable from the technical point of view?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shersby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In this Room only a few days ago we had an agreeable debate on the Stock Exchange (Completion of 'Bargains) Bill. Part of that Bill related to the production of documents in non-legible form. Surely if one can handle a description of that kind in that way one can also handle it in terms of documents being produced in a legible form. So there does not seem to be any overriding objection from the statutory point of view to the use of that expression.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While we welcome the deletion of "cause to be printed" which has given so much offence to many small business men, it would be welcome if we could see the precise wording. Will the Government bring forward their own amendment to give the precise wording so that we do not have to have a regulation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to give an assurance to the Committee that I appreciate the concern about regulations, but I can also give the assurance that the regulations will be the minimum necessary to ensure that accounts are in a form which is durable and legible. I cannot go further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to what the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) said and his Amendment No. 4, I am advised that his words do not deal with the original, and that the accounts could be in manuscript. That may not be what he has in mind, but it would not cover the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also further advised that if the wording is included in the Bill—I cannot read the writing on this paper—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not in legible form.—(	<i>Laughter.</i>)</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point. It is manuscript, which illustrates the difficulty straight away. I apologise. t is a technical point. I shall start again and read this mimeograph, a word the hon. Member
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) has used in his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If his wording were in the Bill we would be stuck with all those details, and there would, therefore, be no scope for allowing for future developments in reproduction, even if they were fully acceptable. I hope that meets the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not trying to be unhelpful, but the Government take the view that regulations would cover the point, and I do not think that small companies would be unnecessarily burdened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister undertake to bring forward an amendment on Report to clear this up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One must say to the Minister—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not know whether the Minister had finished his speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to interrupt a reply to the hon. Member's point. His wording puts us in a difficulty. We have put forward an amendment which we find entirely sensible. Perhaps the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) would concede that there are problems with No. 4. I should not prefer that to Amendment 83 which my hon. Friends and he proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Governments have more and more resorted to statutory instruments to introduce this sort of regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concern in small businesses is precisely because the Government thoughtlessly put in a phrase like "must be printed" without considering the effect on small companies. Regulations have a low chance of being debated and cannot be amended. They may have a damaging effect on business, particularly small businesses. I realise that the Under-Secretary appreciates that the point is sensitive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That being so, it would be sensible to accept our amendment. If the argument is that our wording is not sufficiently appropriate and the Government wish to use another form, we understand, and in that case it would be sensible for the Government to look at it between now and Report—if we ever get to Report—and write in the right expression. There is no need to have powers to alter by regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0687">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
The Minister will say that further legislation would be necessary, if it were necessary to change the words, but he keeps on saying that there will be further legislation on this, that or the other aspect of company law, so that there would be bags of opportunity to change this again if the difficulties were found to be insuperable. There is no need to deal with it by regulation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point put by my hon. Friend was that if new processes not defined by primary legislation were introduced and they were found to be beneficial, cutting them out would then be found to have been undesirable. To have a situation of undue rigidity, or, on the other hand, a position which would create uncertainty in definition and lead, as my hon. Friend put it, to endless difficulties—are these not things which we want to avoid? All my hon. Friend has been putting, rightly, is that regulations will provide for a greater degree of continuing flexibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that were so and the Minister believed it he would have put it in the Bill in the first place, but he did not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We view with suspicion further regulations, especially if they affect small businesses. We want this looked at between now and Report. We do not accept the Government's argument. If there is a massive technological breakthrough it would be surprising if the Government could not devise a form of words without the need for regulations. We cannot have this sudden change of position by the Government, refusing to budge at all, so I hope the Minister can say that he will look at the matter again between now and Report to find a suitable form of words, and not resort to regulation. I hope he will give that undertaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If not, we must vote for our Amendment No. 83 and I think that that will necessarily mean that we must vote against Amendment No. 2. To avoid a string of votes we shall look at the first vote and allow the second to go the way that that does, but I hope the Minister will avoid it all by saying that he will look at the matter again and find a form of words other than the use of a statutory instrument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be difficult and unhelpful. It is clear that hon. Members who have spoken feel strongly on this point. It is the intention of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
Government, before making regulations, to consult the Registrar's users' group, but that will not satisfy the Opposition. I shall look into it again, but while I say that, I do not want to mislead the Committee by saying that there will be a commitment to put another form of words into the Bill. I shall look at it to see whether the words are suitable, but my present thinking is that this an administration point and exactly the right sort suitable for regulation and is much too detailed for primary legislation. However, I shall look at it between now and Report to see whether something can be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister does not seem to appreciate that many small people and small firms would rather have certainty and knowledge about their obligations, than uncertainty for a long period of time. It may be that they wish to buy a new machine to print their own accounts. It may be that they employ a clerk who has perfect lettering and wonder whether that will satisfy a particular regulation or rule that is to be brought forward. They want to know their obligations and not to have uncertainty hanging over their heads about forthcoming regulations—yet others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Small companies also like to operate within a fair degree of flexibility, I am sure the hon. Gentleman will agree. However, I have said I will look at it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also have listened and then given undertakings and I cannot accept that one. The Government have changed their position, but it is not a satisfactory change. If, without commitment, they are going to look at it before Report to have the right form of words, we should reword the phrase now to have the right form of words and take it from there. Unless the Government make clear that they will abandon the regulation approach I must ask my hon. Friends to divide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is resiling from his own position. He did not seek to impose that condition when he last addressed the Committee. He was then asking "Will the Government take it away and think about it?" My hon. Friend has precisely complied with his suggestion, but once he has done so the hon. Member seeks to resile. I find it inexplicable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may seek to explain. Clearly, this is a point of principle. The Government say that they will consider the matter between now and Report. If they are prepared to find a satisfactory form of words, fair enough, but we must be clear that they will not remain in the position of saying "We have thought about it and we think it must be done by regulation". That is something we cannot accept. If the Government are prepared to look at the matter again, without any question of regulation, we shall accept that position. However, if it is their present view that they cannot give a commitment not to proceed by way of regulation, that is not acceptable to us. Their view is not acceptable to business generally, which is fed up with government by regulation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The selection of Amendment No. 6 and all the consequential and associated amendments enables me to develop a theme that I have often sought to expand upon by presenting my own Private Member's Companies Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has disappointed me that time and again over the years the Department has sent instructions to the Government Whips to ensure that my Bill was blocked and did not have a Second Reading. Surely it would have been better to have allowed hon. Members who are seriously interested in company law reform to have a morning or two in Committee to discuss certain major aspects of company law rather than to have ensured that Parliament had to be silent at a time when the public were becoming increasingly concerned about the health of the British joint stock company. At all events, we now have presented to us by the Government an opportunity of considering how the future supervisory function is carried out in the joint stock company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to waste a lot of time with preliminaries, but perhaps I should explain some of the background of my thinking so that the reasons for tabling some of these extremely detailed amendments become clear. My first amendment, which you were kind enough to select, Mr. Crawshaw, did not attempt to go into detail. Perhaps the rather squalid debate that we had in consequence might have been avoided if I had tried to put forward more minutely my specific recommendations. I hope that I shall not be criticised for having tried to be minutely specific in this group of amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
I have great confidence in British management and British work people. I spent some 20 years working in joint stock companies before I had the good fortune to be elected. I have had an unusually wide experience of large and small companies. That was especially so during some years in management consultancy. I am sure that there is nothing wrong with our management or work people by comparison with those of others, perhaps more successful mixed economies, on the Continent and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is something badly wrong with the way in which they are organised. The trouble is that Parliament has allowed the state of our company law to decay. We require people at work to organise themselves in such a way that they do not always produce of their best. It is not sufficient for Members of Parliament or official spokesmen to inveigh against the private sector, to grumble about the policies of management or to grumble about work people, without saying how they think the situation should be improved. Parliament needs to diagnose what is wrong with the British version of the joint stock company. It needs to analyse why it does not perform as well in this country as in other similar countries, and to do something about it without any more delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot afford to talk about company law reform as a project extending over many years into the future. Given the present state of the economy, Parliament is not permitted to dawdle on the way to company law reform. If we consider the different models of the joint stock company that operate successfully on the Continent, in North America and elsewhere, we have much to learn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, while we do not want to dawdle, it is right that the Government have set up a committee, headed by Lord Bullock, to investigate wider aspects of company law reform than those to which he has specifically alluded? Does he not think that we should await the result of that high-powered committee's deliberations? Does he not think it folly to talk about company law reform along the lines he has suggested within the scope of the current Session? Fourthly and finally, does he agree that the points he is making were not in any shape or form taken up by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
1973 Companies Bill, which was the major piece of reform the Conservative Government were seeking to introduce?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously I should have liked the 1973 Bill to have gone further than it did. However, it made a start in the direction of recognising, for instance, what I know is in the mind of the Under-Secretary of State, namely, the responsibility of boards to employees. One of the new clauses which I have ventured to put on the Paper revives a concept that was to be found in the 1973 Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the appointment of the Bullock Committee, I do not think that Parliament should allow itself to be closed up by the manoeuvre of a Department in setting up a committee or a Royal Commission. When there is an urgent problem to be dealt with Members of Parliament owe it to the country to get on with it, even if a high-powered committee has been set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister has studied my amendments, as I hope he has, I am sure he will agree that I have kept away from the area of responsibility of the Bullock Committee, which is deeply concerned with the whole question of worker participation and procedures of consultation in the process of creating wealth. Those are two of the exciting things that Parliament has ahead of it. I shall be one of those who will be the first to study and, I hope, endorse the findings of the Bullock Committee. However, there is so much else in company law which has to be done, and which can be seen to be of a preparatory character, and which in no way conflicts with what the Bullock Committee may be doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clauses and the amendments relate to matters which the Minister has admitted are outside the scope of the terms of reference of the Bullock Committee. Only a few weeks ago I asked whether the Department would extend the terms of reference of the committee to take in questions of supervision and management. The answer was "No". I was not necessarily disappointed at that answer. I think that we should not ask the Bullock Committee to do too much, especially if we expect a report this year—as, I understand, is the expectation of the Department. If that committee is not to deal with questions of audit and supervision, and if Parliament has before it a Bill which deals with that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0692">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
area, I do not think that it is wrong for this Committee to take the point seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a serious weakness in British company law. The supervisory elements in the joint stock company do not have enough strength. Therefore, the curative function which should be carried out within the joint stock company at the start of its troubles, if it is going into a bad patch, is often largely ineffective. We find that companies allow problems to become worse over a period of years before recognising that they have serious problems. When the shareholders, the public, the Government or management recognise that there is a grave problem to be tackled, all too often it is too late. As a result there are dreadful disclosures in the newspapers and shocks for the economy when companies suddenly collapse like a tree which has rotted from the inside but given no sign on the outside that it is losing health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If by means of a minor amendment to company law we may strengthen the curative role of the officials who already exist within the joint stock company, we shall have done much for the health of the mixed economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading I complained that the Bill had two significant flaws. That was why I was against it. It perpetuates the idea that the accounting data produced by a company should be founded on a narrow, historic basis, whereas I think that the information produced by larger companies should be wider and more forward looking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second weakness of the Bill is that it restricts the auditors' role, making the function of the auditor of an even more restrictive professional character when it should be expanding into a thoroughgoing supervisory service for the shareholders and employees, who also have a stake in the health of the joint stock company. I like the expression "stakeholders" which is being increasingly used in place of the expression "shareholders". It recognises how many people are concerned with the health of the joint stock companies besides those whose money has been put into firms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to learn from foreign countries about the ways in which we may strengthen the supervisory elements we must take note of the German system of operating
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
two-tier boards. Although it is a relatively recent fashion in this country among company law reformers, it is attracting a great deal of attention in all parts of the House and outside and from partners. But we cannot jump straight into the use of two-tier boards from one year to the next. I am convinced of the inevitability of gradualness. I do not believe that we have a sufficiently clear etiquette for the functioning of two-tier boards to be able to introduce them by means of legislation with any reasonable hope of success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the series of Companies' Bills that I have sought to introduce in the past I have tried to give more strength to the non-executive directors who are, in an embyronic form, the supervisory boards of the future. At present, although most large companies have non-executive directors, they are not given enough standing or authority to exert themselves when they see that something is going wrong. A non-executive director who is upset about something that is happening may resign—which is probably a too drastic step if he attracts attention to his resignation, and a futile step if he does not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He may raise his point with the board, the managing director or the chairman of the company, but he will probably find himself in the minority. The reason why it is difficult to find strong and businesslike characters to accept the posts of non-executive directors is that the function that they are able to carry out in all too many companies is too weak and indecisive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the non-executive directors there is in British law a supervisory element in the form of the auditor. Many people are amazed to discover that it was only with the passing of the 1948 Act that it became necessary for auditors to be qualified. The profession of auditing, which has been brought to a fine pitch of expertise, is of relatively recent growth. We need to add to the auditors and the non-executive directors something which will slowly take the shape of a supervisory board. I suggest that the non-executive directors and auditors should work together. That is a far more fruitful way of enabling the supervisory elements to become more effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In drafting the amendments I owed a great deal to the Institute of Internal Auditors, which provided me with a considerable volume of detailed and help-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0693">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
ful information about the way in which the audit committees operate in North America, and especially in Ontario. About 10 years ago pioneering legislation was introduced into Ontario. I think it should be studied closely by the Department. That legislation has been so successful that it is being copied in other Canadian Provinces. It forms the basis of the practice in the United States.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the practice of requiring large companies to set up sub-committees of non-executive directors, that is to say subcommittees of the boards consisting of non-executive directors—with the special function of collaborating with the auditors in looking at the health of the company and bringing to the attention of the board points about which the auditors feel uneasy. By that means we are strengthening the supervisory function, but we are not doing so by setting up an upper tier. We are using a sub-committee of the existing board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that it matters whether the supervisory function is exercised by an upper board on the German pattern or by a sub-committee of a unitary board in the way which has been so successful in North America. It is all-important that the supervisory function should be carried out effectively and that the people who engage in it should be able to make their voices heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to be able to make our voice heard in the event of a dispute, it is necessary to refer to an authority outside the board room. The natural authority is the shareholders gathered at a general meeting. I have learnt a good deal from the reactions of directors of companies to the proposals that I included in my Companies' Bill. I proposed that the non-executive directors should be obliged to make a return to the shareholders, stating, in very much the same way as auditors, whether they have confidence in the management. That is to some, evidently, a frightening proposal. Many highly competent people with significant experience of the way in which joint stock companies operate are afraid of what might happen if non-executive directors were required to set themselves up as a board within a board, although still sitting round the same table as the executive directors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the proposals in new Clause 1 I suggest that the audit committee should
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
report to the board and not to the shareholders. The vestige which remains of my original proposal that supervisory elements should report directly to the shareholders is a much weaker version, to the effect that the audit directors should state whether they consider that the board has given due consideration to their findings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is plenty of room for debate as to the way in which an audit committee might function and the way in which it should report to the board and the shareholders. My formula offers a working basis for discussion. I hope that it will provoke interest among the Committee as to ways in which we should gradually move towards the fully-grown two-tier board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to my modified recommendation about the way in which audit directors should behave. It may be said that "audit director" is just another name for non-executive directors. It is more than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with great interest to what my hon. Friend has said. It seems to me that in the context which he mentioned, New Clause 3 precludes an audit director from performing any extra function on behalf of the company of which he is an audit director. That will raise considerable problems, given the limitations which are frequently imposed on directors' fees. If the individual concerned is to carry out the onerous tasks of an audit director, but no other functions, I should have thought the present level of fees inadequate. I am not sure whether my hon. Friend would care to comment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My comment may take us past 1 o'clock. I recognise the kinds of people who will be able to undertake the role of audit directors. They must be men of stature and experience. They may demand to be paid for their services on a more generous scale than that on which non-executive directors are normally paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw attention to one of my voluminous amendments, in which I suggest that the remuneration of the audit directors should be decided by the members at each annual general meeting of the company. That point appears in Amendment No. 40, the last four lines of which read:
	<br><blockquote><p>(5) The remuneration to be paid to an audit director shall be decided by the members at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0694">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
each annual general meeting of the company and shall be at the discretion of the members, notwithstanding any provisions in the articles of the company governing the remuneration of directors".</p></blockquote>
I have spelled that out as I think that the shareholders need to recognise that they are appointing men who will provide them with an important service. It is right that they should consider the audit directors' fees in the same way as the remuneration of the auditors proper. I
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
have also suggested that they should be able to override the company articles. In many companies the directors' fees tend to be embodied in the conditions, in which no note is taken of inflation or of increased responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
