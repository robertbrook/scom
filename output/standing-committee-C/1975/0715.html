	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>COMPANIES (No. 2) BILL [LORDS]</h1></div>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 12</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>ACCOUNTING RECORDS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Shersby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Committee adjourned on Tuesday, I was moving Amendment. No. 33,in page 15 line 8, leave out paragraph (a), with which we were discussing Amendments Nos. 82,in page 15, line 10, after " sold ", insert " for cash ", and 106, in page 16, line 18, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(11) For the purposes of this Act, the words ' stock ' and ' stocktaking ' shall be understood to include work in progress".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of Amendment No. 33 is to delete the requirement that every business transaction involving a buyer and seller be recorded in sufficient detail to enable the goods and the buyers and sellers to be identified. I wonder what conceivable relevance such a detailed record can have to anyone outside the business transactions involved. What will be the effect on the personal liberty of individuals if this clause is enacted in its present form? Under sub-section (3)(a) it would be possible for purchasers of potentially embarrassing goods bought other than by ordinary retail trade to be identified. I find this a strange and somewhat sinister concept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are we being asked to enact a clause which would compel companies to disclose the names and addresses of customers and the nature of goods they purchase? I should be interested if the Under-Secretary would tell the Committee what on earth this information is required for and how it will be used, and, furthermore, what degree of confidentiality will be attached to it? Will it he available to the police or to the courts? What protection is there for buyers and sellers of goods that their private transactions will not be disclosed for all to see?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Problems of definition also abound and will cause confusion and dismay amongst already harassed small business-
	<span class='label label-info column'>262</span>
men. For example, does every pub inspected once a month constitute stocktaking? Presumably it does. Is every time a grocer inspects and records his cigarette stock a stocktaking? Then there is the definition of " ordinary retail trade". Presumably this means goods sold over the counter. Is that correct? It is not clear from the clause, and that aspect should be clarified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (9) which relates to penalties is really sinister. We find that the penalties for failing to comply with these provisions include imprisonment for up to two years or a fine, or both. Are we going to see the hard-pressed publican who does not comply with the rigour of this clause sent to prison or fined? or both? Will the small grocer be in a similar position?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a duty on every hon. Member to consider whether he wishes to subject companies and their directors to the inquisitorial powers contained in sub-section (3)(a), and, if they fail to comply with them, have them sent to prison for two years for good measure. Of all the clauses in the Bill that I find distasteful, this one is the worst.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Under-Secretary will give us very good reasons why this information is required, the purpose to which it will be put, whether it is confidential, and whether any estimate has been made of the increased costs which will result from the enactment of this clause to those people who are obliged to provide information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Law Officers' Dept (Mr. Arthur Davidson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being unnecessarily and, for him, uncharacteristically alarmist. He normally speaks in mild and considered terms. It may well be that he has misunderstood the intention behind the clause. He has not spoken to Amendments Nos. 82 and 106. I do not know whether he wants me to deal with those as well because they are obviously closely linked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shersby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, if Amendment No. 33 were to be accepted companies would not be subject to several very important requirements relating to accounting records, most of which are incidentally already requirements under the 1948
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0810">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>263</span>
Act. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman is wrong in suggesting—if he sought to suggest—that this legislation would bring in new draconian penalties and new far-reaching requirements. That is not the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3)(a) requires companies whose business involves dealing in goods to keep statements of all stocktakings and all goods sold and purchased, showing details of buyers and sellers. There is an exception with regard to retail trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that statements of goods sold and purchased are the most fundamental aspect of any company's accounting records. Failure to record these is an offence punishable by imprisonment under Section 331 of the 1948 Act, which this clause supersedes. Therefore, to delete para (	<i>a</i>)would be a retrograde step. I am advised that none of the professional bodies which has commented on the Bill has recommended doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Statements of stocktakings are also an essential part of a company's accounting records. The requirements to keep such statements is not new, but the opportunity has been taken in this Bill to bring it up to date and into line with modern practice. Section 331 requires statements of " the annual stock-takings " to be kept. However, nowadays many companies stocktake on a continuing basis and do not undertake formal annual stocktaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary referred to Section 331 of the 1948 Act. I presume he means particularly paragraph 2 of Section 331. This paragraph defines proper accounts ina negative way. It says that there is a liability in the event of proper books of accounts not having been kept, and goes on to define when proper books of accounts have not been kept. The significant detail between Section 331(2) and subsection 3(a) is that Section 331(2) refers to sufficient detail of all cash received and cash paid, and therefore implies that provided that sufficient detail is kept that is adequate. It does not say that every detail has to be kept. The difference here is that an account is needed of all sums of money received and expended by a company. Subsection (3)(a) is very much more inclusive than the
	<span class='label label-info column'>264</span>
greater generality described in the 1948 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will find that as I develop the argument I shall come to that point, because it has to be read in conjunction with Clause 12(1) which provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every company shall cause to be kept accounting records sufficient to give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs and to show and explain its transactions."</p></blockquote>
That is the overriding proviso in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many companies nowadays do their stocktaking on a continuous basis and do not undertake a formal annual stocktaking. To take account of this practice, the Bill requires statements to be kept of all stocktakings. This is not a particularly onerous requirement. Companies are not being required under the Bill to carry out more frequent stocktakings. They are being requiredmerely to keep records of any which they carry out, subject to the over riding requirement in subsection (3)(b) that there must be a statement of stock held at the end of each financial year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terence Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the position under the 1948 Act? Is it the case that only a statement about the annual stocktaking need be kept?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is the case, as I thought I made clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is so, why do we need to take account of all stocktaking now? There has not been any complaint of the previous procedure under the 1948 Act. Although it is true, as the hon. Gentleman says, that there may be continuous stocktaking, presumably that could be brought in line by saying there should be a statement once a year or something of that kind. I understand, for example, that in some cases people in the liquor trade stock-take every time one person hands over to another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that event, all they have to do is to keep records of it. They presumably keep records anyway. They are not likely to do the stocktaking without making any record of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman suggested that there was some sinister connotation that the information might be used by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0811">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>265</span>
police. The information must be recorded for the company's own internal purposes. It is the minimum necessary to ensure that the management can assess the company's position and transactions, and it is largely already required to be recorded. No different use will be made of itfrom the use made of it under the present requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of confidentiality, the information is for internal purposes and normally will be available only to the company's offices, to be revealed in the course of a company investigation or winding up. There are no new powers and there is no new sinister element in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments 82 and 106 expand the statements which are required to be kept under subsection (3) of this clause. Therefore, the two amendments are in conflict with Amendment No. 33, if not incompatible with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government do not consider that the proposed requirements are desirable as they impose additional requirements which are not necessary in all cases and would impose an unjustified burden on companies. Hon. Gentlemen opposite have made great play of the need not to impose extra burdenns particularly on small companies. Here they are doing just that. The requirements in subsection (3) are subject to the overriding requirement in subsection (1) to keep accounting records which show, 	<i>inter alia,</i> the company's financial position and its transactions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsections (2) and (3) spell out the detailed minimum requirements as to the records which need to be kept by all companies. Many companies, especially the larger ones, will need to keep additional records in order to comply with subsection (1). What these additional records should cover will depend on the size of the company and the nature of its business. The Government have no wish to impose any requirement to keep records which serve no useful purpose, andI should have thought that hon. Gentlemen would agree with that proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is therefore vital to ensure that any records required to be kept by subsection (3) shall contain significant information about a company's affairs and are
	<span class='label label-info column'>266</span>
kept by every company, however small and whatever its line of business. The Government consider that the amendments, which the hon. Gentleman tabled but did not speak to, do not meet these criteria and will require the keeping of records which, in many cases, would merely impose an administration burden for no useful purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) prescribes matters to be recorded in accounting records by companies dealing in goods, and provides an exemption, in the case of goods sold by way of ordinary retail trade, from the requirement to record details of all goods sold and purchased, and of the buyers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 82 would have the effect of limiting this exemption to cases where such goods are sold for cash. While retailers selling for credit normally—in their own interests and those of the consumer—need to keep records of the goods and persons concerned in transactions, the Government do not consider that this should be an express legal requirement because in some cases it would impose a needlessly detailed requirement and present problems of interpretation. A retailer who, for instance, sells groceries on credit would certainly need to keep a record of the people to whom he sold and of the sums involved but he would not necessarily need to keep a record of precisely what groceries were involved. But if the amendment were accepted, he would be required to do so and to keep a detailed statement even when the bill had been paid. Frankly, I can see no use in that at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would also be problems of interpretation. What does " sold for cash " mean? What about cheques, credit cards and monthly accounts? There would be many problems to resolve, and retailers would have difficulty in deciding when the exemption applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Briefly, to deal with Amendment No. 106, the amendment seeks to include work in progress within the meaning of stock and stocktaking. It would thus require companies whose business involves dealing in goods to keep statements of work in progress as well as stock and stocktaking. Again, the Government view is that, although many companies will need to keep such statements, it is not a requirement that should be applied automatically to every com-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0812">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>267</span>
pany. Many small companies have little or no work in progress, and it would therefore be unnecessary to require them to keep records of such work. Companies where work in progress is a significant item need to keep statements of such work, anyway, in order to comply with the general requirement to keep records sufficient to disclose the financial position of the company and to enable accounts to be prepared. I have already referred to that requirement. In the Government's view, that requirement is not necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal with the general point why it is necessary to keep all records of stocktakings. It is because annual stocktakings are not always sufficient to show all steps taken to verify the stock held by the company. That is why there is a slight difference from the 1948 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I have dealt in a detailed manner with all the points raised. If hon. Gentlemen wish to raise further points, I shall be happy to deal with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Neubert</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to speak in support of Amendment No. 33 because I do not believe that the alarm of my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Shersby) is altogether misplaced. Certainly I am not entirely reassured by the account given by the Minister. We come to this amendment in a climate of growing concern about the powers of the executive to intervene and investigate the affairs of individuals engaged in commerce and industry. I for one was shocked by the revelations in the House earlier this week about the number of cases of Customs and Excise inspectors entering to examine records and obtain information relating to VAT returns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we have a proposal which would seem to require of companies very rigorous accounting for detailed transactions. Although it may be true that this is already in large part provided for by statute, in particular by the Companies Act 1948. we are now 28 years on from there-28 years nearer to 1984—and there is deep anxiety among members of the public and those engaged in business about the threat to their everyday activities from this kind of proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful if the Minister
	<span class='label label-info column'>268</span>
could indicate just what matters are required by the clause to be accounted for in these statements. An exemption is made for
	<br><blockquote><p>"goods sold by way of ordinary retail trade".</p></blockquote>
Could he define that? This is very much a matter of degree. Having started my commercial life by working in the supplies department of a large London Hospital, I understood that in dealing with matters of public money, in such circumstances, one had to be absolutely meticulous—so meticulous, in my recollection, that one was required to account even for half an ounce of split peas. Presumably that kind of degree of careful stocktaking is not intended under the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to be reassured that transactions which are required to be recorded and identified in terms of buyers and sellers are sufficiently large to be reasonable. My hon. Friend is surely right in saying that this has implications, first, of a great administrative burden on companies if they are required to account with such exactitude for the many activities they undertake in the course of a working day or a working week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we may be mistaken about this, but on the face of it the clause as it stands seems to intimate a degree of accountability which is really quite unwarranted. A stocktaking is in itself a warranted account of the position of the company at the time in terms of assets held. Surely that should be sufficient, rather than having to supply an account of individual movements of items between buyers and sellers and even perhaps within companies between different plants of the same company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All in all, this conjures up an impression of a considerable administrative burden. I should welcome a further exposition by the Minister of exactly what is implied. Where are the limits of this requirement? What evidence is there of a need for identification in the way suggested? Is there any good reason for continuing the present provision if it is shown not to be necessary in working practice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful for more reassurance than we have had so far on all those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, Ithink that the short debate on this amendment shows how necessary it is to discriminate between the large com-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0813">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>269</span>
panies and the very small companies. What my hon. Friends are concerned about here, I think, are the effects of this provision on one-man businesses and very small concerns which do not have the facilities to keep perfect and immaculate records, and that we are going too far if we try to oblige them to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question that arises in my mind is to what extent the 1948 Act has ever actually been applied in practice where this is concerned. I think that the Minister has a point when he draws our attention to Section 331 of the Companies Act 1948 where there are provisions on much the same lines as the paragraph in Clause 12 which we seek to delete.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot believe that this provision of the 1948 Act is applied universally. I am sure that auditors have used their discretion, or that businessmen have simply fallen down on the job without anything being done. We must realise that in the 1948 Act it is only a left-handed provision in that it is a definition of what proper records should have been kept, in retrospect, of companies that have been wound up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Department must do is see whether it is necessary to apply perfectionist regulations of this kind across the board. I believe that it is not. Further, is it necessary for these records to be kept for six years? The mere cost of storage and protection of old records is an expensive item which must be taken into account by small businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is said that every civilisation contains the seeds of its own decay. One thinks of Atlantis which was flooded and wiped out by the sea. We are creating a sea of paperwork for ourselves which is of no value, and which will destroy us unless we are extremely careful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terrence Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not find the Minister's reply at all satisfactory. Essentially he has to persuade us that the additional provisions which the Government propose to write into legislation are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of different points arise on this clause. First, as my hon. Friends have pointed out, this could have a very onerous effect on small businesses. That is something about which we have expressed concern throughout these proceedings. From that a number of curious facts begin to emerge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>270</span>
The Minister, in his initial remarks, said that similar provisions were to be found in Section 331 of the 1948 Companies Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister nods assent. But in fact Section 331 is, as I understand it, purely concerned with winding up provisions and has nothing to do with the normal operation of businesses. Perhaps the Minister has either been misinformed or he does not understand it, and if so he should sort that out by intervening. Section 331 of the 1948 Act begins:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If where a company is wound up it is shown that proper books of account were not kept …"</p></blockquote>
Later sections refer to " for the purposes of this section ", and so on. I am not clear why the Minister referred to Section 331. Would he care to confirm that that is the section he mentioned, or whether it is a mistake, and what is the actual position? Otherwise it will be difficult for us to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The latter part of Section 331 requires names of buyers and sellers to be shown, unless the sales and purchases were made in the course of ordinary retail trade. The requirement in Clause 12(2)(a), to give entries from day to day of moneys received and spent,follows a requirement in Section 147(1)(a) of the 1948 Act. The requirements are no more stringent than those of the 1948 Act in the section relating to the keeping of statements of allstocktakings. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman should read both sections in conjunction with each other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, and there may be something in Section 147 of the 1948 Act to which we can turn in a moment. However, subsection (1) of Section 331 begins:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If where a company is wound up it is shown that proper books of account were not kept …"</p></blockquote>
Subsection (2)—there are only two subsections in the section—begins:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of this section,".</p></blockquote>
It is, therefore, curious of the Minister to rely on that to say that it was neces-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0814">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>271</span>
sary to have the buyers and sellers of goods identified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister then referred us back to Section 147 of the Companies Act 1948. I cannot see any reference here to the identification of buyers and sellers. It may be that it is a curiosity of the drafting in the Act. If so, it is a little late to correct it. However, my understanding from the reference to buyers and sellers is that Section 147 is obviously the section of the 1948 Act which is related to the matter. As the Minister says, it is true that Section 331 includes this provision, but that is related to winding up. I shall leave the Minister to sort out that interesting historical problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are now concerned with whether we need to extend the provisions in the way in which the Government suggest. I think I am right in saying that buyers and sellers shall be identified. It is far from clear why that is a necessary provision. As my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) suggested, perhaps because of this curiosity in draftsmanship, the 1948 has never been applied in practice with regard to whether the buyers and sellers should be identified. Be that as it may, the overall impression is that this is a provision whichis now intended to be enforced and may well prove onerous to small businesses and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point arises on the question of keeping annual stocktakings. Up to now it has been necessary to keep only annual stocktakings. That was provided in the 1948 Act. I think I am also right in saying—although I do not feel bound to abide by every detail—that it was also the view at the time that the 1973 Act was introduced. Clearly, there must have been some change in official thinking between 1973 and now. The Minister's argument is that many people have more than one stocktaking or that they have continuous stocktaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, let us take, for example, the position of two companies, both of which are in the liquor trade. It is normal practice to have a stocktaking every time one person effectively hands over to another. One company may have three stocktakings a year and the other may have 25. Why should it be necessary for the company taking 25 stocktakings to keep all the details and produce them, if
	<span class='label label-info column'>272</span>
necessary, to show that it has kept proper accounts? Clearly, it would have been in the same position if it had only three stocktakings or, indeed, I think, only one. I do not see why it is necessary to specify all stocktakings rather than the annual stocktaking. That is the essence of our argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that an annual stocktaking may not contain sufficient details. I am surprised at that because, after all, that has been the situation with regard to company law since time immemorial. We are now suddenly told that that is not the position and that we must now have more details on all stock-takings produced. As for the continuous stocktaking problem, I should have thought that it would be reasonable to say that there must be an annual statement at some time, or that it should be produced not more than once every year. Again, I do not find that a convincing argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other points arise on subsection (3) which give cause for concern. Clause 12(3)(a) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"statements of all stocktaking … (except in the case of goods sold by way of ordinary retail trade)".</p></blockquote>
In one way that seems strange because it appears to mean that if one is in the ordinary retail trade it is not necessary to produce all stocktaking figures. On the other hand, there are some enterprises which are not in the way of ordinary retail trade—for example, discount houses and so on, which presumably would not be regarded as being in ordinary retail trade. Why should they be treated differently? This is not clear from the overall position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, it seems to be unnecessary to tighten up in this way when, for many of these people,the value added tax legislation would require them to keep far more complex records than previously available. This seems an unnecessary duty to impose on companies generally in addition to those which are already imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subject to any really persuasive arguments from the Minister that after all these years we should suddenly alter the situation and, indeed, since 1973 we should change our view, I think my present inclination is to suggest to my hon. Friends that we should support this amendment. I am not convinced by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0815">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>273</span>
the Minister's suggestions at this stage, but it may be that we shall need to look at the matter again between now and Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shersby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I should like more information than the Minister has already provided. He says that the purpose of the clause is merely to keep records. It seems to me that the clause as drafted will require the average company to keep records in a good deal more detail than has been the case in the past. Also, it is not clear precisely what is meant by this business of taking " statements of all stocktakings ", whether this is to be done on a weekly or a monthly basis, or whatever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to ask the Minister a question about the position of mail order companies. Are they to be classed as retail for the purposes of this clause, or are they not? This is a business which I happen to know a little about, and I can assure the Minister that many mail order companies deal with many millions of transactions each year. For example, it is quite common practice for many food companies to advertise a variety of goods on their food packets, such as packets of cereals, and one can quote many other examples. Millions of these packets go into circulation every week. As a result, millions of orders for goods are placed with mail order houses. I should like to know whether the mail order house concerned will be required to record the name and address of every buyer of every single article which is purchased for example, through a mail order house. Similarly there are many sellers of goods to such companies. It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not heard today anything which convinces us that the inclusion of this clause in the Bill does not place a greater burden on companies than they bear at present. Unless we can receive some clarification of the matter which persuades us to change our minds, I would agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) that we should press this amendment to a Division, and hope that the Government will think again before the Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that
	<span class='label label-info column'>274</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—or unnecessary, but the changes to which hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Member be specific? Have the representatives of accountancy bodies called for this provision to apply to the smallest busineses'? It is important to realise that even the auditing profession, which is 80,000 strong, is not capable of doing this work for all those 600,000 companies known to the registrar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The accounting bodies have called for it in general but they have not, to my knowledge, called for an exception to be made in the case of small businesses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are we to understand that they have explicity stated they want to have all stocktaking shown?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They have pointed out the shortcomings and they approve of the proposals in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We want to be quite clear about this because we have had problems before on exactly what representations have been made.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is consistent with what—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said they recommended it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is what the accountancy bodies approve of. The Bill is consistent with their views. The number of stocktakings depends on how the company conducts its business. If it chooses to do regular stocktaking, it should keep records of them because it is part of the internal accounting system.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0816">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>275</span>
I can see very little point in doing a stocktaking if the company does not keep a record of it. I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman would appreciate that stocktaking is an essential part of the company's financial provision. The hon. Gentleman really exaggerates the difficulties that will be placed in a company's way. If it is doing a stocktaking, it is elementary to expect it to keep a record. That is all that the Bill requires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, the memorandum of the Society of Conservative Accountants—to which much reference has been made and upon which the Opposition places great weight—does not recommend deleting Clause 12(3). That is something that the hon. Gentleman might like to bear in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also, for what it is worth, the Press comment on the Bill particularly welcomed the tightening up of the requirements relating to the keeping of records of stock. The hon. Gentleman is being unnecessarily alarmist about the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is quite right in saying that Section 331 applies—it is specifically mentioned in the Bill—only if a company is being wound up. But the offence is committed in the two years before the winding up. Therefore, it obviously applies in those circumstances to all companies. It is necessary to act in conformity with the requirements of Section 331 throughout its operation. It cannot suddenly have to act in conformity with it the moment it is wound up. The offence is committed, as is stated quite specifically, in the two years before the winding up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kensington referred to the obligation to preserve the records for six years. It is true that subsection (7) imposes an obligation to preserve for six years any accounting records which are required to be kept by virtue of the clause. However, if a company hasbeen wound up and its affairs settled, it may be unnecessary for those records to be preserved for so long. The subsection, therefore, provides that the obligation shall not apply if a direction about the disposal of the records is made under the winding up rules. These are rules about matters relating to the winding up of companies made by statutory instrument by the Lord Chancellor in consultation with the Secretary of State under Section 365 of
	<span class='label label-info column'>276</span>
the 1948 Act. Under Rule 206 of the Companies Winding-Up Rules 1949, the Department may make directions about the disposal of the records of a company which has been wound up and may determine for how long they may be preserved. The exemption will allow this practice to continue. I hope that answers the hon. Gentleman's point. " Retail trades ", which is not a new phrase, means goods sold over the counter, but " mail order " would be retail business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neubert</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This does not seem to me to be good enough. I have listened carefully to what the Minister said. He has not sought to give any definitive answer to the questions I have raised, and I remain considerably alarmed by what is proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me first state the common ground between us. It is not disputed—indeed, it is confirmed—that subsection (3)(a) is taken, word for word, from the Companies Act 1949.But we are not, 28 years later, convinced of its necessity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect to my hon. Friend, I do not think that is correct. The 1948 Act, even if one refers to the rather curious Section 3(3)(1) which seems to bounce backwardsinto other sections where no reference is made to it, does not refer to every stocktaking. On annual stocktaking, the 1948 Act is not consistent with what the Government now propose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neubert</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think subsection (3)(a), leaving aside paragraph (b), is word for word, identical to a provision in the 1948 Act, but no matter. Subsection (3)(b) adds to it. I accept thatit is in the 1948 Act, but it does not have to be reaffirmed here and now. Further, I am not reassured by the vague and airy assurance from the Minister of support from professional authorities for this proposal. Unless there is chapter and verse citing this provision and giving it specific support, it is not good enough to be told that professional associations made no objection to it. Perhaps they had not noticed the implications of the clause, and that, surely, is our role in Committee. If we come across implications of some importance and raise themin Committee, the professional authorities may be grateful that we have spotted something which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0817">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>277</span>
they have missed. Nothing that I heard in the evidence given in the absence of our representative from the Society of Conservative Accountants persuades me to go along with this proposal without a great deal more information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hasten to say that I did not refer to that august body specifically because the hon. Gentleman was not there; he just did not happen to be there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neubert</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the Minister will realise that I am trying to make a fair point. Because no reference is made, one cannot assume that no objection would be taken if the implications were fully understood or noticed. There is a real possibility that members of the Committeemay have come across a point that may have been missed not only by the original authors and examiners of the 1948 Act but by professional bodies which have had cause to examine the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked for a definition of ordinary retail trade. A quick glance at the 1948 Act shows that it does not appear in the interpretation section. It is important to know to what level of transaction this proposal would descend. Although we speak in favour of small businesses, I should like to speak on behalf of large businesses. Although they may have the staff, resources and capacity to accommodate the requirements accepted in matters of accounting records and so many other administrative matters, it does not mean that this is a good thing—that the cost of that administrative time is not included in the price of the product or in the service to the consumer. It does not mean that that administrative burden is not a drag on the creation of new wealth and added value which surely should be our prime objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is common ground and commonplace these days that many businesses, large and small, have to give a considerable amount of their executive time to the State. This is a trend which must be reversed. Therefore, if we go back to the Act of 1948, it would perhaps be salutory if we considered some of the requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys-Williams) and I both asked what evidencethere is that this provision has ever been implemented
	<span class='label label-info column'>278</span>
to the degree suggested by the words in the Bill. Has it been required of companies that they must identify each buyer and seller? Is the Minister suggesting that an annual stocktaking is in some way less detailed and less informative than interim stocktakings? I find it difficult to think of circumstances in which that would be likely. Surely the annual stocktaking is for the purposes of the company itself and the year-end record, and defines the changes which have taken place since the end of the previous year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although a company may, for the purpose of its stock control, take interim stocktakings, surely there is no less information contained in the annual stocktaking for tax purposes than is given by the interim statements. Interim stock-takings could be taken daily in businesses where items constantly change. Such a case would include motor manufacturers, for example, wherelarge quantities of spare parts might be changing positions rapidly during a working day. Is it expected of a company that it should retain records of these spot checks made every few hours? With computer stock control, that may well be so. Are companies to retain all the print-outs of individual parts in their thousands, merely to comply with the provisions of the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Briefly, the position, as the hon. Gentleman will appreciate, is that the annual stocktaking may include book records of stock which were counted earlier in the year.If a company subsequently issues a prospectus and has not kept all stock records, it may receive only a qualified report from the accountants. The annual stocktaking in some cases is therefore not completely adequate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neubert</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My colleagues and I will have to consider whether that answer is adequate. However, I hope that the Minister will be good enough to address himself to the other matters which I have raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer again to the growing concern that must be felt on these two counts. I have read recently that the State had about 400 different powers to search, enter, examine and investigate company records. It is not good enough for the Minister to come to the Committee today and say that this has been hallowed by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0818">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>279</span>
the passing of time, which is 28 years on from the original Act, and is therefore entirely acceptable without any evidence of its useful purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the case of manufacturing industry, wholesalers and retailers, it would seem reasonable that the clause should apply. But in the case of smaller businesses, it does not seem to be so relevant. The Parliamentary Secretary said that the phrase " retail trade " is not a new phrase. Surely, after 28 years, we are entitled to have some clarity of definition in the Bill so that the ordinary public who read the Bill will understand what they are reading. This is particularly so when the onus of proof for possible imprisonment up to two years is placed on the defendant and not on the prosecution. It is not clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens in the case of firms which give a discount for quantity? One often goes into a retail shop where goods are sold off by the dozen. An item is offered on wholesale terms. Is such a shopkeeper supposed to keep a different account for that? The distinction should surely be clear in the Bill. It should be clear to the man who runs the shop. He should not have to seek secret information elsewhere to know whether he is within the law or outside it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of the sellers and the buyers being identified. There is no limit whatever on size. This proposed procedure would be quite natural for a substantial business and where there are proper records due to be kept between normal wholesalers and normal retailers in a standard trade, but what about a little farmyard company, with just a few acres, which would like to sell chickens over the farm gate. If it sells one chicken to one picnicker, must it record who that picnicker is and if he was out with his wife?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole thing would be carried to an absurdity in such examples. Perhaps the law is never enforced to this degree, but if that is so there should be exemptions under the law so that the public knows where it stands. May we have a more precise definition of those two points?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it is clear that there are two essential points at issue. One is whether the individual buyers and sellers need to be identified, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>280</span>
other is whether the order for stocktaking needs to be shown on more than an annual basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the first point, what has become apparent is that the 1948 Act is extremely curious. Section 147, which should have had this point included, clearly did not, and one has to rely, as the Minister has, on Section 331 and argue that all companies might go into liquidation and that therefore they keep proper accounts only if they operate on that basis. That is a curious arrangement and we do not know whether it has ever been tested in the courts. I rather doubt,if it were tested in the courts—and the company had not gone into liquidation—that one could argue that Section 331 should apply. The Minister may know whether it has been tested in the courts. It is something we would wish to check because otherwise I suspect that in practice it has not been enforced and has not been a universal practice. On that we have doubts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Between now and Report we may be convinced that it would be right to clarity the position andinclude this in the Bill. On the other hand, we come to the question of annual audits. I am totally unconvinced by the arguments of the Minister, who cites special cases and says that the annual audit may not have been carried out by the time a company is taken over. If that is so, a special stocktaking would be likely. There is no reason, as my hon. Friends have said, why a firm should be obliged to keep records of stocktakings carried out purely for internal purposes—for example, to show what the stock may be when one individual in a company hands over to another. That would add to a mass of paper work, storage and everything else, which seems totally unnecessary. The Minister has not explained why, if annual stocktakings have been adequate from time immemorial till now, we must suddenly tighten the matter up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the right course of action would be to look at this before Report. As of now I find the clause objectionable. One should reinstate the points in sufficient detail to enable goods and buyers to be identified. We should need to take advice on that and we should wish also to consult the accountancy bodies. The Minister's original statement was that they had recommended that all stocktaking should be included. I find that a surprising
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0819">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>281</span>
statement, and I have had no evidence in support of it. We wish to consult on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are left with the question whether we should leave the paragraph in or knock it out so that we can be sure of returning to the matter on Report. The Government have given no undertaking to look at this matter now and make changes on Report. The right course of action would beto knock it out, take advice and return to the matter on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Subsection (8) refers to the situation where,

This is a probing amendment. We are not clear whether it is the intention of the Government that that offence should apply to the auditor. Presumably a situation can arise where the company</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>282</span>
	<p>is the question of keeping all these records for six years. He gave me a fair answer when he said that in the event of winding up it was not necessary for the company, after winding up, to retain the records. Well and good, but what we are talking about is the retention of records by businesses which are continuing. Six years seems a ridiculously long period.</p>

	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided;</i> Ayes 7, Noes 7</p>
	<p>is in default on a day-to-day basis. The auditor is not in attendance every moment of the time, and he might, therefore, find that be had committed an offence although he had adopted normal accounting and auditing practices. There may be a good reason why the subsection has been so drafted, but it would be helpful if the Government would let us know.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that this is a probing amendment and I understand his reasons for seeking information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are circumstances in which an auditor could be responsible for a default, and in those circumstances it is right that he should be liable. The amendment, if carried, would exempt the auditor from any liability for a company's failure to comply with subsections (1) to (5) of this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The expression " officer … in default " which appears in subsection (8) is used throughout the Companies Act 1948 and is defined in Section 440 of that Act as
	<br><blockquote><p>"any officer … who knowingly and wilfully authorises or permits"</p></blockquote>
a particular default. In small companies the auditor also often acts as an accountant and is, therefore, directly responsible for the keeping of proper records. Under the terms of the amendment a person
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0820">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>283</span>
acting as an accountant would be exempted from any liability by virtue of the fact that he was also the auditor. I am sure the hon. Gentleman agrees that that would not be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, an auditor, even if he were not also the company's accountant, might in the course of his audit duties in some way permit or cause accounting records to be destroyed. That is not unheard of. In that case it is right that he should be liable. On the other hand, if the default occurs but the auditor has not " knowingly and wilfully " permitted it, then he has nothing to fear as he would not be an " officer ‧ in default".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point which the hon. Gentleman is now making was put forward by the consultative committee of accountancy bodies in their comments on the Bill. In discussions it was agreed, for the reasons I have given, that it would not be appropriate to exclude the auditor from the definition of " officer " and thus automatically exempt him from any liability for default, irrespective of whether he was, in practice, wholly or party responsible for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that adequately explains why it would not be right to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that Section 440 of the 1948 Act included the words that an officer must " knowingly and wilfully " be in default to committ an offence. However subsection (8) of the Bill states that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"every officer of the company who is in default shall be guilty of an offence unless he shows that he acted honestly."</p></blockquote>
There is a contradiction between the 1948 Act and the Bill. The Bill puts the onus on the defendant to prove his honest intention, rather than leave it to the prosecution to prove dishonest intention as it appears to be in Section 440 of the 1948 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The prosecution must prove that the auditor is, in the first place, an officer in default. It is then open to the defendant to show that he had acted honestly and
	<span class='label label-info column'>284</span>
that the default was excusable. The burden of proof is on the prosecution. In the course of showing that he was not in default, the auditor would have to show that he acted according to the words of the 1948 Act, and that he had not " knowingly and wilfully " permitted it. He could then counter that by showing that he had acted honestly and that the default was excusable. He has, therefore, a built-in defence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary, but I am not sure that he has answered my question. I should be grateful if he would look at this again. It is the words onthe top of page 16 of the Bill that cause anxiety, because the onus of proof of dishonest intention should lie with the prosecution, as well as merely on the question of default. From the Parliamentary Secretary's own words, I took the implication that the onus of proof lies with the prosecution in relation to intention as well as default in the section of the 1948 Act which he quoted. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will reconsider that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly will, and if I am in any way wrong in my interpretation I will contact the hon. Gentleman. The prosecution must prove that the auditor was an officer in default. In seeking to prove that, it has to prove that the auditor had knowingly and wilfully permitted the default. That has still to be proved, and it is a heavy burden for the prosecution. It is then open to the defence to establish that he acted honestly and that the default was excusable. So the burden is still on the prosecution to prove the " knowingly and wilfully".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is so, would it not be possible to carry the wording of the 1948 Act into the Bill so that the public understand that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there is any ambiguity or if it would help in any way, I will certainly look at that. I well appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister's initial reply to the points that I raised was entirely satisfactory, which is an improvement on some of the earlier replies we have had. Therefore, I do not wish to press the amendment. The point that my hon. Friend has just made, I think, is a genuine point and we welcome
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0821">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>285</span>
the Government's genuine undertaking to look at it again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the face of it, the wording that is now suggested, in contrast with the earlier legislation, is rather curious. On the one hand, it is said that the individual concerned, to be in default, would have had to have done so " knowingly and wilfully". On the other hand, it is an excuse if he " acted honestly". This seems a very odd animal. There may be many things that one has to do or is obliged by law to do which in no way would be excused if one could say that one was quite honest about it. I therefore hope that the Minister will look at that again. Subject to that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I move this very briefly as I am off my ground in dealing with matters of law, but I think that this is an area where the Minister shines particularly brightly and we therefore look forward to hearing what he has to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that it will be obvious to students of company law where this amendment came from. I read the recommendations of the inspectors in the London and County Securities affair and saw their suggestion that this would be a useful amendment to company law, namely, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"(8) Any officer of the company who knowingly gives inaccurate or misleading information to the auditors shall be guilty of an offence."</p></blockquote>
As we fortunately have the Companies (No. 2) Bill before us at the moment, I hope that I am serving a useful purpose by recommending that the Committee should consider the matter. I think that I need say no more, except that if, as I believe, there is in fact a lacuna here in the law, clearly it ought to be filled and I shall be glad to hear whether the Minister agrees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Clinton Davies)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising this matter. In fact, he anticipated, as I had indicated previously, that the Government themselves would be dealing with the matter, and this we propose to do. He is right in asserting that it was the view of the inspectors that the present law requires fortifying and that directors and officers
	<span class='label label-info column'>286</span>
of a company who knowingly give inaccurate or misleading information to the auditors should be liable criminally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might help the Committee if I set out briefly the current state of the law and how we envisage that it should be changed. I regret that we cannot accept the amendment in its present form, but I think that when I come to that the hon. Gentleman will accept the force of my argument in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present it is a criminal offence for an officer of a company deliberately to give false information to the auditor. Officers are required to give to the auditor such information and explanation as he calls upon them to make, pursuant, of course, to his duties as auditor. It is also a criminal offence under the Perjury Act knowingly to provide false information in any document or oral statement which a person is required or enabled by statute to make. It would also be an offence under the Companies Acts for an officer to provide false information in a document submitted to the auditor. So the law does in some respects provide for the situation which excited the attention of the inspectors, but in my judgment it does not go far enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, it deals only with false information and not with misleading information. I should have thought that misleading information can in many respects be quite as damaging to the interests of those concerned in the company as information which is false. Secondly, the existing provisions are perhaps somewhat general, and it may be that auditors are insufficiently aware of the existing provisions. We therefore feel that it is helpful to make the matter quite explicit. Indeed, I should have thought that it would also strengthen the hand of any auditor who suspected that the officers of a company were trying to mislead or to hide something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we agree in principle with the amendment. I come now, however, to the reasons why I say that it is defective in some respects. First, it creates a criminal offence but withoutany sanction, which I think is not acceptable. Not only is it impossible to have a criminal offence would without a sanction, but by implication it means that the provision relating to the criminal offence would have no teeth.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0822">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>287</span>
Therefore, in that respect the amendment is seriously defective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we take the point that it may be better to deal with this matter elsewhere in the Bill, as Clause 12 relates essentially to companies' accounting records. This is a separate point and we think that it is more appropriate to deal with it in the shape of a new clause, which I would hope to put forward for consideration later in Committee so that the Committee will have the opportunity to look at the Government's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am therefore able to give a firm undertaking to the hon. Gentleman in that regard, and I hope that he will feel it appropriate to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to the Minister for his enlightening remarks andhelp on this suggestion of mine and for his promise to introduce a new clause which will give effect to the intention but will do it better than my own amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I introduced the amendment at this point because the next part of the clause, subsection (9) provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable—"</p></blockquote>
and then specifies the penalties to which that person shall be liable. I thought that in that way the Minister's point about creating a criminal offence without any sanction would be covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, this is a matter on which he is expert and on which the Department obviously has given him expert advice, so I would not want to take that point any further. I look forward with great interest to seeing the new clause which he produces, and I am glad that all the work which I and my hon. Friends and colleagues on both sides of the House have done in thinking about the reform of company law is to bear this small but I hope useful fruit.

In marketing jargon, I think that he often puts forward something which is " a good product, but ahead of its time". We are glad that on this occasion the product's time has come and something is actually to be done about the interesting suggestions that he has made. Certainly, it is not unusual for him to be ahead of the Government.

	<div class='title'>QUALIFICATIONS OF AUDITORS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shersby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 87, in page 16, line 29, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the British Association of Accountants and Auditors."</p></blockquote>
The purpose of this amendment is to enable the Committee to consider the desirability of adding the British Association of Accountants and Auditors to the list of bodies of accountants recognised by the Secretary of State for the purposes of Section 161(1)(a) of the Companies Act 1948. Section 161(1) simply requires that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A person shall not be qualified for appointment as auditor of a company unless either (	<i>a</i>)he is a member of a body of accountants established in the United Kingdom and for the time being recognised … by the Department of Trade."</p></blockquote>
Clause 13, as drafted, lists for the first time in a statute bodies of accountants whose members are qualified for appointment as auditors. Why is the British Association of Auditors and Accountants not included in that list'? I hope to enable the Committee to consider this matter and it may be helpful if I give some brief details of the Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Association was founded in 1923, since when it has been an examining body. The only deviation from its functions as an examining body has been to admit to membership those persons authorised by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0823">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>289</span>
the Department of Trade under Section 161(1)(b) of the 1948 Act, which relates to a person for the time being authorised by the Department either as having similar accounting qualifications to those of a United Kingdom body of accountants but obtained outside the United Kingdom, or as having obtained adequate knowledge and experience in the course of his employment by a member of a body of accountants recognised as having practised in Great Britain as an accountant before 6th August 1947.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Association has deviated to the extent that it has contributed to the consolidation of the accountancy profession by absorbing the membership of two contemporary professional bodies where not all members have passed examinations. All members of the association are subject to disciplinary control and are required to adhere to the accepted ethics and standards of the profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The membership of the association is divided into three categories: fellows, associates and licentiates. Licentiates are required to sit the final examinations before being considered for associate membership. Students are required to sit all three examinations—intermediate, final (Section 1) and final (Section 2). Members engaged in public practice are employed in the office of practising accountants and are engaged in commerce, industry and local and national government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman arguing that the standards of examination and marking of this body are in any substantial respect comparable to those of the other professional institutes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shersby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to demonstrate that this is an examining body of some considerable standing and that, in addition to its examining function and its standards since its inceptionin 1923, it is also widely engaged in a variety of auditing and accounting functions and is widely known and respected by both local and national government, by industry and commerce. I hope to deploy these points briefly so that we can consider the nature of the association and its understandable feeling that it should be included in the list. That is my sole purpose in moving the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The division of membership between the areas of professional activity is as follows: Members engaged in public practice as principals number 797, or 62
	<span class='label label-info column'>290</span>
per cent. of membership; members engaged in the offices of practising accountants number 181,or 14 per cent. of membership; members engaged in commerce, industry, local government or national Government number 306, or 24 per cent. of membership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of those engaged in public practice and in the employ of practitioners, 978, or 76 per cent. in total are qualified as follows: 87 members, or 9 per cent., have passed examinations; 373,or 38 per cent., have been authorised by the Department of Trade under Section 161(1)(b) of the 1948 Act; 82, or 8 per cent., have been authorised under Section 13 of the Companies Act 1967; 14, or 1 per cent., hold authorities granted by Northern Ireland or by foreign Governments. But the residue of 422, or 44 per cent., have passed no examination, which relates to the point made by the Under-Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 797 sole practitioners employ approximately 8,700 people. They are instrumental in collecting a variety of taxes or approving payments amounting to millions of £s each year. The association's members are involved in working in some 16,000 companies. It is therefore possible to demonstrate to the Committee that the association's members play an important part in industry, commerce and government, that they are well respected and that a large percentage of them are qualified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful if I give a brief historical note. In 1968 a scheme was proposed for the development of the accountancy profession in Great Britain and Ireland, sponsored by the senioraccountancy bodies, and the association was to have been included in that scheme together with the Faculty of Accountants and Auditors, whose members were subsequently taken into membership of the association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At a meeting in the Albert Hall on 17th April 1969 the main scheme for the accountancy profession was accepted by the sponsoring members and the addendum to the scheme, which included the association, was carried on a show of hands by a narrow majority. The narrowness of the result led the sponsoring bodies to indicate that they did not feel justified at that time in proceeding with these proposals which would have included the association and the Faculty of Accountants and Auditors Limited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the historical background to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0824">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>291</span>
situation which has resulted in the association not being included in the clause. I hope that the Under-Secretary will be able to give us a clear indication of the Department's feeling about the standards observed by the association and of any consideration that has been given by the Department to the syllabus of its examination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think everyone feels sympathy with the Government in their anxiety to preserve a high standard of qualification for this kind of work. None the less, all of us must also feel anxious at the establishment of an official collective monopoly of certain bodies entitled to do certain work and the exclusion of other bodies from doing that work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does not that bring out, once again, the need for distinction between large and small firms? It is possible to envisage that those who have been in accountancy practice for many years, or who have lesser examinations, could do accountancy and auditing work relative to small firms but that they might not be able to deal with the complexities of large businesses. It seems to me that there is a strong case here for the Government looking again at the need for separate legislation for smaller firms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems hard that these people, who have been entitled to practise in the past, may be excluded. I hope that the Government will give sympathetic consideration to what my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Shersby) has proposed on their behalf.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not certain that I entirely support my hon. Friend in his amendment—not because I know anything against the British Association of Accountants and Auditors; for all I am aware they may be the most admirable people. Where I do not support him is in the feeling that this is a question that can be settled in Committee. I do not think that it is possible for Members of Parliament to sit in judgment on questions which inevitably raise knotty professional matters, questions of syllabus and examination standards and professional standing about which we cannot possibly claim to be informed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has served a valuable purpose in drawing attention to the danger
	<span class='label label-info column'>292</span>
that we may be freezing the monopoly of the existing accountancy bodies, and that a better procedure than that laid down in the Bill may be necessary for considering ways in which changes should be made in the list of bodies which should be empowered under the Act to carry out these functions. I am concerned that, because of the difficulty of persuading Departments to act when they probably have all too much concern in other directions at the same time, we may be excluding the possibility of new entrants coming into the profession unless they are prepared to find their way up within the privileged area of the established bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the danger that we are freezing a mechanism which will allow those once inside the list perhaps to decline in efficiency because of their secure status under the Act. Their expertise might grow obsolete and, although they might, in 1976, be admirably qualified to perform the functions we envisage, the functions of the auditors will change as the years go by. In 10 or 20 years Parliament may have given the privilege to the professional body which is no longer appropriate. This requires the Minister's comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to know exactly what the Department's feeling is about the procedure on the question of appeals. I believe I have made clear that we have to make a conscious effort to widen the audit. I want to take in the present and future and to extend into management accounting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I, and others who feel as I do, are right there will be changes over the next few years. There will certainly be changes if Parliament implements the sort of recommendations we expect from the Bullock Committee. My hon. Friend has initiated a useful debate and, although I shall not support his amendment because I do not know whether he is right or wrong—I do not think Members of Parliament can know-I hope we shall have some comments on the whole subject from the Minister which will show us the way in which the Department intends to interpret its powers if the clause is passed as drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think many members of the Committee have had representations on this matter both from members of the British Association of Accountants and Auditors in favour of the inclusion of its
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0825">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>293</span>
name in this list and other representations arguing the opposite view. There are some serious points here which we ought to consider, although I understand the point that my hon. Friend has just made about the difficulty of Members of Parliament judging qualifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the first occasion on which such a list has been included. I think I am right in saying that there has not been one hitherto. I am not entirely sure why the Government feel it right to establish the situation precisely. No doubt the Minister will wish to explain that to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That having been said, it is worth commenting on the broad situation. I have been looking at the 	<i>Accountant</i> for 8th July 1976, which includes a list of accountancy bodies. I must say that the figures for the expansion of the accountancy profession are remarkable. " Remarkable " would be the most objective expression I could use because whereas, for example, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales had a membership of 14,632 in 1950, by 1976 it had grown to 61,718. That reflects the enormously increased burden falling on companies having to deal with taxation and accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also declare a slight bias, if not an interest, as an economist inasmuch as I think it is true to say that the accountancy profession now is far more " progressive " than it used to be with its adherence to the concept of historic costs which I, as an economist, found frightening. We are making some progress on that and, in the light of the Sandilands Report and the Morpeth Committee, we shall make still more progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the precise situation with which we are concerned. The same issue of the 	<i>Accountant</i>gives the total membership of the various bodies, including that of the British Association of Accountants and Auditors. The total membership of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales is 61,718 and the number in practice is 16,088. The British Association of Accountants and Auditors is much smaller, with a membership of 1,399, but 793 of its members are in practice. This brings out an interesting point: a far higher percentage of the members of the association are in practice than is the case with other bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Government's list in this clause includes the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland. That body has
	<span class='label label-info column'>294</span>
not very many more people in practice than does the British Association of Accountants and Auditors - 861 as against 793. It is not a question of absolute size of membership which we are concerned with. That is a point which we need to take into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two aspects to this. The first concerns the individual members of the British Association of Accountants and Auditors, a high percentage of whom are in practice and, secondly, the position of the association itself. I share my hon. Friend's concern about the danger of creating a cartel of professional accountants. There is a strong case for having, in the economist's jargon, freedom of entry, but, as I understand it, the Secretary of State may, under Clause 2, make regulations by statutory instrument which will enable him to add or delete particular bodies. Thus, there is a certain degree of flexibility in the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question arises, is this a body which should be included in the list now—that is perhaps something on which the Minister will comment—and if it is not to be included this presumably is on grounds of the qualifications of the members. All of us in Committee appreciate the desire not only to maintain auditing and other standards but to improve them. But if it is a question of the standard of examination and the percentage of members who may havepassed the examination, perhaps the Minister would make clear whether his concern is about the examination standards or about the fact that some members do not have to pass examinations.If it is a question of the examinations themselves, presumably the matter could be covered by the association raising its examination standards. That may not be practical immediately, butI should like an assurance from the Minister that it could do that and, if that is his objection, to know whether the Secretary of State would be prepared to make an order on the lines suggested in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point with regard to membership—whether some members have not passed examinations—is more difficult. We want to ensure that adequate standards are set. This brings me to the question of individual members. It is important if auditors have been practising as members of the British Association of Accountants and Auditors under existing legislation. As far as one knows, they have done so perfectly adequately and comparably with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0826">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>295</span>
other bodies. It would be unfortunate if we were, therefore, by passing the clause, simply to deprive those practising members of the association of their livelihood because they would be excluded under the terms of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I could have the Minister's attention as I should like a clear answer on this matter.I refer to the situation of the members of the British Association of Accountants and Auditors who are now in practice and who have been authorised. Will the Minister confirm that there is no possibility, except in the normal course of business, of their authorisation being withdrawn? That would inevitably mean in an arbitrary way that standards have been changed. I therefore hope that we may have from the Minister a clear statement of his view about the possibility of the association raising its standards and becoming qualified and included in the list by statutory instrument, if the Government are not prepared to accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, will the Minister indicate the exact position of individual members of this association? I understand that in some firms members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants for England and Wales are working under members of the British Association of Accountants and Auditors. That creates a difficult situation and we hope that it will be possible for the Government to reconcile these conflicting representations in a way satisfactory to all concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make one or two points of a prefatory nature before dealing with the specific matters which have been raised by hon. Gentlemen this morning. First, there is no formal application before the Department from the BAAA. It is clear, therefore, that there is no question of the amendment being acceptable. I would have thought that it would be wholly inappropriate for the Committee to introduce this form of provision for recognition in advance of any formal application on the part of the Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is that I have written about this in great detail to a number of Members of Parliament, including, I think, the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins), and I have dealt with all the points he has made before the Committee. If the hon. Gentleman merely
	<span class='label label-info column'>296</span>
wants me to reiterate those points so that it is on the public record, I shall do so. It is amatter which the public is entitled to know about. The association already knows the situation because we have dealt with the points made in correspondence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say thirdly, by way of preface, that the members of the Association have not been recognised under Section 161(1) (	<i>a</i>)by successive Governments other than in the way to which I shall refer later. It is not simply a whim on my part or on the part of the Secretary of State. We are not satisfied with the examination and marking standards of the association. We say that they are not comparable with those of the professional bodies which are naturally and rightly concerned that the established standards should not be watered down. I should have thought that the whole of the Committee would be with me on that point. Auditors carry a high duty of care. It would be quite wrong if we were to embark upon a process which indicated that the Government did not take that duty of care very seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the view, therefore, following from this, that if we were to accept the amendment—I do not think that the hon. Gentleman seriously expects us to do that—it would inevitably involve dilution in existing auditing standards. This would be prejudicial not simply to the accountancy profession—although it is important to maintain high standards—but it would be of considerable importance to the public at large, to creditors, and shareholders, all of whom are very much concerned with high auditing standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This does not mean that the BAAA is debarred from recognition in the future. This point was made by the hon. Member for Worthing. If members of the association are to be recognised, they must satisfy the Secretary of State that they are fulfilling the strict criteria laid down for recognition. For example, they would have to satisfy the Secretary of State that there is some independent assessment of the examination and marking standards which they apply. They would need to indicate clearly that a substantial majority of the members of the association must have been admitted on the basis of satisfactory examinations. The hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Shersby) said that 40 per cent., as a rough calculation, had in fact passed no examination.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0827">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>297</span>
That is not a satisfactory fulfilment of the criteria set by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed abolition of fresh authorisations to which hon. Members have obliquely referred—perhaps this will be debated later—is a matter on which it might be helpful if I were to say a few words now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This authorisation is provided for under Section 161(1)(b) of the Companies Act 1948, on the grounds of adequate knowledge and experience. The provisions that we are making for abolishing fresh authorisations under Clause 13(4) certainly will not mean the end of this association. There is no reason for that. It will not prejudice the position of people who have been authorised under Section 161(1)(b) in the past, providing always that they do not behave aberrently in some material way, when of course their position would be prejudiced, just as that of any other auditor would be prejudiced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make it quite plain here that the suggestion made in correspondence through the BAAA to Members of Parliament that the position of these people would be impaired is based wholly on a misconception. I hope that I have made that abundantly plain to hon. Members who have corresponded with me about it. It would be most unfortunate if this misconception were to be broadcast further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Uxbridge said that the organisation had been in existence since 1923. I do not think it is necessarily a good argument that because an organisation has been in existence for a long time its standards are necessarily adequate—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]My hon. Friend anticipated my next remark. I want to try to carry the hon. Gentleman with me, and I was debating in my mind whether I should put it forward at all. But quite clearly and seriously I do not think that that point merits a great deal of consideration. Too large a proportion of members have been admitted other than by the association's own examinations. These examinations in any event are not of a satisfactory character at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we have done, therefore, in order to try to assist the association to give reconsideration to the whole matter, is to say that we shall look at the new syllabus that it has put forward, but the syllabus in itself is not a satisfactory fulfilment of the criteria. We want the
	<span class='label label-info column'>298</span>
association to provide some independent assessment of marking and examination standards. This has not yet been set up. I hope that due consideration will be given to that proposition. In those ways, we shall certainly be prepared to look most constructively on the situation. The association is not debarred from making an application for recognition in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Worthing asked me why we listed a number of bodies on this occasion when this has not been done previously. We thought that it was right that the public at large should know which bodies were recognised by the Secretary of State. That is why it was done. It is helpful and I think it clarifies the situation. It is not done in order to further some sinister design to cement a monopoly which has been established. It is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. The hon. Gentleman answered his own question that size did not appear to him to be the criterion. He is absolutely right. It is standards that are the essential criteria to be honoured.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little worried about the question of listing. I have been looking at the debates on the Companies Bill 1967, to which we have referred comparatively little. There, arguments are put forward against having a list. The crucial thing is whether it is right to put it in legislation. My hon. Friend says that we are not in a position to judge and that is a true statement of the situation. I do not think anyone on the Committee would feel that he was in a position to judge, nor does he have the data about whether the examinations of this or that professional body are adequate. Yet that is, in effect, what we are being asked to do. We are not simply being told that the Secretary of State shall decide this and publish a list which will be well-known and well publicised. We are being asked to write it into the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not say that I disagree wholly with the Minister's view. There is that other point of view which needs to be taken into account. Whether it is right to set it in tablets of stone in this way, rather than simply have a Secretary of State to decide, is debatable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman. The Secretary of State has to judge anyway. He is given
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0828">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>299</span>
that power by Parliament. This is not the only professional body that is dealt with by listing. Statute recognises the Law Society, the Bar Council and so this is not something that has suddenly descended upon us. These professional bodies have established themselves to the satisfaction of everybody as maintaining the highest standards of professional expertise and integrity. Of course, that is not to say that they are complacent about these matters and that they will continually seek to improve these affairs. Nevertheless we have to consider the matter from another point of view—that of the public at large. The public at large ought not to have this situation left in a vague unclarified state. They are now able to determine at once what the position is and I think that is wholly desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I have dealt with all the points that were made. I hope, therefore, that we shall be able to pass on to other matters and that the hon. Gentleman will feel it is appropriate to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the Minister to deal with the question of appeal. I am not certain whether Amendment No. 110, which deals with this recommendation, will be moved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ben Ford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case I will leave it to the Minister's discretion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shersby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his helpful reply. It is useful for the Committee to know that the British Association will not be debarred from recognition at a future date, when it is able to satisfy the Secretary of State that it is fulfilling the strict criteria of recognition to which he has referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to know that the Department is looking at the new syllabus which the association has put forward. I am interested to note the Under-Secretary's comment to the effect that he hopes the BAAA will be considering independent assessment of its standards and examinations. That is something that the association will want to take into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a useful debate. It places on record the view of the Government with regard to the association, its standards and the conditions which have to be fulfilled for recognition at a future date. Therefore,
	<span class='label label-info column'>300</span>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ben Ford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 110, in page 16, line 38, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2A)(a) If on the request of a body that it be added to subsection (1) above the Secretary of State refuses, or delays for a period exceeding six months, to comply with the request he shall, if required by that body, state in writing the reason for the refusal or delay, and the body may appeal to the Privy Council;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>b</i>)on any such appeal the Privy Council, after communication with the Secretary of State, may dismiss or uphold the appeal, and if the appeal is upheld the Secretary of State shall make regulations under this section to give effect thereto."</p></blockquote>
Before I address myself to the amendment may I ask my hon. Friend to comment on line 24 on page 16, where the word " company " appears. I wonder if there is a printing or literal error. Possibly it should read " companies."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the sake of better accuracy and brevity, I propose to stick fairly close to the notes that I have
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been stated, this is the first time that a list of approved recognised bodies has been included in statute, at least in company law. I refer, however, to the Local Government Act 1933 where a list of bodies was included. We could go back even further to the South Wales Water Board Act 1924, where certain bodies were included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to provide a machinery for ensuring that responsible representations made to the Secretary of State for the inclusion of a further accounting body in the list of qualified bodies are not only taken fully into consideration, and within a reasonable period, but are also seen to be subject to a method of adjudication in the event of an unfavourable decision by the Secretary of State. The amendment is in the interests of the Secretary of State as well as the appellant body, because it is important—and I believe doubly so in a matter of this nature—that justice should not only be done but should manifestly be seen to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The four bodies named in subsection (1) are eminently respectable bodies which have, for nearly 30 years, been recognised and accepted by the Secretary of State under the provisions of Section 161 of the Companies Act 1948, which the new procedure is designed in the first place to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0829">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>301</span>
consolidate. But the very fact that these four bodies have an entrenched status must of necessity make it more difficult for a new body to break the magic ring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any application by a new body to the Secretary of State must start with a disadvantage. Two major hurdles present themselves. First, there is the understandable difficulty of inducing the Secretary of State to introduce a new body. Secondly, it cannot be supposed that to introduce a fifth body would be welcome to the four which are fortunate enough to have the existing monopoly. In his anxiety to inquire fully into the question, it is inevitable that the Secretary of State should seek the reaction of at least some representatives of the four bodies, and that he has done in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would enable an appeal to be brought to the Privy Council. It follows, or is to some extent based on, Section 24(2) of the Medical Act 1952. The majority, if not all, of the enactments dealing with professional qualifications allow a right of appeal in matters affecting the right of a person to practise a profession, examples being found in the Architects (Registration) Act 1931, the Opticians Act 1958 and the Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act 1960.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend referring to members of those bodies who find themselves involved in disciplinary proceedings and ultimately have a right of appeal similar to that of solicitors, or is he suggesting that bodies as such have a right of appeal? I think the position has to be clarified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it applies to both—to members seeking registration and, in one of these cases, although I cannot be dogmatic on this, bodies seeking registration as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last two Acts—the Opticians Act 1958 and the Professions (Supplementary to Medicine) Act 1960—adopt the Privy Council as the appropriate appeal body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 24(2) of the Medical Act allows for an appeal against a refusal to register Commonwealth and foreign practitioners and enables the Privy Council to give a direction to the General Medical Council that an appellant be treated as having proved the matters in question. It is not part of the case for the amendment that there are foreign accountants in any
	<span class='label label-info column'>302</span>
particular body; indeed, there are such accountants in the presently qualified bodies, but Section 24(2) is merely followed as a precedent and as an analogy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the restrictive and monopoly aspects of the present system, there is a sense of grievance among certain bodies that the four qualified under the Companies Act are generally regarded as being professionally superior. That is not the case. The purpose of Section 161 has been to define the eligibility for appointment as an auditor to a company incorporated under the Companies Act. It is neither an assessment of competency, nor is it a barrier to the provision of accountancy services to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another matter. Overseas Governments apply recognition under Section 161 as a precedent for recognition within their own country in the belief that the section was introduced to define only reputable bodies of accountants. This, as will be clearly seen, places an incubus upon qualified accountants seeking appointments, or wishing to practise in those countries who are not members of the recognised bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a sense of frustration at the failure of the Secretary of State to nominate anynew body. One body has had full consultations with the Department, but its case has been under review for 29 years. It now feels that it has done all that can reasonably be done to meet the criteria to achieve the necessary recognition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hear a lot about the necessity for open government these days. I reiterate that I am attempting to assist my hon. Friend, and the Secretary of State, in order that justice can be seen to be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Lamond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment, suggesting an appeals machinery, should be closely looked at. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Ford) stated, it would lift a burden from the shoulders of the Secretary of State if there was a body to whom any dissatisfied applicant could appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am interested in these institutions, not only concerning chartered accountants but those of which I have some experience, in the engineering field. I do not have much experience of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England, Wales, Scotland or Ireland, but I imagine that they operate on similar principles to the Institution of Civil Engineers, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0830">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>303</span>
Institution of Heating and Ventilating Engineers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether hon. Members appreciate the enormous strength of those institutions which, in some respects, stem from the recognition given to them by Governments. For example, membership of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers is a qualification recognised by the Health Service as necessary for promotion to certain grades.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that the qualifications to become members of these bodies are set by the members themselves, so we can get into a rather vicious circle in some respects. For instance, if I may give an example without straying too far from the amendment—I certainly would not wish to do that, Mr. Crawshaw—in order to be promoted from one grade to another in the health service one must be a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. But to become a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers one must not merely have passed all the examinations and satisfied the Institution on the training that one has had; one must also have held a position of responsibility for a certain period of time. But it will not recognise the grade from which such a person would be promoted as a position of responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not proceed on these lines. Perhaps he could deal with auditors and make any relevant remarks on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Crawshaw, I was attempting to illustrate from my own experience—my experience of the Institute of Chartered Accountants being necessarily limited—the strength that these institutes have been given. I think that the Institute of Chartered Accountants probably enjoys the same strength from the same reasons, as I see it listed here. Because it is listed here, this strength is given to it—the same strength which in my opinion is misused by some of the other institutes and may, for all I know, be misused by these.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One asks oneself why it is necessary, for example, to have at least two further institutions concerned with accountants—the British Association of Accountants and Auditors, which was mentioned earlier, and the Association of International Auditors—when we have those
	<span class='label label-info column'>304</span>
already listed here in existence. I can understand why there are three. Being of Scots descent myself, I can understand why there is an institute covering England and Wales, an institute covering Scotland and an institute covering Ireland. I wonder a little why there is another one, the Association of Certified Accountants, and then two further groups at least who would wish to be on the list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the difference between these various associations or institutes? Is there some difference in their examinations, for example, or is there some difference in the qualifications which they require which may not be covered by examination, in the same way as I have just indicated that to become a member of the Institution of Heating and Ventilating Engineers, the Institution of Civil Engineers, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers or the Institution ofElectrical Engineers one has not only to pass examinations, which would suggest that if one passes them one has a certain competency in these disciplines, but also to satisfy the people who run these institutes that one has held a job with some responsibility for a certain period of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These other institutes that have tried to get on to the list and are trying to be recognised may not have exactly the same requirements that must be satisfied before one can join them. That may be the reason why there is a proliferation of these bodies. If that is the case, I am all for it. I think that it is wrong that an institute may be set up and start off, as many of them did, by actually advertising for members. I am going back many years, of course,but in the beginning they advertised for members, and obtained members on the basis that if one could pay the fee of £5 per year or whatever it was, one was in and one could add these letters to one's name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interesting thing is that over the years, and particularly in recent years, those who have become members and therefore have a considerable say in what the qualifications are before anybody else can join, have begun pulling the ladder up behind them and insisting on all sorts of further qualifications before membership can be obtained. We in government have strengthened their hand in doing this, in creating a monopoly, by passing legislation of this kind which is severely limiting the jobs that can be obtained by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0831">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>305</span>
people who for one reason or another are not acceptable to these institutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To have an appeals machinery is the least we can do. It would concentrate the mind of the Secretary of State on the ap- plications he receives. I believe that any Secretary of State probably has con-siderable advice on whether or not an institute should be accepted. Moreover, in the main, that advice probably comes from the members of the existing institutes. Certainly they have a vested interest in keeping the number of approved in- stitutes to a minimum. Naturally it will assist recruitment to their own institutes if they are in a monopoly position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just as I believe that there should be an appeals machinery within the institutes themselves—in many cases there is not, and the decision of the governing body is final—I believe that in this legislation, there should certainly be some method of appealing against the Secretary of State's decision so that at least we can see that these things have been looked at fairly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In replying to the debate on Amendment No. 87, the Under-Secretary mentioned some sort of test that was applied to these institutes, some criteria that they must meet about a fair number or a reasonable number of members having obtained membership by examination and so on. if we are really trying to make it absolutely plain to the general public that an auditor for a company is someone well qualified, perhaps we should print in the legislation not the names of institutes which are ac- ceptable, which I understand is being done for the first time, but the criteria that would be accepted by the Secretary of State as having qualified a person to be an auditor. That would really make the matter plain. I therefore ask the Minister whether the criteria applied in the Department to an application are readily available to those who make applications so that they can find out why they have been turned down and do something about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am inclined to support the amendment moved by my hon. Friend on the basis that I at least want to see this whole matter opened up much more to the public eye, so that we can be quite sure that the position with these institutes—which, after all, are quite outside the control of the Government but which the Government use, as we see in this legislation—is seen to be fair and that if there is something lacking which can be met perhaps by
	<span class='label label-info column'>306</span>
adding another name to the list, that will be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Ford) is to be congratulated on his initiative in bringing forward this amendment. Certainly it seems right and important for the longterm outcome of this legislation that there should be some system of appeal. Certainly any body applying to have its name added to the list should have a statement in writing of the reasons for any refusal or delay. It is also right that there should be some complete system of appeal, even to the extent of going over the head of the Secretary of State as the amendment does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who can feel that these bodies will be perfect for all time? They make their own regulations; they are self-continuing; they appoint their own people, and one cannot help feeling that over the years their ideas may have become dogmatic even to the point where it becomes an act of impiety to question their rules and regulations. In medicine, for example, history shows that in advances with antiseptics or anaesthetics it was not the professional bodies which led the advance but those outside them, and it may be so with accountants, particularly in anage where there is the rapid introduction of new machinery and processes. I hope, therefore, that the Government will give the hon. Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Ford) some assurances that they will bring in a system of appeal, and if not, that they will accept his amendment in the precise form in which it is tabled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may deal first with the small point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Ford) on the question of the words in brackets. The phrase in brackets is merely a description of Section 161(1)(a). It has no statutory significance and traditionally is in shorthand or note form. However, I will decide whether the matter needs further clarification. There is no problem about an amendment on this point, but I do not think it would be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An appeal from a Government department to the Privy Council on a matter of this character would be wholly unprecedented. I am not saying that in itself that is an argument for rejecting it, but I must put the record straight. It is the Secretary of State who has the duty under
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0832">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>307</span>
the 1948 Act to limit auditing to bodies which are recognised by him. That followed the CohenReport. It is an administrative decision. The Secretary of State must deal with the administrative decisions affecting the Companies Acts and with relations between the Government and the accountancy profession as a whole. The Privy Council cannot possibly have such a decision within its expertise. It is responsible for the issue of Royal Charters and for the approval of amendments to these documents. The Privy Council, when faced with disputes arising from such applications, has itself to seek advice from the Government Department relevant to the area of the application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Amendment No. 110 were passed, the Privy Council would have to seek advice from the Department of Trade concerning appeals arising from the Department of Trade. I therefore cannot see how this would be consistent with an independent review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recognition of bodies for audit purposes is essentially an administrative matter and not a judicial matter. We are dealing here with bodies. This is what the amendment refers to. It is not dealing with individuals; it is dealing with the organisations. It is difficult to seehow any system of independent appeals could work effectively in view of the expert knowledge and advice which is necessary to judge any specific case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend said that the listing of a new body would be unwelcome to the other four. I thought I had given some token of good faith on behalf of the Government which was accepted by the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Shersby) in his concluding remarks about how we approach the matter. My hon. Friend is not justified in stigmatising the way in which the Department of Trade approaches this sort of situation. I have spelt out that the criteria are not fulfilled at the moment. I cannot agree with him when he says that the BAAA—he did not mention it by name, but that was the organisation to which he was clearly referring—has done all it reasonably can to meet the criteria.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I gave my hon. Friend that impression, but I was not referring to that organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot deal with a situation which is not made explicit. If my

hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may help my hon. Friend, it is a body with an application currently before theDepartment. I did not seek to imply that the application was not being dealt with properly bythe Department.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member refers to somebody having had an application in for 29 years.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it would be helpful if the body could be identified. I shall have to move on from this. I know of no such body that has had an application in for 29 years, and has been not dealt with by a succession of Governments through some form of default.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I turn to the serious point which has become confused—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I raise this point in passing, but it is rather important. If the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins). It may be that my hon. Friend has a very good reason for not wishing to advert to the matter more publicly on this occasion. I do not know whether my hon. Friend is alluding to the Association of International Accountants, that has made a number of applications which have been rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see that my hon. Friend is asserting that that is the case. There is an application before the Department at the moment. But my understanding is that the ball is in the court of the association, as it has been asked to carry out an assessment of certain matters.I do not think it would be helpful if I were to go further into that, because it is under consideration at the moment. All I want to say is that it has had a number of applications rejected. Mr. Ford: In connection with this application which has now been mentioned, I was seeking not to exercise any special pleading on behalf of this body. That is why I did not wish to mention its name in this place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it was asked to appoint moderators in order to assess its examination. The Department supplied four names and one would have thought that the Department would have ascertained the views of those whose names it supplied before passing them to the international association. In fact, two of those moderators have refused and one finds this difficult to understand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not going to debate an issue which is currently being considered by the Department, because it would invite me to offer a prejudgment on a matter in which I have not been involved. If I have, I cannot recall it. I will take note of what my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Lamond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This matter was raised by the Under-Secretary himself. My hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals with the question of appeal machinery—nothing to do with the institute. I wish to make it clear that my support for my hon. Friend's amendment is that we are dealing with appeals machinery that can be used by anyone who makes an application—not this specific application.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to reply to a point which was made. I thought my hon. Friend was referring to the BAAA because

he had not mentioned a specific body. He said that a body had done all it reasonably could to meet the criteria of the Department. I was seeking to meet that point. My hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, East (Mr. Lamond) is being rather unfair. I know it is uncharacteristic—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is not so much the question of an appeal affecting a body which is important; it is a question whether natural justice can be afforded to individuals within professional bodies. As I understand the position, it is the right of any person who has been refused admission or has been disciplined by a professional body, whether of accountants or solicitors, to apply to the High Court for a prerogative order. It is not a question of administrative decision by the Secretary of State in any shape or form. But there is clearly a legal channel through which people can seek to obtain a remedy if there has been a serious deficiency in the way in which procedures are applied by professional bodies. There is no doubt about that.

My hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, East suggested that the professional bodies listed in the Bill might be as deficient as certain other professional bodies in respect of which he exercised a good deal of suspicion. I do not think, with respect, that that is the right way to approach the matter. In fairness to the bodies concerned, they have applied high standards affecting admission, regulation and discipline of their profession. None of those professional bodies is beyond criticism, but it is wrong to stigmatise them because my hon. Friend may have had some unfortunate dealings with some other professional organisation.

I thought I had already dealt, on the previous amendment, with the reason why we list them. The essence of it is that they satisfy the criteria that satisfy the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of State is specifically deputed by Parliament to deal with this area of the
law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

professional body has a sufficiently acceptable method of discipline within itself to determine issues affecting admission, examination, regulation of the profession, discipline, and so on. Not only the present Secretary of State, but successive Secretaries of State, in fulfilment of the duty imposed upon him, had to consider the position with regard to these bodies.
