<p>No. 11, in page 10, line 9, leave out '£300 ' and insert '£250 '.</p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suppose I could start on a note of agreement by suggesting that of all the figures which we shall discuss on this schedule the one which we are now discussing and the one relating to preference for creditors in respect of wages are probably the two most important. They are figures of great importance for a lot of people.<br><br>
In a way, the timing has been fortunate, because it has given me the opportunity, since we began this debate, to read and consider the detail of what the Minister said both in his speeches on Clause 1, which set the background to what we are now discussing, and in his contribution on this amendment. I want to begin by suggesting to him, with respect, that he has quite misunderstood our purpose.<br><br>
Our purpose is to find out why it is said that£300 is the right figure. At the end of the day, it is a matter of judgment, and this Committee will have to form a judgment, just as the officials who prepared the Bill formed a judgment and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
just as, we are prepared to assume, the Minister himself formed an independent judgment. But what has to happen is that this Committee has to form a judgment. It cannot form that judgment unless it has full information on all relevant factors to enable it to balance one against the other.<br><br>
We could have obtained most of that information simply by tabling one amendment. It would not have mattered what figure we put in; it would have raised all these issues. But the Committee could reach agreement on this: there are only three possibilities for this figure. They are£300, which the Government have chosen,£200 which is the figure put forward by the Law Society and all others who have made outside representations, so far as we know, or £250. That being so, having tabled amendments which have the effect of giving this Committee the choice of those three figures—the only three which can be on the cards—we can in this Committee investigate the matter thoroughly and consider what would be the position if we took any one of those figures. It is to that that my observations are now directed.<br><br>
Again, still on a note of agreement—. I think we have reached agreement about this—there are two sides to the discussion about this figure. One side is the importance of bankruptcy as a remedy to debtors who cannot otherwise get their money. Accepting that proposition entails accepting that there has been a change in the role of bankruptcy since the first Bankruptcy Act, when it was not intended primarily, or even to a large extent, to be a remedy for debt collecting. But one can say that for a long time now everybody, including the Lord Chancellor's Department, as he claimed in the speech with which he introduced the Bill, has accepted that not only is that one of his major roles but that it has now become one of the very best methods of obtaining money that might not otherwise be obtained. The Minister accepted that. But I suggest to him that he has got the emphasis wrong. He went quite a long way with me—I am obliged to him for that—in my proposition that the other remedies available to creditors have been seriously eroded over the last 10 years.<br><br>
Having studied again what he said about this side of the matter on Tuesday,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0986">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 57</span>
I want to put this to him. Yes, some remedies are still left, and it is a matter of judgment what value they are. I suggest to him that the terms in which he described them on Tuesday gave them greater value than is justified. He referred to judgment summonses. Yes, there are a great many, but I understand that they do not have nearly the same effect now as they used to have, when at the end of the road there was always the possibility of an order for imprisonment.<br><br>
I go back about the same length of time as the hon. Gentleman does, perhaps a little longer, to the time when I sat in court whilst hundreds of judgment summonses were dealt with before the judge got to the list. I remember that a great many of them went through very quickly, and then there was the hard core in which the judge was being asked to make an order for imprisonment. It always used to be said then that, once the order for imprisonment was made, it had a magical effect on a large proportion of the debtors, and few of them went to prison. It is necessary to recognise that though the judgment summons procedure is still available, it has nothing like the same value as it had before the abolition of imprisonment for debt.<br><br>
I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman was serious about it or just pulling the legs of the laymen when he talked about garnishee and charging orders. The sort of person I am talking about has no idea what garnishee means, which is a good reason why it is not likely to arise in the collection of any of the sort of debts about which we are talking. Yes, the procedure still exists. I have been in practice 25 years now, and I have seen two garnishee orders. One is just lucky when one happens to obtain the information necessary to found a garnishee order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terence Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I hesitate to interrupt my hon. and learned Friend, but as I have not been in practice at all, and I suspect that that is also true of other members of the Committee, I think we should have a brief outline of what a garnishee order is. The Minister did not explain it either.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was afraid someone might ask that. I will not say that I do not wish to answer my hon. Friend's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
question, but we have a great many other things to get on with so I will leave it to the Minister to explain, if he persists in his view that it is of any value. If he joins me in thinking that it is of the most limited value, we can drop it. The idea that the sort of person I was talking about would receive a charging order on somebody's land or shares for the purpose of executing the judgment debt which comes from the county court is equally impracticable. So, yes, those remedies exist, but, no, they are of no real value in this context.<br><br>
We are talking about bankruptcies in respect of debts of less than£300. The hon. Gentleman spoke about attachment of earnings. That helps, but the Law Society has put it to us that one category of creditor has virtually no hope at all, and that is the creditor whose debt is for less than £1,000. If he goes to the High Court he will, at best, get county court costs, and that will come of his judgment. Or, if the amount is low enough, he may get no costs at all unless he goes to the county court, so he has to go to the county court. He gets his judgment, but it so happens that the debtor is self-employed so the attachment of earnings procedure does not help. Yes, the bailiff can be sent along, but if the debtor will not let the bailiff in, the bailiff just comes back and says " No dice".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Clinton Davis)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. and learned Gentleman will find that the point he is making will to some extent be tackled in a later provision of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is my next point—administration orders. The Minister referred to these, and I am limiting myself now to what he has said in response to what I said in the same field. He referred to the availability of administration orders. As a practitioner, he will know that the proof of the pudding is in the eating. If there is a good method of collecting a judgment debt, solicitors will be clamouring to use it. It is plain common sense that they should. The number of times in a year that any solicitor has chosen to use this procedure represents but a minute proportion of the total number of cases in which it was available, and one must infer from that that they have made a value judgment, based on experience, that it is not worth the candle.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0987">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 59</span>
I can tell the Minister one reason why an administration order is inferior to bankruptcy. It is because those who have to carry out an administration order have nothing like the same expertise or facilities for getting at assets as have those who carry out the necessary steps in a case of bankruptcy. I will give just one instance. Very often now, those who want to collect money owed to them see a whole lot of furniture in a house and they are told that it belongs to the man's wife, not to him; or they see a car, they are told that it belongs to the company.<br><br>
The law is not such an ass as to take all those answers and sit down. Under the bankruptcy laws, steps are available to those who have to administer the laws for setting aside transactions made in defeat of creditors, for setting aside preferences, preferring someone to a creditor. There are much greater facilities for finding out what assets there are and what assets can be tracked down, the public examination being the classic example of that. None of these is available to those who have to carry out an administration order, and I suggest to the Minister that the administration order procedure is second-rate compared with the procedure available to a debtor if he can pray in aid the bankruptcy procedure
In saying that, I mean no disrespect to those who have to carry out administration orders. It is simply that we have not given them either the legal powers or the facilities to make a job of it. I know this administration order business stems back to the Payne Report. What we have done is to implement little bits of the Payne Report and say that this was all recommended by the Payne Committee, forgetting that what was recommended by the Payne Committee was a package—a package which entailed the setting up of a new course to carry out these administration orders effectively. We have purported to accept the spirit of it; we have taken little bits of it; but we have not given those who have the job of carrying out an administration order the facilities to do so. Compared with bankruptcy, an administration order is very much a second-class service, and I think the Minister knows it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I wonder whether the hon. and learned Gentleman is not making a speech now which might be more appropriate to Clause 8.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, Mr. English. What I am doing now may save me doing it again on Clause 8. I have looked carefully at what the Minister said on the amendment. He accepts that diminution in the number and effect of remedies available is relevant to the figure we are now discussing. In answer to my points on that, he said, " Oh, but we have got the administration orders ", and you will recall that he intervened earlier this morning to draw my attention to Clause 8. I have not referred to Clause 8 yet; I am merely referring to what is available at the moment, and I suggest to the Minister that he has overstated, in his argument on this amendment, the importance of existing administration orders. It follows from that that, when we get to Clause 8, I shall say that to increase the availability of a remedy which is not of itself of much value does not add much to what is available to creditors.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
Stick to what we have already—the ability to go to the county court and ask for an administration order—has proved to be of little value, largely for the reasons on which I have touched so briefly.<br><br>
Finally, if one is thinking of substituting an administration order for bankruptcy, one is definitely thinking of substituting a second-class for a first-class service. As the Minister knows, this is the fundamental fear felt and expressed by the Law Society, the Bar Council and all those who practise in this field. They greatly admire the service which is at present provided and those who administer it. But they are seriously concerned that what is proposed here is to substitute for that existing first-class service a second-class service. If it is to be inferred that the Minister sees the administration order as a substitute for bankruptcy proceedings, that gives strength to their fears.<br><br>
I turn now to the other side of the coin. Everybody agrees with what I have said, that a first-class service is provided. Everybody agrees that it is one of a diminishing number of remedies available. So then one comes to the other side. Why make it less available? That is the effect of raising the figure to £300. The answer which the Government give is that it is necessary to halt the rising burden on the service and to reduce public expenditure. If I am wrong, perhaps
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0988">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 61</span>
the Minister would tell me now, but take it that, in calculating the reduction of the burden on the service and the reduction in public expenditure as the result of the Bill, he is speaking in terms of calculations that apply to the Bill as a whole—to the whole of the package presented by the Bill. I thought he would indicate that that is so; it must be so, otherwise it would not make sense. I am all for saving public money, but let us make sure that we do not save that small proportion of it that is spent on very useful purposes. We are in danger of doing that here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Raymond Gower</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. and learned Friend leaves that point, would he not agree that, taking the figure in the old Acts, which I think he has conceded has become quite unrealistic, bankruptcies and liquidations in recent years have been obtaining at figures which were never contemplated when the earlier Acts were passed. For that reason alone, the Government have justification for up-rating the figure. Is that not the case?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right. That is what we have all accepted from the start of the Committee and in the Second Reading debate. Of course the figure must go up. The question we have to decide in this Committee is up to what it must go. It is even simpler than that. We have to consider whether it should go up to £200, £250 or £300, the conflicting views at the moment being that from the Ministry comes the judgment that it should be £300 and from the profession the judgment that it should be £200. My purpose now is to examine those figures and ask for information relating to each of them which will enable us, against the background that I have tried to set, to judge what is the proper balance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. and learned Gentleman develops his argument further, he has to address himself not simply to a fault in—as he put it—the rising burden of the service and a reduction of public expenditure, but also to a third parameter—avoiding increase in public expenditure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, and even in my hurried observations on Tuesday I made it clear that I had that in mind. I will now, however, make it perfectly
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
clear what I think are the relevant factors on which we seek information.<br><br>
If we are to be able to reach a value judgment, as distinct from simply picking a figure out of the air, we have to know the answers to the following questions. They should not present much difficulty, because I have assumed that they have been considered by those who have put them forward.<br><br>
First, what assessments have been made of the increase in the burden to date? I realise that even to get up-to-date figures involves an estimation, because I do not suppose for a moment that full and precise figures are available right up to date.<br><br>
Next, what estimate has been made of the increase in the number of bankruptcies if we did not put up the limit? If I may for a moment put at risk the amiability of this Committee, I think that a generous allowance should be made for the likelihood of an increase in the number of bankruptcies so long as the present Government continue in their present economic policies. What increase have the Government allowed for and what increase in the service or in the number of court officials would be required to service that number of bankruptcies if we did nothing? That is the starting-point.<br><br>
Then, what do we do to reduce that number? The first way is by putting up the deposit. That is what is proposed at the moment, because this is a package, and this is why it is not possible to take any of these items in isolation. What estimate has been made of the reduction in the number of bankruptcies which will be brought about by putting up the deposit from£5 and£7.50 to£50 and£90 respectively?<br><br>
I emphasise those figures, because it seems to me that that is much more than simply indexing them. They are being put up by a figure proportionately greater than some of the other figures, and presumably the reason is to discourage people from presenting petitions. The first thing we should like to know, therefore, is what estimate is made of the reduction which will be brought about by doing simply that. Only in addition to that do we have to consider the reduction that would be effected by putting up the price.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0989">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
Next, to what extent was it estimated that raising the limit to£300 would reduce the size and cost of the service? There are two elements to that. The first is a reduction in the number of bankruptcies, and we must know about that if we are to form a reasonable judgment. It would also be interesting to know, from this point of view, how many cases in which bankruptcy proceedings would otherwise have been used will be stopped by this increase. We should then have a much better idea of how many people will be deprived of this remedy. We could then weigh it in the balance that way as well.<br><br>
I appreciate that it is not simply a question of the number of bankruptcies that will be prevented from taking place because of this increase—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. and learned Gentleman think that he is repeating almost exactly what he said at the beginning of his speech last Tuesday?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think I am, Mr. English. If you will bear with me in what I am saying now, it would not be the first time somebody had repeated something in a Committee. What I am doing now is putting it into its context and adding qualifications which I did not have time to add at that stage and which make the questions more realistic and, I may even say, more fair to the Government. If you compare the two arguments, Mr. English, you will see that it is not simply repetition. I am trying to put the whole proposition as one.<br><br>
It is not just a question of a reduction in the number of bankruptcies. Some estimates, no doubt, have been made of the relative amount of work in small ones and big ones and the relative cost to service them. I know that I did not say this before. We have heard a good deal about the expense of bankruptcies to the public. What we have not heard about is the expense of bankruptcy to the creditor. It is an expensive business from the creditor's point of view, and so creditors do not persist in bankruptcy proceedings when it becomes apparent that there are no assets. That is a built-in safeguard against bankruptcy proceedings being continued simply for the sake of it. It is considerations of that sort
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
which must be relevant to whether£300 is right.<br><br>
I think that I have given a fuller and fairer version of them than I was able to do on Tuesday. If I have left out any factor which the Government think has to be brought in to make it accurate and fair, no doubt the Minister will tell us. Will he give us the information relevant both to the£300 limit and also to a£250 and£200 limit, so that we can form our judgment?<br><br>
One other factor has not been referred to by anyone. It entails a necessary reference to a later part of the Bill. When I started this part of my speech I said that I assumed that the Minister was talking about an increased burden on the public service and a saving of public money, and that he was referring to the whole package represented by the Bill. As the Bill stands, Clause 6 would call for a review by the court of every bankruptcy after a period of five years. That would entail a great deal more work for the service.<br><br>
The Committee will remember that the Blagden Committee in 1957 considered similar suggestions made by the two previous committees in the 1920s. It said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The difficulty "—</p></blockquote>
of such a proposition, that is, a review of every case—
<br><blockquote><p>"was that, if every bankrupt were to be brought before the Court for the consideration of his discharge, it would increase the costs of discharge administration fourfold, so that the recommendation of the 1924 Committee to the effect that every bankrupt should have his discharge considered by the Court was never carried out."</p></blockquote>
In the Bill it is proposed that some similar procedure should be introduced. Presumably the extra cost of that was taken into account in working out the reduction of the burden upon the service and the reduction of public expenditure. We understood from the Minister earlier this week that the Government did not propose to persist in the proposal. If I understood correctly what the Minister told us on Monday, they very reasonably accepted the arguments put to them by practitioners in this field and proposed to substitute for that a form of discharge which will be largely automatic and will cut out the expense of all these reviews.<br><br>
If that is so, that change will effect a big saving. If that saving is to be effective,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0990">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 65</span>
does that not enable us to go below the£300 limit and possibly down to the£250 limit, if not even down to the£200 limit? We would end up with the same overall package which the Government presumably decided could be afforded and should be provided.<br><br>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
The purpose of these amendments is to obtain for the Committee the information necessary to make a judgment. We do not have that information. I have tried to set out the main heads on which we would still like to know what assesments have been made. Only then can we form the judgment which we must form as to which of these figures would be most appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) has posed, as he did at the conclusion of the last sitting, a number of questions which I will endeavour to answer in the main part of the remarks that I want to make to the Committee this morning on this amendment.<br><br>
In the initial part of his remarks, however, he touched on matters that he had covered in previous debates concerning, as he put it, the wrong emphasis that the Government had made with regard to the diminution of the efficacy of bankruptcy proceedings coupled with the diminution in the efficacy of other means of enforcement of debt.<br><br>
I did not seek to say at the last sitting that we had a situation affecting the enforcement of debts in other respects for which respective individual remedies provided a remarkable form of redress to creditors. All I sought to say was that, imperfect though those remedies were, there were a number of them and it is wrong not to have regard to that factor when considering the issues of principle raised by the hon. and learned Gentleman.<br><br>
I do not think that I ought to be drawn by the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) into a discussion about the value of garnishee proceedings. I notice that his hon. and learned Friend was anxious to avoid implicating himself in any definition of that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was only anxious to save time.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had not noticed that about the hon. Gentleman's remarks generally, but perhaps if we had embarked on that we should have been sitting for a very long time. To give the hon. Gentleman a resume of the position on garnishee proceedings which is not now, as his hon. Friend said, a remedy pursued by the ordinary rank and file creditor, so to speak, any person who gets a judgment for the payment of money can take proceedings to obtain payment of the debt from a third party. It is often recourse to a bank account that is sought.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman allow me?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to go on with that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, we cannot have a situation where, in considering the alternatives to these matters, the Minister trots out a certain highly technical expression which he says is one of the possible alternatives. On behalf of the innocent layman, if he does that kind of thing, I must insist that he spells it out. If the matter is trivial, the least he could have done was to point that out at the time. He cannot say that we do not have to alter the limits in the way we are suggesting because there are other alternatives and then, when asked what it is all about, say that it is all trivial. That is not a satisfactory way of proceeding.<br><br>
We shall let the matter pass now because we do not want to delay the Committee, but I hope that he will not do it again because there will be many technical matters in the Bill which will not be immediately apparent to the layman. We must therefore rely on the Minister, when he puts forward an argument to say whether it has any real significance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member makes heavy weather of that point too. I am not here to offer a seminar in the methods of debt enforcement. The hon. Gentleman has access to county court and High Court practice. If he is not familiar with it, that is not my fault and I cannot waste the Committee's time by going into all these matters in detail. The information is available for him. Whether he wants to take advantage of it is a matter for him.<br><br>

I said—and I have now said it on a number of occasions—that none of the remedies by themselves is wholly perfect. I have said that, and just a moment ago before his intervention I said that the garnishee remedy, although available theoretically, is not available practically speaking to the ordinary creditor. Certainly, I have no experience of its being used widely. In my professional practice it was used—I have used it—but not on any extensive scale.<br><br>
I do not think, however, that the remarks about the inadequacy of the judgment summons procedure made by the hon. Gentleman are wholly right. An enormous number of judgment summonses is issued and heard in the county courts. County courts spend a whole morning perhaps once or twice a week dealing with nothing else but these instalment orders that arise under judgment summonses. Again, it is not a wholly perfect remedy, but it has to be looked at in its proper context.<br><br>
So far as the administration order is concerned, I said last time—I was not in any way not being open with the Committee—that it was not a remedy of which practitioners were wholly aware. I admit my own ignorance in this matter. I have never used it in practice and I do not know of my firm ever using this practice. I have spoken to practitioners and they have never even heard of it. Clearly, there is a defect there. If we are to use the procedure and try to make it more effective, there is a burden not only upon the Government and not only on the Law Society but on everybody connected with the enforcement of effective legal procedures to ensure that this procedure becomes more widely known. That is something to which we clearly have to give attention.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman went on to postulate the considerations—the criteria—which affected his judgment of the way in which the Opposition look upon the Bill. He asked a number of questions which are not easy to answer, because he presupposes that we can take the insolvency service and require it to carry out the most detailed analyses of the effects of a wide variety of permutations. That involves the service in time and expense. I have already indicated—I will continue to indicate more clearly—the burdens it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
already suffers from without having to take that additional work on board.<br><br>
There has been an analysis carried out; of course, there has. It does not cover all the points made by the hon. and learned Gentleman. It was an examination which took some three weeks early in 1975. I acknowledge that it did not cover£200 and£250. But, on the basis of the evidence which I shall produce in a moment, I would not be justified in asking the insolvency service to scrutinise closely all the permutations to which the hon. and learned Gentleman referred.<br><br>
There are two things to be said before I embark on providing the Committee with this evidence. First, it is a matter of balance of judgment. The hon. and learned Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke) emphasised that in his contribution at the last sitting. People who are expert in their testimony here—or most experts—must be those who have to deal with bankruptcy every single day of their lives. That is what they are there for, and what they are paid for. Those are the officials in the insolvency service who guide me.<br><br>
I am not saying for one moment that the views of the Law Society and of Justice are to be ignored. They are not to be ignored, but they do not have that everyday involvement in the practical affairs of bankruptcy on the same scale as those of my officials. I am not saying that my officials are necessarily right. I do not always agree with everything that is put to me. I should like to assure the Committee about that. I hope that no Minister would take that point of view.<br><br>
Having said that, I now come to the specific matters raised by the hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) both today and during our last sitting. The first principle on which we have acted is to restore monetary limits to the value which they should have today, having regard to the sort of monetary limits which still exist today and which were established in 1914.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) said, I think at the last sitting, many people feel that on the£300 limit we should have gone further and said£600. He himself might even by sympathetic to that point of view. But because of the erosion of the value of this monetary limit, creditors generally have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0992">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
become accustomed to using bankruptcy notices as part of the armoury for debt collection in a way not originally contemplated. It was originally contemplated that it was a necessary preliminary step to commencing bankruptcy proceedings. Now, five-sixths of the bankruptcy notices issued are used as a threat of bankruptcy proceedings, a threat which may or may not be taken seriously.<br><br>
It is not always taken seriously, because it is not always a necessary consequence that, if a creditor issues a bankruptcy notice, he will actually put somebody into bankruptcy One has to recognise here again a whole variety of possibilities that exist and are practised by creditors and by those advising them.<br><br>
Clearly, this was not the intention of the 1914 Act. Notwithstanding that, we took the view that it would be unwise to enforce so radical a change as increasing the limit to£600. We therefore arrived at£300 as the most acceptable compromise of the conflicting interests involved. Calculations were made to ascertain the resultant reduction in bankruptcy cases. But I say at once to the hon. and learned Gentleman that if he wants me to, if he is not satisfied today with my recounting a lot of statistics and with what he sees in the <i>Official Report,</i> we can enter into correspondence and I can provide him with a chart to enable him to see how these figures are made up. It is not easy to present a chart to a Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a perfectly reasonable approach. I am glad that we shall hear some figures, and of course we shall consider them. We may wish to reserve our position and follow up the details with the Minister. That is a perfectly reasonable suggestion in this context.</span></p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The calculations were made to see what resultant reduction in bankruptcy cases might be expected. An analysis of 5,489 receiving orders was made in 1973–74. This analysis showed that 1,242 cases were founded on petitions up to£300, 730 on petitions for £301 to£600, and 1,503 cases on petitions of over£600. That made a total of 3,475 creditors' petitions. In addition, 2,014 cases were founded on debtors' petitions, and I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
will refer to the difficulty of judgment about these matters in relation to debtors' petitions in a few moments.<br><br>
Raising the monetary limit for the minimum debt for petition would not necessarily have wipedout all the cases where the petition debt was under£300 or£600 respectively, because in some cases the debtors themselves might have presented petitions, and in others creditors might have joined together to present petitions. It was assumed, however, that all the smaller cases would have been wiped out. That had to be assumed for the purpose of arriving at a reasonable analysis, although there is therefore an area of uncertainty. Further calculations showed that these smaller cases with assets under£300 represented 72 per cent. of the total in both debtors' and creditors' petitions. To sow the estimated reduction in the number of bankruptcies, if the minimum debt had been increased, I must allude to a chart, which I shall translate as best I can.<br><br>
If the minimum debt had been£300, the reduction in cases would have been 894, or 72 per cent. of the 1,242 cases founded on petitions up to£300. The percentage of cases based on a creditor's petition was 26 per cent., and the percentage of total bankruptcy cases, 16 per cent. It is the last figure that is importan—an estimated 16 per cent, of all bankruptcy cases. As I have already indicated, this is not absolutely clear or satisfactory, but it is of that order.<br><br>
If the minimum debt had been£600, the reduction in cases would have been 1,420–72 per cent. of the total figure of 1,972, 41 per cent. of cases based on creditors' petitions, and—the most important percentage—26 per cent. of total bankruptcy cases. If we look at the situation purely in terms of logic, and leave aside the other considerations to which both the hon. and learned Gentleman and I have referred, there would have been a 26 per cent. saving.<br><br>
Applying these same percentages to the 1975 bankruptcy cases would have resulted in a reduction of 1,180 if the limit had been£300. and a reduction of 1,864 if the limit had been£600, out of a total of 4,546 cases founded on creditors' petitions.<br><br>
I come now to the debtors' petitions, which are altogether more difficult and less susceptible to analysis. There is no
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0993">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
real way to calculate the likely result of raising the deposit on petitions. It is probable, however, that the debtor would be deterred from paying a high deposit in small cases, although he might be able to borrow a deposit from a friend or relative, or somebody with whom he had been on relatively amicable terms in business; but on the assumption that he would be so deterred—that is to say, the most favourable calculation of deterrence—the reduction in the cases analysed would have been 72 per cent. of 2,014—that is to say, 1,450—representing 26 per cent. of the total bankruptcies. But it is likely that the reduction would have been limited to bankruptcies where the assets were less than£100, and these amounted to only 38 per cent. of 2,014. I can see there is a difficulty in that area and that it is not easily susceptible to complete analysis.<br><br>
Having tried to present the evidence reasonably fairly to the hon. Gentleman—I hope that he will look at it carefully—I hope he will come to the conclusion that I have done more than make out just a <i>prima facie</i> case on the basis of the figures to which I have alluded. I cannot really insist that a massive further analysis is undertaken by the insolvency service. It has started to look at the position but without any time limit being imposed, because it wants to see what sort of projections it can make itself.<br><br>
As far as staff is concerned, in 1975, when the calculations were made concerning the workload reductions which were expected to flow from the proposals which I am now putting to the Committee, the manpower implications were that over the three years following the Bill coming into force there would be a reduction of 100 to 150 in the number of clerical and executive staff then employed in the insolvency service. That would have been a saving in expenditure of up to£750,000 a year. However, in addition, the insolvency service had then—the position has now worsened—in post only about one-half of the specialist staff required to cope with the number of bankruptcies and company liquidations which it was under a statutory duty to deal with. I gave those figures last time, as the Committee will remember.<br><br>
The reduction in cases which was expected to result from the Bill would, the Department hoped, have meant that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
this shortfall of specialist staff would not all need to have been recruited. But since that time, the workload of the insolvency service has continued to rise, with the result that there is now also a shortfall of about 100 in the number of clerical and executive staff needed to cope with it. I will not be deflected into making observations of a political nature which the hon. Gentleman thought it appropriate to do.<br><br>
Until the load falls from its present abnormal level, therefore, the number of clerical and executive staff which will be saved as a result of the provisions of the Bill may only be about 50. It is calculated, as I said before, that there will be a reduction of 16 per cent. ln. the total number of receiving orders, as a result of increasing the limit to£300 and raising the deposit on a creditor's petition to£90 and on a debtor's petition to£50. But it is difficult, because this is not a procedure which we have had an opportunity of seeing working in practice. We shall carefully monitor the position and see how it operates.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman missed one of the points about the increase in the deposit. It is not simply a deterrent, although it is intended to have that effect. It is also the case, as, again Ipointed out during one of our previous debates, that the mainly domestic and consumer credit cases of a fairly small kind at present yield insufficient even to meet the costs of the petition. That is a factor that must be taken into account, otherwise there will be a continuing substantial loss as far as those matters are concerned. That is also an important reason for increasing the deposit along the lines we have suggested and for taking it out of step with the other increases in the monetary limits to which I have referred.<br><br>
The average cost to the insolvency service of dealing with a bankruptcy in 1974 was£762, against which the service received an average of£108 a case fee income and£171 a case investment income. We have to deal with this position and it is very critical.<br><br>
Having regard to the difficulties of the burdens imposed upon a depleted staff, having regard to the increased burdens which have necessarily arisen from this abnormal situation through which we are going, having regard to the necessity, in any event, to increase the monetary
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0994">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 73</span>
limits from an eroded position, I hope the Committee will feel that I have made out a case that, on a balance of judgment,£300 represents a reasonable figure and that the£200 or£250 are only inspired guesses, and that the best advice, information and evidence come from those who have to deal with the everyday functioning of this vital service so that both creditors and debtors can best be advantaged by an efficient operation of the service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I, first, take up the point I made in an intervention, and to which the Minister replied, on the principle involved in the exchanges we have had on garnishee proceedings? The situation is quite simple. The Minister was asked what the alternatives are to the procedures which we are now debating and what effect the limit will have on those proceedings. He listed a number of possibilities, including this particular one, using a highly technical expression.<br><br>
It would be reasonable for the non-expert members of the Committee to assume that that was a sensible argument and of some significance. It is not right that the assumption on which Standing Committees are based is that we are all lawyers. We are most certainly not all lawyers. Therefore, for the Minister, when I ask him to explain this, to turn round and say that we have access to the county court this and the county court that is totally unreasonable. However, what is much more unreasonable is that he should trot out this argument which, when he is pressed upon it, turns out to be an alternative not available, practically speaking, to ordinary creditors.<br><br>
We are concerned here mainly with ordinary creditors. I am sure I should be out of order if I used the expression "dishonest argument", so I shall not use it, but it was an argument which ought to have been put in perspective by the Minister when he originally raised the matter. We did not raise the garnishee proceedings—he did, and he should have put it in perspective at that time rather than wait until he is pressed upon it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must intervene here. On a technical Bill lawyers are, perhaps, a little more familiar with technical terms, although none of us, as lawyers on this Committee, is an expert
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 74</span>
in bankruptcy—in practice, of course; the theory is all there.<br><br>
Does the hon. Gentleman expect us to provide a glossary of every technical term that emerges in a Bill put before a Committee? Of course he does not, and it is not a serious argument. He has a lawyer upon whom he is able to rely; that is one of the reasons why he has advice from his hon. and learned Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With great respect to the Minister, this is not the point. I am not asking for a glossary of technical terms, but I expect that when the Minister uses a technical term he at least qualifies it to the extent that those of us who are not familiar with it—there is no reason why we should be familiar with it in any great detail—are not misled by his use of it. If he uses a technical term, the onus is upon him to explain it. In the same way, if I were using a technical, economic term, I should not expect everyone in the Committee necessarily to understand it. I should certainly feel it appropriate to spell it out. I should not use a technical term in a way likely to mislead the Committee. I shall not pursue the point any further, but, with great respect to the Minister, I think that the Committee has been misled. It is important that it should not happen again, because we will not necessarily manage to catch the Minister every time he indulges in that particular ploy.<br><br>
I come to the main points at issue. There is one factual point which the Minister might clear up because he raised the question of the amount of money which is raised by some of these proceedings. Does he have any detail, or has the Lord Chancellor's office any estimate, of what proportion of the total amount in which processes of execution in the county court are involved is recovered?<br><br>
This is an important point in relation to the question which we were considering with regard to costs. We are certainly grateful to him for the interesting figures he has provided in respect of the actual cost of the bankruptcy and the amount that is recovered on average from those who are involved in sucn proceedings. It brings out one of the reasons why the insolvency service is operating in a way which involves losses of this kind.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0995">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 75</span>
The other point I am not clear about—and perhaps the Minister would explain it—concerns the insolvency service to which we have all been referring. I am not entirely clear about its relationship to the Department. Is it part of the Department or part of the Lord Chancellor's Department? It will take only a sentence to clarify the point and may save confusion later.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
In that context the Minister has relied very heavily on an appeal to authority—, that is the technical expression that has been used about the argument—namely saying that we should rely on the advice of those in the insolvency service who are in touch from day to day with the various operations of that service and the actual events. Those in the insolvency service are not the only people who are involved in the day-to-day events; there are all those who are in practice as specialists in this particular area.<br><br>
The crucial point is that although those of his advisers who are in touch with the situation from day to day have recommended a limit of£300, the unanimous view of those who practise as specialists in this area is that it should not be£300, but less. Would the Minister please confirm whether I am right in saying that all the outside representations we have had without exception favour a lower limit than£300? As far as this legislation is concerned, the expert advice on which he is relying is not necessarily as reliable as we might wish. I certainly think we should take into account other outside expert advice, particularly when, as in this case, it appears to present a very different view from that put forward by the Minister.<br><br>
The next point concerns the actual data on which the decision to fix the limit at£300 was based. The crucial question, if one raises the limit, is to what extent is the number of cases reduced? Alternatively if one lowers the limit, to what extent is the number of cases increased? This is relevant to the consideration of where the limit should be set. The Minister has been helpful in providing figures; I understand that he proposes to provide us with other figures in writing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If they are wanted.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, they are crucial to the whole matter. If the Minister would do that, it would be helpful. Unless, however, I have totally misunderstood the figures that the Minister has just given us, which is not difficult to do in a Standing Committee when he is reading out a series of complex statistics, all of them relate to the effect of limits above£300. That is the limit which the Government have put in the Bill.<br><br>
Let us ignore the complications of the debtors' petitions and take only the creditors' petition figures. He gave us a series of figures of the breakdown of petitions up to£300, from£301 to£600, and then over£600. That is what the figures are all about. They are very useful for determining whether one ought to fix the limit at£300 or£600, but that is not the amendment we are debating. We are debating whether the limit should be£200 or£250. I am sure the Minister will correct me if I have misunderstood the position, but none of the data he put forward is relevant to this amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Charles Fletcher-Cooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am troubled about this, because I am not sure whether I agree with my hon. Friend. The figurs show that if£300 is taken, the reduction in the number of bankruptcies will be only about 16 per cent., which is, to my mind, far too low. Therefore, the figures are relevant when one is considering whether one should have an even lower minimum than£300.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: True, but that is in relation to setting a limit higher than£300. That is to say that if one reduces it from some higher figure to£300, one makes only a saving of that kind. If I understood it correctly, we still have no data on what the reduction in the number of bankruptcies covered would be if one reduced the figure from£300 to£250 or£200. Certainly the figures are not totally irrelevant; I am sorry if I gave that impressjon. They give us some idea of where the limit should be set, but they do not give us any idea whether this amendment is preferable to the Government's figure. At least, they do not give us sufficient evidence.<br><br>
Presumably, if a survey was carried out, those figures must have been produced. If that was not so, the Department approached the matter with a completely closed mind. It said that it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0996">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 77</span>
wanted only figures above£300 and not below, despite the fact that the professions as a whole were in favour of a lower limit. We hope that we shall be able to obtain from the Minister some figures which are relevant to this amendment.<br><br>
The Minister has not replied to my final point. It is rather important because a number of amendments are grouped together, some of which refer to the position in Scotland, some to England and some refer to the position under the Companies Act rather than to individuals. I agree entirely with what the Minister said at our last sitting; we would not want to fix different limits for England and Scotland. Although the two legal systems are very different, the monetary position by and large is not so different that we need have any variation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher-Cooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not yet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, not yet, but I would not want to do that. The question of companies is quite separate. Although I raised it in my opening remarks at the last sitting the Minister did not cover it. The proposition is that the limit under the Companies Act should be precisely the same as that under the Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act 1913 and the Bankruptcy Act 1914. The Minister seemed to suggest that that was a rational way of proceeding. My suspicion was that it just happened to be the limit which was fixed in this place when the matters were separately considered on former occasions.<br><br>
I am not at all clear why the limit should be the same. I should have thought that there must be a case for a higher limit in the case of companies, because clearly the position of an individual is not the same as that of a company. To have companies going insolvent for£50 is a very different matter from an individual doing so. He may be incurring debts of a totally different kind.<br><br>
For example, the individual may be involved in a debt which he incurred as a result of buying what is now the traditional three-piece suite, rather like the man on the Clapham omnibus, if we can talk all the time in terms of three-piece suites. The limit which is necessary so that people can collect debts of that kind is surely quite different from
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
that which is appropriate for a company which may have a great many creditors who have been providing raw materials and other items which have been used in manufacturing. Those debts are not likely to be of the same order of magnitude as those of individuals.<br><br>
I do not want to labour the point; it seems to me self-evident. The Minister has given us no reply. I hope that he can clarify some of these points and produce some additional data on the lines which I have suggested so that we can consider whether we are in a position to make a decision at this stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will try to deal with these matters as quickly as I can, though I do not want to fail to deal with them thoroughly. We have dealt with most of them, although I would reply to the four specific points as follows.<br><br>
Has there been any assessment of the total amount of indebtedness recovered? Not to my knowledge, but I will look into that. The insolvency service is part of the Department of Trade. The hon. Gentleman says that the insolvency service is not the only body involved; I have already dealt with that point. He says that it is a unanimous view of the professions and of Justice. In fact, Justice has stated in its recommendations that the amount of the debt, at present£50, required to justify the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings should be the subject of a sharp increase, and that the minimum should at the very least be£200. That indicates categorically that, in their view, it is a matter of a balance of judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has misquoted the question I asked him. I asked whether it was true that all the representations which he and his Department had received took the view that the limit should be less than£300. He has partly clarified that. Let me, therefore, try to make the situation clear. Apart from the quotation which he has just read, which implies a minimum of£200, which is the purpose of our amendment, in the subsequent discussions and consultations which he has had, has he known of anyone who supports the view that it should be£300 or above?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There have been the views that the hon. Gentleman himself expressed.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0997">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 79</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: From the professions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will allow me to reply to his question we shall get on more quickly. The hon. Gentleman himself adduced an argument at the last sitting that there was a case for making it£600, and I am aware of that case. The representation made to me by the professional bodies was that£300 was too much. But I am entitled to cite in support of my argument Justice's recommendation as it originally stood, that the minimum should be " at the very least "£200—" at the very least". Therefore, I say that it is a matter of balance of judgment.<br><br>
The implication of the hon. Gentleman's amendment of reducing the limit to£200 or£250 is that there would be fewer bankruptcy cases affected. I think, with respect, that this point was very appropriately dealt with by his hon. and learned Friend the Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke). The hon. Gentleman cannot escape from his own hon. and learned Friend's argument on this matter. There is bound to be a less Draconian effect if his figure of£200–E250 is applied. That is bound to be the case because we know that the percentage of total bankruptcy cases if there is a limit of£300 is 16 per cent.; if there is a limit of £600 it is 26 per cent. It is logical to assume that if the level is reduced below£200, one will not be able to deal with the matter as adequately as we are hoping to do as a result of increasing this monetary limit.<br><br>
As far as the situation in Scotland and England is concerned, we want to try to deal with the matters together as far as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are all obliged to the hon. Gentleman for the figures that he has given us, and we have a great deal to think about. One figure that interests us—and this was reflected in what my hon. and learned Friend said—is the 16 per cent. which is so low. It is difficult to see how the 16 per cent. saving there would not be far more than offset by Clause 6. However, what I am thinking is this. On the figures which he has mentioned, if it saves only 16 per cent., it means that all those people who issue bankruptcy notices in much smaller amounts and receive payment without having to go on to bankruptcy petition
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 80</span>
and, therefore, never figure in these statistics will be deprived of the opportunity to do that in order to save 16 per cent. Is that not a new factor in the equation?</span></p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman must face up to the alternatives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I respectfully suggest that he has not done that. He wants to see the bankruptcy service operating as an arm of the social services more extensively than it is doing at present. That must be paid for. That will involve increased public expenditure, and that is entirely inconsistent with the arguments that he and others parade before the House of Commons and in the country in a variety of speeches. He must face the inconsistency of his own position.<br><br>
However, I shall not elaborate on that argument. The arguments that are available to the Committee have been stated on both sides; there is no point in rehearsing them further. We must get on.<br><br>
As far as the question of the difference—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but the Minister cannot fudge what is obviously the crucial issue. I accept the point made by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke); that is certainly a valid argument on the basis of the statistics the Minister has produced. However, quite clearly the relevance of the statistics for figures below £300 is apparent as far as the amendment is concerned. If he does not have them, the only assumption must be that the Department gave no consideration to figures below this limit. I hope that he will provide us with those figures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I cannot. I have already said that I do not propose to instruct the insolvency service to embark upon a further analysis of figures below £300 because the implications of taking it below £300 are manifestly plain. It would be an abortive exercise, in my judgment, and I do not propose to do it, unless the Committee takes a different view at this stage. That it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0998">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 81</span>
perfectly entitled to do and we shall have to reflect upon that. However, I do not think that any cause will be served by undertaking a detailed analysis, which will take up to three weeks or longer, in order to provide information that we know, from the information I have already provided, would be incapable of enabling us to arrive at the sort of solutions that are desirable here.<br><br>
I will deal finally—I hope without further interruption—with the question of the difference in treatment between the insolvent company and the bankrupt. I said last time that this matter clearly calls for determination within the wider review. It is true that these matters have been dealt with together—the limit has been the same—and there may be a case, although there are arguments the other way. Certainly the whole debate calls to be dealt with within the review, but not in this limited way. Indeed, we would lack any suitable criteria or data to arrive at a judgment for departing from the present position at the moment.<br><br>
I hope that we can now proceed to vote upon this matter if the Opposition intend to press it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that was a highly unsatisfactory reply. We raised the question of what representations had been received on the specific point as far as outside bodies were concerned. The Minister in defence can only produce a figure which says that the outside bodies originally recommended that it should not be less than £200, but he confirmed the view which I had anticipated might be the case, namely, that all the subsequent representations which he has had from the professional bodies are that the figure of£300 is too high.<br><br>
I recognise that there are arguments the other way from those not on professional bodies, but he has not been able to cite a single representation from the outside body that£360 is not too high. The fact that they suggested a minimum of£200 does not mean that they think that£300 is the right figure. On the contrary, they have expressed the view—and they are operating it from day to day—that the figure ought to be less than£300. That is their unanimous view. It seems extraordinary in that position that the Minister should take so little account of these expert opinions.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 82</span>
The second point is that, although I fully recognise the helpful nature of the data which the Minister has produced, he is now point blank refusing to give us any data which is actually relevant to the amendment. We shall need to consider carefully the figures which he has given us, and we are grateful to him for letting us have them in writing. But the figures which we really need we have not been given, and that is a very unsatisfactory position. We shall have to consider whether, in the light of the figures that he has given us, we may form a good enough view to take a decision. But in the absence of these other figures—and we shall pursue the matter by way of parliamentary Question—we shall need to reconsider the position between now and Report. Given that we do not have all the data, we cannot press the matter to a Division now. It is possible that he is right, but I have not heard a single argument so far which confirms that.<br><br>
On the other point which I raised on the question of companies, again the reply is unsatisfactory. All we are told is that this limit has always had this relationship, that the figures have been the same for individuals and companies, and that therefore we should go on keeping the same relationship until there is a longterm review. It is not as though the Government have not had time to consider the points involved before the Bill was introduced. They could perfectly well have looked at that position, and looked at the arguments as to why a company's limit should be different from an individual's limit. I should not have thought that one needed a long-term review to work out the arguments. It is self-evident that the company's limit should not be the same as the individual's limit, but we shall have to consider that. I hope that the Minister will consider it between now and Report and that we shall have an amendment on that point.<br><br>
For the reasons that I have mentioned I think it would not be right to press the matter to a Division now. We have cleared a lot of the ground and we are in a much better position to take a view than we were at the last sitting. But we must await further data and study the data that the Minister has given us.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have a number of amendments suggesting that one monetary figure should be substituted for an existing monetary figure in the Bill. On the face of it, that gives an impression of homogeneity about the amendments which in fact they do not possess, because they are not all of the same kind. All these limits affect different concepts and are based on different concepts. The one which we have just been discussing is the figure which is relevant to someone going bankrupt or a firm going into insolvency.<br><br>
But this is a totally different figure, as the Committee will appreciate. The amendments which we are now considering relate to The Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act 1913, The Bankruptcy Act 1914 relating to England, and the Companies Act 1948. Amendment No. 12, which is the lead amendment, suggests that we should leave out the sections in the Scottish Act, in particular on page 10, to leave out from the beginning of line 11 to the end of line 13, which is the
<br><blockquote><p>"Maximum sum in respect of wages or salary ranking as preferential debt in division of bankrupt's estate."</p></blockquote>
The corresponding amendments are related to altering the actual figures in one of the three existing pieces of legislation. This is a quite different matter from the one which we have so far been discussing on the first monetary limit, that is, the£50 limit. We have suggested in this case that the limit of£800 should be deleted and perhaps changed to a higher figure. I hope the Minister will understand that the selection of these figures is necessarily arbitrary. Indeed, the direction in which they move is, to some extent, selected merely to ensure that we
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 84</span>
have a basis for querying the actual figure at which the Government have arrived.<br><br>
We come here to a very important series of ideas—the idea that if someone goes bankrupt or if a company becomes insolvent, certain creditors should have a preferential position compared with other creditors. That is something which naturally gives one cause for concern. We shall come at a later stage to the question whether, for example, the Inland Revenue should have preference as against other creditors. It is true that it has been traditional that the Inland Revenue should have preference, but there are certainly those, including unsecured creditors other than the Inland Revenue, who do not always agree with the view that the Inland Revenue ought to get in first, because generally speaking the unsecured creditors have lost the money which they originally had, whereas the Inland Revenue is simply failing to get the money that it was hoping to get.<br><br>
In this case, we have a particular set of creditors who are said to be in a position where they ought to get preference, namely, those who are owed wages or salaries. I apologise for the fact that I am not quite clear whether the£800 figure is for the total or the individual. As I understood it from our earlier exchanges, it is for the individual.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. This is the maximum amount which an individual can get if another individual or firm goes bankrupt. That seems to be quite a large amount because, after all, we have now arrived at the position where the Government's proposal is that someone can go bankrupt for£300, and the preference which would be given to those owed wages or salaries is to be£800 each; so there is a fairly large gap between those two figures.<br><br>
Therefore, the question arises as to whether it is right that those who are owed wages and salaries should have preference over, for example, an individual who has supplied a firm with raw materials. It may well be that that individual, perhaps himself self-employed, is every bit as dependent upon getting the money for the goods which he has supplied to the firm as an individual who has been employed by the firm. The person who was previously employed by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1000">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 85</span>
the firm which has become insolvent may have managed to find another job. At all events, he is likely to be protected to some extent by redundancy pay and various other social security benefits. That may not be the case so far as another small businessman, perhaps self-employed, is concerned, who has used his own money to produce goods which he has sold to the person or firm which has become insolvent, and then does not get a thing. He is not likely to find any social security benefit which will recompense him for that.<br><br>
I had an experience of this near my constituency some years ago, in the disastrous events of the Beagle Aircraft company and the Government support, where local tradesmen were under the impression that the Government had backed the Beagle Aircraft company and that they would get their money back. The present Secretary of State for Energy was much involved in that case. On the whole, it was not the employees who suffered. It was the large number of local people—some of them small self-employed businessmen—who had advanced supplies to this enterprise when it finally, despite Government handouts, became insolvent.<br><br>
The main point is quite clear. We should like the Minister to put forward the basis on which he feels that this preference should continue and, in particular, why he feels that the figure should be the one that he has selected. One could conceivably argue for a higher or lower figure. It is a question of what the position is so far as the Government see it, and we shall then no doubt wish to take up the various points which they put forward in support of their figure.</span></p>
<p>12 noon.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was in some difficulty in understanding the logic of the amendment of the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) because, on the one hand, he was arguing that the£800 was too high, and, on the other hand, he was arguing that it was too low. There was no doubt that the hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) was taking a strong view on Second Reading. As hon. Members will see in col. 14–80 of <i>Hansard,</i> he argued strongly that this form of preference should be substantially eroded.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
Perhaps I should open my remarks by repeating what I said on Second Reading. This is a difficult matter which falls to be dealt with more appropriately in the wider review of bankruptcy law. There are anomalies about the way in which preferential creditors are treated. It is appropriate, therefore, that we should look into the matter in depth. I hope that we shall be able to arrive at a more satisfactory conclusion than is the case at present.<br><br>
As I understand it, the amendment would have the effect of depriving workers of having brought up to date the value of the present monetary limit which was fixed in 1974 at£200, for arrears of wages or salary ranking as preferential debt. It is sequestration in Scotland, bankruptcy in England and Wales, and liquidation for companies.<br><br>
It is perfectly true that the position of the employee has been improved, so far as the arrears of wages and salary are concerned, by the 1975 Employment Protection Act. The relevant insolvency sections of that Act came into operation on 20th of this month. However, having said that, it would be undesirable to increase the monetary limits in insolvency law, so as generally to restore their value, and yet make an exception in the case of workers' preferential wages and salary by restricting the maximum amount to the figure of £200 fixed in 1947, which would be the effect, as I understand it, of the first amendment. Of course, as the hon. Gentleman said, this is a probing amendment, but its effect would be to put workers at a serious disadvantage compared with other preferential credit-tors, whose claims were not subject to any monetary limit.<br><br>
The sections of the 1975 Act provide that in the event of an employer becoming insolvent, employees will receive early payment out of the Redundancy Fund of up to eight weeks' arrears of wages, payment in lieu of notice, holiday pay, and so on, up to a total not exceeding £80 a week. The Secretary of State for Employment will then stand in the shoes of the employees in respect of the moneys which are paid out and will be entitled to claim in the bankruptcy or liquidation.<br><br>
Any increase in the monetary limit for preferential wages or salary would also benefit any person, for example, as was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1001">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
stated by the hon. and learned Gentleman on Second Reading, such a bankrupt, who would be able to claim similar rights by subrogation under Section 319(4) of the 1948 Companies Act. This section provides for any person advancing moneys for the purpose of paying wages, which have in fact been paid out of those moneys, to have the same right of preference as the employees would have had if their wages had not been so paid.<br><br>
Different views are legitimately held about the desirability of this right of subrogation. One view is that it operates to the disadvantage of the unsecured creditor. On the other hand, the banks, in particular, wish to seek an extension of the present right. We shall have to strike a balance so that banks are not deterred from providing financial assistance by advancing moneys to pay wages in suitable cases where there is perhaps a cash flow problem. Companies frequently find themselves in temporary difficulties and have to apply to the bank in these circumstances. This has the advantage of continuing employment prospects which otherwise might disappear. These are social and economic considerations which it is important to take into account in the proper context—that is to say, in a profound analysis of the position which, as I have indicated, the Department is undertaking.<br><br>
I should point out that the right ol subrogation applies only to liquidations—to companies which are being wound up. It is not every case where moneys have been advanced for the payment of wages, so that they would have themselves to claim for any arrears.<br><br>
In conclusion, it would be wrong to treat this matter in isolation. The hon. Gentleman has got a point. I am not sure which of his points is the more valid—the up or the down—but it would be wrong to extract this point of principle from the Bill and say that workers should now be disadvantaged—as they clearly would be—by being treated in a different way from other preferential creditors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. R. A. McCrindle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the advantages of a non-lawyer addressing the Committee is that substantially greater brevity is likely to be the case than in some of the speeches to which I have listened in the last two sittings of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
Committee. Having said that, I am not sure that my colleagues on the Front Bench will be entirely grateful to me for this intervention, because I am not sure that I go the whole way with all the amendments.<br><br>
We are discussing the position of preferential creditors. We are asking ourselves whether wages should continue to be a basis for preference. I am content to express the feeling that, because a person, when his wages are involved, is concerned with his whole livelihood—something which goes to the heart of his existence—there has traditionally been a good argument in favour of wages owed to a person being treated in preference to other debts. On the face of it, there is no reason why this should be changed at this juncture.<br><br>
On the other hand, on at least one of the amendments we are discussing the possibility of increasing the figure of£800 in the Bill to£1,000 as the amount which should be taken as a preferential creditor position. I wonder whether that is entirely justified. If we take either£800 or£1,000, we are talking about something between a quarter and a third of the average annual wage in 1976. We are therefore presuming that it is likely that something like three to four months would go by on a person losing his job before he would be likely to gain another job and resume his earning capacity. I wonder whether that is entirely justified beyond a period when, as at this moment, unemployment is higher than any of us would wish.<br><br>
I think that the whole matter is due to go back into the melting pot. Whether the figure should be higher than£800, or whether it should be lower, is an open question. It is also an open question whether the effect of inflation on wage rates should be taken wholly into account, and be the sole criterion for our decision, or whether a feeling of greater justice for all, including, as my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing said, some small creditors, who frequently find themselves in just as difficult a position employees who are owed wages, should prevail. The whole matter is ripe for fuller investigation than is possible under the Bill.<br><br>
The other point which must be taken into account is that employees have been the recipients of great improvements in the legislative treatment accorded to them
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1002">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 89</span>
in such measures as the Employment Protection Act to which the Minister has referred. I wonder whether it is wise to deal with this matter in such isolation as the amendment would suggest.<br><br>
On balance, my feeling is that there is an argument for continuing to give preference to employees' wages as a preferred credit, but, on the other hand, looking closely to see whether we are right to impose a figure of something between a quarter and a third of an annual wage. I believe that for the moment what is contained in the schedule to the Bill is about right. In these circumstances, it might be better if my hon. Friends were not to press the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will put the mind of my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) at rest immediately. The lawyers who normally have to carry the burden of these Committees are only too glad when laymen chip in. The Bills are highly technical and we are stuck with the technical part. If we do not explain them we get taken to task, quite rightly. If we explain them, it takes too long. Never mind, the backs of the lawyers in the House have been carrying this burden for a long time and I have no doubt will continue to do so. But of course it produces a much better balance if one can have the lay—the consumer's—point of view as well and then take a judgment based on what is learnt from both those points of view.<br><br>
The purpose of what my hon. Friend calls the leading amendment is to leave out any variation here, and is in line with the reasoning of most of what my hon. Friend has just said. It is a large topic. There is a tremendous amount to be looked at in this area. A substantial view in depth of it has been promised for some time. We hope that it will take place. I can say now that we shall be only too willing to play a full part in it and, we hope, in arriving at decisions, which is so much better than only coming in after decisions have been taken, as one does in the normal legislative process.<br><br>
The reasoning behind the first amendment is this: is it really right to tinker with this at the moment? That is what this provision is doing. It is merely
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
bringing into line with certain index values two figures that appear in these various statutes, and bringing them into line with one another, when in this field there is no reason why they should be the same. There is one good reason why they should not be the same. That is that in the companies' sector a bank is subrogated to the rights of the employees. But a bank may build up a preference to an enormous amount if the figure is raised to£800 per employee, thus leaving the rest of the creditors possibly with very little. One can see that in the case of the individual it may be said that it is necessary to bring this up more into line—whether it be£800 or some other figure is a matter for argument—and that there should be a substantial increase because there is no question of subrogation of the bank in that case and it is right that the individual should be protected.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend has said, employees now, under the Redundancy Payments Act 1965, the Employment Protection Act 1975 and one thing and another, have, quite rightly, been given many other forms of protection. No one is saying, and it is not to be implied from the amendments we are moving, that we are against employees having some protection. Indeed, many of us would like to see a new form of protection, a super-preference given to employees for a more limited amount. It makes little sense any longer to assume that an employee will go without pay for three months and then be a preferential creditor in the bankruptcy court which is what we are talking about. It is not realistic.<br><br>
What one would like to see—this is not original, it is referred to in the Blagden Report and in the Justice committee report and has been put into effect in the New Zealand bankruptcy law—some sort of super-preference being given to employees for a smaller amount and, therefore, giving them a real and better protection in respect of the sort of amounts that are most likely to be important to them, rather than giving them this very big preference which is shared with other people, including the Inland Revenue, and extends to an amount which is not likely to be important to them. That is one of the things which needs to be considered carefully before we make any change in this area.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1003">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
Another is the difference between companies and individuals, the difference between company insolvency and bankruptcy. There is an enormous difference in that, in a company insolvency, the bank is, by Section 319, given the right of subrogation. Reference was made by my hon. Friend to looking after the banks. I think banks look after themselves pretty well at present, with the assistance of the law, because, by a combination of Section 319 plus floating charges and revolving credits, a bank may build up a large preference. This means that a bank may go on advancing money to keep a business going which does not have a future. It is kept going not at the expense of the State or anybody else, but at the expense of the trade creditors who have to provide the materials to keep those jobs going, and when it goes bust those who have contributed to keeping it going are low down in the queue.<br><br>
Another proposal that has been mooted here for years is that preferential creditors, including the Inland Revenue and the banks, should have their preference but, say, to a maximum of 50 per cent. of the assets, so that other creditors, particularly trade creditors, may find that, even though there are preferred creditors for substantial sums, at least 50 per cent. of the assets are available to them. This again is something which should be considered as part of the review of these figures which the Opposition quite agree is overdue.<br><br>
Our amendments open up two fields for the consideration of the Committee. We believe that they merit public examination and discussion in this Committee so that those outside may know what the thinking is in this place about these matters and let us have their views as well. First, the reasoning behind the leading amendment is: do not tinker with it at the moment. We are all agreed that a review in depth is necessary, so let us get on with it and do the job properly. It need not take long, because a great deal of ground work has been done.<br><br>
The other amendment concerning the amount is a probing amendment. We are not suggesting that£1,000 is necessarily the right amount.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
It would help if the Minister could give us a little of the thinking of the Government on those matters to which I have referred, because he knows that they have been under discussion since Blagden and long before. If we felt that reasonable progress was being made, that consultations were taking place on these issues and there might be an opportunity to reach a conclusion on them in a reasonable time, it might well affect our views on these amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I seek clarification on one or two points? I think we can make fairly rapid progress on this because the position is becoming pretty clear. Certainly the Minister's suggestions that one should somehow take steps to ensure that banks give support to companies which pay wages and subsequently go bankrupt seems slightly odd. I am not sure how one would set about achieving that probably highly undesirable objective. It would put the banks in the position of a kind of mini-National Enterprise Board. But leaving that on one side, as it has been pointed out, we have two sets of amendments. One is to restore or maintain the <i>status quo</i> of the£200 limit in order to avoid tinkering until we have taken a view on the subject. The other is to put it up to£1,000.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle), who intervened saying he was not sure if he supported me on my amendment, was absolutely right. He could, at most, support me on only 50 per cent. of them, and neither the Minister nor we ourselves are absolutely sure which 50 per cent. we ought to support.<br><br>
As I understand it, the Minister is saying that the Secretary of State for Employment will advance wages in these circumstances, and then stand in the shoes of the individual concerned. I am not clear—this is something which we shall need to consider between now and Report—whether the extent to which the Secretary of State for Employment will pay out the wages will be for the full amount of those wages outstanding, or only for the amount of wages which he may hope to recover as a preferential creditor rather than simply as a creditor.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1004">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 93</span>
I am not clear which of those two circumstances is correct. Would the Minister clarify that? Obviously there are important implications, not merely for the individual or the firm concerned, but also for the general position of the Secretary of State. As the Minister has already pointed out, it may well be that the Secretary of State is in some difficulty on this matter.<br><br>
The other point is that the Minister says that the Secretary of State, or anyone else, will only be in this position of standing in the employee's shoes if a company goes insolvent, rather than if an individual goes insolvent. If so, are we to understand that if an individual who employs people becomes insolvent, the Secretary of State will not carry out this arrangement, and will neither pay the wages nor be a preferential creditor? I was not clear about that either. I have received representations from sub-contractors or main contractors in the building industry, which is probably the most difficult area so far as this is concerned.<br><br>
Would the Minister clarify those two points—first, whether the amount paid out by the Secretary of State, who then subsequently ranks as preferential creditor, is the full amount or only the amount of the preferential credit; secondly, the position of the Secretary of State in relation to an individual who has been employing people?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The remarks of the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) were those which I would have put far less eloquently myself. He came to the basic conclusion that these were matters which were ripe for careful examination in depth, and I entirely endorse that. Indeed, I tried to say it in my opening remarks. That review is in progress. It will involve consultation with professional bodies, and anyone else who feels that he has a contribution to make in determining rather better the way in which the whole system of preferential debt should be governed.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) alluded once again to the contrast between bankruptcy and company liquidation. I have already referred to that problem in a previous debate. It also falls within the review. There would be a difficulty in another connection—however, I shall not pursue
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
that. It would be out of order to refer to the monetary limits at this point.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman said that banks could be encouraged, by virtue of this preference, in effect to be somewhat careless of the interests of other creditors. I do not think that likely. Banks are very careful about providing additional financial assistance in a situation where a company is running into a cash flow problem, or temporary difficulties. A bank will normally seek some form of security, and wish to have some evidence that the company is going to be viable if the bank takes this step. It is in a sense unreal to postulate the position in the way that the hon. and learned Gentleman did.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>:s I did not want to infer that banks were being careless of anybody else's interest. It is perfectly right that they look to their interests, and when they are lending money the question is what their rights will be if the company goes into liquidation. As the hon. Gentleman says, if they take security, so be it, but that is another matter. If they take security, that security can be registered, and other people before considering doing more trade, can find out how to secure preferential rights.<br><br>
On the reality of it, this is what brought me to my feet. I do not know the facts personally, any more than the hon. Gentleman does, but my information is that it is becoming common, in substantial liquidations and bankruptcies, to find that the Inland Revenue and the banks between them take the lion's share. This has been the case with the Inland Revenue for some time, but my information is that it has been growing in relation to banks. I leave it at that. The hon. Gentleman can perhaps find out whether that is so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may be the case. One frequently sees the Inland Revenue playing a notable role in these matters. But the hon. Gentleman asked me specifically what was the thinking of the Government. The thinking of the Government must depend upon the evidence and the advice that they receive in this long-term review. It would be premature for me to make judgments about these difficult issues, and the review will
take some considerable time. In the meantime, it would be unfair to make an

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
exception, as I said at the beginning, as far as the revision of these monetary limits is concerned, to the detriment of the employee. I hope, 'therefore, that hon. Gentlemen will not pursue this amendment.<br><br>
I turn finally to the points made by hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins). He asked if the Secretary of State for Employment has rights of subrogation. Yes, he has; he will have those rights, and he will be in the position of a preferential creditor, up to the maximum sum of£800. He will not rank as a preferential creditor in excess of that sum, as I understand it.<br><br>
The Secretary of State for Employment also has the same rights of subrogation as far as bankruptcy is concerned, in contradistinction to the usual position. That was defined by the Employment Protection Act, and is not dealt with in the bankruptcy legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think perhaps the Minister was distracted at the moment when I was putting the points to which he has just referred. My point was this. I am not entirely clear if this is to be the arrangement. Supposing a firm goes bankrupt owning some of its employees back pay, as I understand it the proposal is that the Secretary of State will presumably always, in these circumstances, advance the back pay to the individual employees concerned. He will then rank as a preferential creditor up to these limits. I was not clear whether it is proposed that he should advance any amount of the wages outstanding over and above these limits, but only rank as a preferential creditor for these amounts, and a non-preferential creditor for the other amounts.<br><br>
If that is so, it would seem to involve the Secretary of State for Employment to the extent that the firm does not have assets which meet the full amount of other creditors but, perhaps, gets only a share of the non-preferential bit, so to speak—the Government themselves will be taking over part of this liability. That was really the point I was making, not the one to which the Minister referred. The other point I also raised was why this should be so in the case of a firm but not in the case of an individual who, perhaps, had been employing people.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In fact, the matters dealt with under the Employment Protection Act 1975 provide, as I understand it, that the Secretary of State for Employment will be regarded as a preferential creditor only up to the limit of£800; beyond that he ranks as an ordinary creditor. I thought I had made that clear. I understood, when the hon. Gentleman posed the question to me before about the difference between the company in liquidation and the individual in bankruptcy, that he was seeking to know the position of the Secretary of State for Employment. However, in this instance he has the same right of subrogation in both cases. I hope that answers the hon. Gentleman's point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I understood the Minister to say, in an earlier intervention, that that was not the position, that this question of priority only applied in the case of a firm and not in the case of an individual employer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is why I said that it seemed to me to breach the normality of the situation. The Employment Protection Act has dealt with the matter differently in that singular respect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think I understand that. I shall have to refer back to the Employment Protection Act. The Minister has been helpful on this and I do not think there is any great disagreement on it. In the light of what he has said, we all recognise the argument in this particular case, although it will need to be considered with the other arguments for and against preferential creditors when we come to the longer term review.<br><br>
In the light of what the Minister has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 14, in page 10, line 14, leave out£4,000 ' and insert£5,000'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall consider at the same time Amendment No. 26, in page 11, line 3, leave out£4,000 ' and insert£5,000'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are concerned here with the figures which the Government have suggested as far as the maximum
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1006">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 97</span>
value of debtor's assets for summary sequestration is concerned, and also the maximum value of a debtor's estate for summary administration—one of the amendments referring to the position under the Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act 1913, and the other under the Bankruptcy Act 1914.<br><br>
I see that you, in your wisdom, Mr. English, have suggested that we should take them together and, therefore, I suspect this means that the two different expressions in the existing legislation refer to the same thing. However, at the risk of provoking the Minister into saying that he is not going to provide a glossary, perhaps he could explain precisely what it is that these two matters refer to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments would have the effect, as I see it, of increasing the present monetary limit of £300 to£5,000 as the maximum value of assets in a sequestration or bankruptcy which can, by order of the court, be administered in a summary way. The sequestration relates to Scotland. I am bound to say that I know nothing about Scottish law. I find it a total mystery, so I am hoist by my own petard as far as that is concerned.<br><br>
The object of an order of court for summary administration of bankruptcy is to provide a streamlining of procedure and to reduce the costs. In summary bankruptcies in England and Wales, the Official Receiver remains trustee of the bankrupt's estate unless the creditors, by special resolution, resolve that some person other than the Official Receiver be appointed trustee. In that case, the bankruptcy then proceeds as if an order for summary administration had not been made.<br><br>
The increase to£5,000 of the summary limit would impose even more work on the insolvency service. Perhaps it would be helpful if I were to say something about the summary procedure, as I think the hon. Gentleman was inviting me to do. This procedure is possible at the moment where there are assets of less than£300 and the streamlining has the effect of dispensing with the need for advertisement, the Official Receiver remains the trustee and the costs allowable are restricted. This procedure is quite successful in a number of matters.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
The figure of£4,000 has been arrived at in this way. If we were to increase the present limit of£300 in the way we have previously by a multiplier of 12, we would arrive at a figure of£3,600 to restore the value. We thought it would be better simply to round it up to£4,000 and, for the reasons I have adduced—it is a matter of balance of judgment—we thing the figure of£5,000 is more logical. I do not know why£5,000 has been lighted upon. It seems to have been clawed out of the air; it was, perhaps, the first figure the hon. Gentleman thought of. I do not want to prolong the debate, so I must not be provocative.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel it appropriate to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher-Cooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understood from the Minister that summary administration imposes no greater a burden on the insolvency service than does the ordinary process of bankruptcy. Indeed, I gather that it is the opposite; that the summary process, not involving advertisement and so on, imposes a lesser burden on the insolvency service. Since we all want to do that as much as possible, there is a case for considering whether the£4,000 can be " upped " considerably.<br><br>
As I told the Committee on Tuesday, I showed these figures to some of the Chancery judges who deal in bankruptcies, and one of them took his silver-plated pencil out of his pocket, struck through£4,000 and put in£8,000. I do not wish to pray this in aid as showing the unanimity of the views of outside bodies because this was undoubtedly a privileged occasion.<br><br>
On the other amendment, I was unable to support my hon. Friends when they sought to reduce the figure. But here, when they seek to increase the figure and thus reduce the burden on the insolvency service, we should be grateful if it could be looked at again. Perhaps some calculations could be made such as were so helpfully given by the Minister earlier this morning when we were discussing the painful subject of£300,£250 and£200.<br><br>
It would be of great assistance to both sides of the Committee if the hon. Gentleman could. either now or at a later stage,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1007">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
give us some idea of the savings that would be involved in the figures of£4,000,£5,000 and£8,000, if that is not too difficult. I think these figures should be increased. As to by how much, I am entirely a child in the hands of those who have the statistical machine at their command, but the principle of increasing the £4,000 figure and, when we come to a later amendment, the jurisdiction of the county court figure, seems to me to he overwhelming.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps through my own fault I did not make the position as clear as I should have done. It is true that, as a result of the streamlining procedure, the burden on the insolvency service is reduced. On the other hand, the more that the limit is increased, the more situations will arise where the Official Receiver remains the trustee, and to that extent, therefore, the balance of work will fall more heavily upon him. I will look at the point the hon. Gentleman makes, but it is not very easy to evaluate this situation. I hope that I have explained more clearly than in my earlier remarks the difficulty that arises if the limit is increased.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to the Under-Secretary for the undertaking that he will look at my hon. and learned Friend's points in the light of the representations which were made to him, even if only written with a silver-plated pencil. Goodness knows what would have happened if it had been a gold pencil. There seem to be some arguments in favour of a higher limit. If one ignores the simple inflation adjustment and says that one is rounding it up from£3,600 to£4,000, one could perhaps round it up to an even rounder figure of the kind we have suggested. But in view of the Minister's undertaking to look at it again, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be appropriate, Mr. English, as both you and I have received notice that the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) wishes to make certain representations in relation to a Sittings Motion—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. It is true that I had indicated to you earlier, and I gather that it has been conveyed to the Minister, that I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
wished to make various points on the Sittings Motion. Following our subsequent exchanges, I still wish to make one or two points, but not at any great length. Perhaps therefore you would like to proceed a little longer, if you find it convenient.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall start the discussion on Amendment No. 15.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 15, in page 10, line 16, leave out£120 ' and insert '£200'.<br><br>
This amendment is related to the process of sequestration. Such is the power of argument that, having learned a little this morning about sequestration, and having learned that it is a streamlining procedure—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Summary sequestration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, summary sequestration is a streamlining procedure, and therefore one which saves time and expense. Following that information, I am persuaded to the view that my hon. and learned Friend has just voiced, that it is a procedure to be encouraged, and I look at Amendment No. 15 in that light.<br><br>
To encourage the use of this procedure, one should lower the figure of£120 rather than raise it, in order to make it available to more people so that they will tend to use it rather than not use it. This is a probing amendment and not one of great consequence. If the Minister could give us some indication as to why the figure was chosen, we need go no further than that and—I say in advance—I could then consider withdrawing the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The figure of£120 is simply a multiplier of the present limit of£10 which was laid down in the Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act 1913.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 16, in page 10, line 26, leave out£120 ' and insert£75'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>Amendment No. 17, in page 10, line 26, leave out£120 ' and insert£250'.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1008">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 101</span>
<p>Amendment No. 27, in page 11, line 9, leave out£120 ' and insert£200'.</p>
<p>Amendment No. 28, in page 11, line 9, leave out£120 ' and insert£75'.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The object of Amendment No. 16 is to amend line 26 on page 10 which is concerned with the limit of£120 related to an
<br><blockquote><p>"Offence by undischarged bankrupt of obtaining credit confined to cases where value of credit exceeds a minimum amount."</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 17 is simply an alternative set of figures. Amendment No. 27 is the same point in relation to the English law. Amendment No. 28 again alters the figures in relation to the English law. None of these relates to the situation with regard to companies. Perhaps it is unfor- tunate that it gives the impression that we are moving or propounding far more amendments than is actually the case. There are three initial sets of legislation and, therefore, one doubles or triplicates the number of amendments which one appears to be seeking to make. At all events, the lead amendment is Amendment No. 16 which is related to line 26. We are concerned here with how far one ought to raise the limit because that, as Is understand it, is what the Bill does, as regards an offence by an undischarged bankrupt of obtaining credit.<br><br>
I presume—the Minister will no doubt correct me if I am wrong—that this is related to the fact that an undischarged bankrupt can obtain credit only up to a certain amount without committing an offence. This will cause us some concern in later stages of the Bill, because we discovered on Second Reading and previously that the country now has a very large number of undischarged bankrupts. A figure of 60,000 was mentioned earlier. They are at present prohibited from obtaining credit in excess of a certain amount. It is clearly undesirable that this should be the case, and I believe that the Minister will at a later stage in the proceedings move amendments which will seek to do something about that. We shall consider those amendments on their merits when they are moved.<br><br>
Even so, it is undesirable that people should commit offences, because the restrictions that have been placed on them—in a sense because they volunteered not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 102</span>
to be discharged in some cases—are so onerous. That being so, how far should one go? The Government have gone quite a long way. It is arguable whether one should go further or not so far. The Minister might like to deal with this point in anticipation of the debate we shall have later so that, if possible, we can agree on the basis of the subsequent discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher-Cooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While the Minister is considering this point may I give him another point to consider? The offence of obtaining credit while an undischarged bankrupt is an absolute offence. There is no <i>mens rea,</i> to use another technical term, involved. Even though one does not intend to commit the offence, if one commits it one is guilty. The late unfortunate Duke of Leinster is the leading case in this regard. It is, therefore, very important, when one is fixing sums which may have an effect on the offence of obtaining credit without disclosing that one is an undischarged bankrupt, to have sums which are well-known, round figures, which will be spread abroad. It is only fair that the sums in this branch of the bankruptcy law should not be multipliers of any other sum or be mathematically calculated to a degree of nicety, but that they should be good, round figures like£50,£100 or whatever the right level is, but not£75 or£125. That is my view, as the offence is a serious offence. It is even more important where it is an absolute offence, not requiring intention.<br><br>
I am not sure whether this is the right stage of the Bill at which to make his point, but in the general consideration of offences committed by undischarged bankrupts of obtaining credit, and so on, which will be explored in later clauses, as my hon. Friend has said, I seriously suggest that the psychology of the potential criminal, and the psychology of the general public, particularly of those who may be inclined to extend credit, be considered, so that we may consider the effects on the criminal law of this absolute offence, which is one of the oldest absolute offences known to the code.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly this subject deserves careful attention. In rather less than seven minutes—because I shall have to interrupt myself—it is not appropriate for me to seek to dispose
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1009">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 103</span>
of the arguments today. The points made by the hon. and learned Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke) are important. I am concerned about his last point in particular.<br><br>
I take the Committee into my confidential thoughts about the matter. I am a little disturbed that it is possible for debtors in these situations to accumulate debts. Therefore, one would be able to prosecute a debtor only for a single offence—for obtaining credit up to a maximum of£120 without disclosing that he was an undischarged bankrupt. It is conceivable that somebody could obtain sums of £50 here and£75 there without necessarily committing an offence. It may be that there are other offences with which he could be charged, but the situation is, at the very least, a little vague.<br><br>
Again, we shall have to address our minds to whether using a simple multiplier of this kind is the right way to proceed, or whether there should be other safeguards, or whether we should look carefully into the situation in the wider review of bankruptcy law. I am sure that that last suggestion is one which will have to be applied.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Rather than to-ing and fro-ing on whether this or that amount is right, has the Minister considered the suggestion made by Justice in its report on bankruptcy that we might totally eliminate all consideration of figures and make the offence relate simply to whether the debt incurred, irrespective of the amount, has been repaid by a certain period?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a difficult matter. Again, it is not easy to deal with it within the framework of a Bill like this, which has been exposed to the Second Reading Committee procedure, and so on. It is supposed to be non-contentious.<br><br>
I think that it would be better if I were to interrupt my remarks at this stage, Mr. English.</span></p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That during the further proceedings on the Insolvency Bill [<i>Lords</i>] the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.—[<i>Mr. Clinton Davis.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the proposal is that the Committee should in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 104</span>
future sit on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10.30. I thought that the Minister's original Sittings Motion was either very optimistic or remarkably flexible, but I was not quite clear which. He said just now that the Bill was supposed to be non-controversial. I do not think anyone on this side of the Committee thought that it was non-controversial. We took the trouble to consult outside interests, and it was perfectly clear that they were extremely worked up about it. This is the main point that I want to make on this motion.<br><br>
I will not go over the ground that the Government did not carry out adequate consultations before the Bill was produced, although that has clearly been the case. As I understand it, they have been engaging in many consultations with interested parties outside since that happened. We look forward with anticipation—there are already some amendments on the Amendment Paper—to further Government amendments appearing. We will then need to consider them carefully to see whether they go far enough and whether our own amendments are preferable to the Government's.<br><br>
The problem is that the wheels of Government internally appear to have been grinding pretty slowly and some of the amendments which we hoped might be tabled have not been tabled. No doubt this is for various inter-departmental reasons. The difficulty we then find ourselves in is that we do not have adequate time to consult outside interests. It is extremely important that we should, because this might even—indeed it would—speed up the proceedings of the Committee. If we can accept the Government amendments, that is an end of the matter; but if we find that the outside interests object and think, rightly or wrongly, there are arguments to be put the other way, or if we are not sure, we need to debate both our own amendments and those of the Government. (liven the complexity of the Bill—I must say that Clauses 5 and 6 will be complex—it is likely to be a time-consuming process.<br><br>
I do not wish to vote against the Sittings Motion, but I hope that if there is need for further consultation of this kind we might be able to introduce, or re-introduce, an element of flexibility into the actual time. We may need more
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1010">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 105</span>
time to conduct the consultations, because the Government have not tabled their amendments fast enough for these consultations to be carried out. If that can be cleared up, I would not wish to oppose the Sittings Motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall have to see how things work out. We have of course consulted widely on the amendments, which I hope will be tabled today and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
appear on the Amendment Paper next Tuesday.</span></p>
